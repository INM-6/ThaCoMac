See also dietary diarrhea. pain [pn] an apparently noxious sensory experience that causes an animal to move or adopt protective behaviors in order to avoid or reduce or eliminate its intensity All receptors for pain stimuli are free nerve endings of groups of myelinated or unmyelinated neural fibers abundantly distributed in the superficial layers of the skin and in certain deeper tissues such as the periosteum, surfaces of the joints, arterial walls, and the falx and tentorium of the cranial cavity. The distribution of pain receptors in the gastrointestinal mucosa apparently is similar to that in the skin; thus, the mucosa is quite sensitive to irritation and other painful stimuli. Although the parenchyma of the liver and the alveoli of the lungs are almost entirely insensitive to pain, the liver as an organ and the bile ducts are extremely sensitive, as are the bronchi, ureters, parietal pleura, and peritoneum. Some pain receptors are selective in their response to stimuli, but most are sensitive to more than one of the following types of excitation: (1) mechanical stress of trauma; (2) extremes of heat and cold; and (3) chemical substances, such as histamine, potassium ions, acids, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and acetylcholine. The conscious perception of pain probably takes place in the thalamus and lower centers; interpretation of the quality of pain is probably the role of the cerebral cortex. There are some naturally occurring internal systems in the body that are known to control pain but none of them has been completely verified. One of the best known is the gate control system in which it is thought that pain impulses are mediated in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. abdominal p. pain occurring in the area between the thorax and pelvis. Manifestations vary between species. Identifiable syndromes include: (1) horsepawing, flank watching, rolling, straddling as though to urinate, lying on the back; (2) cattlemay depress back and paddle with hindfeet but mostly arched back, grunting, immobility; (3) dogs and cats arched back, grunting, depression, reluctance to move. Sometimes there is elevation of the hindquarters, with the chest and forelegs on the ground (the so-called praying dog attitude). Beagle p. syndrome see steroid responsive meningitis-arteritis. endogenous p. caused by factors within the body, e.g., stretching of mesentery. p. hypersensitivity responsiveness to noxious stimuli that produces exaggerated and prolonged pain. May be either peripheral sensitization, which is a reduction in threshold and an increase in responsiveness of the peripheral ends of nociceptors, or central, which is an increase in the excitability of neurons within the central nervous system. projected p. lesions in one area can affect the nerve supply to a distant area in which pain is experienced. p. receptors free nerve endings of tufts of fine points or buttons. referred p. pain felt in an area distant from the site of disease but not mediated through a common innervation. There is no evidence that referred pain occurs in animals but it seems likely on anatomical grounds. p. threshold the lowest level at which a stimulus can be applied and cause perceptible pain. p. tolerance the level of stimulation at which pain becomes intolerable. visceral p. caused by inflammation of serous surfaces, distention of viscera and inflammation or compression of peripheral nerves. The pain caused by stretching of the wall of a hollow viscus is often intermittent because of its alternating relaxation and spasm in response to distention. paint [pnt] commercial paint products are used in animal accommodation.

The pancreas is composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissue. The acini secrete digestive enzymes, and small ductules leading from the acini secrete ions, mainly sodium and bicarbonate. The combined product, pancreatic juice, enters a long pancreatic duct and from there is transported duct to the duodenum. The pancreatic juice contains enzymes for the breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The bicarbonate ions in the pancreatic secretion help neutralize the acidic chyme that is passed along from the stomach to the duodenum. The endocrine functions of the pancreas are related to the islets of Langerhans that occur throughout the pancreas. These small islands contain three major types of cells: the alpha, beta, and delta cells. The alpha cells secrete the hormone glucagon, which elevates blood sugar. The beta cells secrete insulin, which affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The delta cells secrete somatostatin, the functions of which inhibits the secretion of both glucagon and insulin and may act as a controller of metabolic processes. The somatostatin produced by the delta cells of the pancreas is the same as that produced by the hypothalamus as an inhibitor of the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. p. disease pancreatic atrophy of postsmolt Atlantic salmon caused by a togavirus infection; clinical signs include anorexia, emaciation.

The parathyroid contains two types of cell: chief cells and oxyphils. Chief cells are the major source of parathyroid hormone (PTH), the secretion of which is dependent on the serum calcium concentration. Through a closed-loop feedback mechanism a low serum calcium concentration stimulates secretion of PTH; conversely, a high serum calcium concentration inhibits its secretion. The essential role of PTH is maintenance of a normal serum calcium concentration in association with vitamin D and calcitonin. p. gland hyperplasia may be focal and nodular or, more importantly diffuse. The latter occurs in cases suffering long-standing nutritional deficiency of calcium or renal insufficiency. p. hormone (PTH) a simple, straight-chain polypeptide, synthesized in chief cells and stored in secretory granules. The hormone stimulates the formation and activity of resorptive osteocytes so that calcium is released into body fluids without extensive bone remodeling.

Called also D-penicillamine. penicillic acid [pen-silik] a mycotoxin with antibiotic and carcinogenic acivity produced by various species of Penicillium and Aspergillus. penicillin [pen-silin] any of a large group of natural or semisynthetic antibacterial drugs derived directly or indirectly from strains of fungi of the genus Penicillium and other soil-inhabiting fungi grown on special culture media. Penicillins exert a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect on susceptible bacteria by interfering with the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, a component of the bacterial cell wall. Despite their relatively low toxicity for the host, penicillins are active against many bacteria, especially gram-positive pathogens such as streptococci, some staphylococci and clostridia, as well as certain gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes (Treponema pallidum and T. pertenue), and fungi. Certain strains of some target species, for example, staphylococci, secrete the enzyme penicillinase, which inactivates penicillin and confers resistance to the antibiotic. Some of the staphylococcal penicillins, for example, methicillin, are more effective against penicillinase-producing organisms. An additional class of extended-spectrum penicillins has been approved for use; it includes piperacillin, ticarcillin, and mezlocillin. Penicillins are time-dependent antibiotics; they exert their optimal bactericidal effect when drug concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the pathogen. A typical target is to maintain drug P-26: Hyperkeratosis of the footpads in a dog with pemphigus foliaceous. P-27: Erosive dermatitis on the footpads of a dog with pemphigus vulgaris. From Hnilica, K.A., Small Animal Dermatology: A Color Atlas and Therapeutic Guide, 4th ed, Elsevier, 2017. 830 pen \u0001P concentrations 24 times the MIC throughout the dosing interval. Unlike the concentration-dependent antibiotics, higher concentrations do not result in greater bactericidal activity, and there is little or no postantibiotic effect (PAE). There are four groups of penicillins: (1) the natural penicillins, penicillin G and penicillin V, have a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, mainly against gram-positive bacteria; (2) the aminopenicillins, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, and hetacillin, are semisynthetic derivatives that have a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms, but are susceptible to penicillinase; (3) penicillinase-resistant penicillins, which include cloxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and oxacillin; and (4) the extendedspectrum penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin), which are effective against gram-positive and gramnegative organisms (aerobes and anaerobes), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Allergic reaction to penicillin occurs with repeated exposure in some animals and ranges from urticaria to anaphylaxis, which may be fatal. (An acute systemic response, notably hyperactivity or panic, following inadvertent intravascular injection of procaine penicillin G in horses may occur with the first dose and is caused by procaine toxicity rather than penicillin allergy.) p. allergy degradation products of the penicillins act as haptens, binding to proteins and stimulating an immune response. p. G benzylpenicillin; the most widely used penicillin; used principally in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. Procaine penicillin G is a parenteral preparationonly for intra-muscular injectionthat can maintain therapeutic concentrations for 1224 hours; benzathine penicillin G is a very slow-release, parenteral preparation that maintains blood concentrations for several days but may not achieve therapeutic concentrations (24 times MIC for target pathogens) so it is best suited for prophylactic antibiotic therapy in relatively low-risk situations. p.-induced hemolytic anemia rare problem in horses that develop IgG anti-penicillin antibodies. phenoxymethyl p. a biosynthetically or semisynthetically produced antibiotic, similar to penicillin G; not affected by gastric acid so it is suitable for oral administration. Its antibacterial spectrum is the same as for penicillin G. Called also penicillin V. p. V see phenoxymethyl penicillin (above). penicillinase [pen-sil-ns] an enzyme produced by bacteria that inactivates penicillin by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring, thus increasing resistance to the antibiotic; a purified form from Bacillus cereus is used in the treatment of reactions to penicillin. penicilliosis [pen-sile-osis] infection by the blue-green mold, Penicillium; causes a necrotic rhinitis and sinusitis that occasionally extends to the mouth or orbit. The disease is similar to aspergillosis. Penicillium [pen-sile-m] a genus of mold-forming fungi in the phylum Ascomycota that grow on stored feed and in growing plants.

Can be poisonous if infested with the fungus Claviceps fusiformis, known to cause agalactia in sows. Called P. glaucum, also bulrush, Indian, horse, or pearl millet. P. ciliare a grass of the family Poaceae; called also Cenchrus ciliaris, buffel grass. Grazing of pure or near-pure swards of this pasture plant by horses can cause nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism because most of the calcium in the grass is in the form of oxalate crystals and unavailable for absorption. In very lush pasture, it can cause acute oxalate poisoning in sheep and cattle, but only if they are very hungry. P. clandestinum perennial, creeping grass with hairy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. Has a rapid summer growth period; suitable for green chop, silage or grazing. May have a low fiber content and cause depression of fat content of milk. A very valuable grass producing an enormous bulk of feed in suitable climates. It can be poisonous, causing so-called kikuyu poisoning of cattle, a high case-fatality ratio syndrome of salivation, dehydration, sham drinking, ruminal distention and stasis, staggering and a high-stepping gait, kidney dysfunction, rumen microvesication, and nephrosis. Various causes have been suggested, the currently most promising being wortmannin, a viridian-like furanosteroid mycotoxin produced by Fusarium torulosum. Trichothecene mycotoxins from Myrothecium spp. and Phoma herbarum growing on plant debris after a period of lush growth or infestation with army caterpillars is unlikely as the cause. P. clandestinum can also cause oxalate and nitrite poisoning. Called also Kikuyu grass. P. glaucum see Pennisetum americanum (above). P. polystachyon P. purpureum. Called also mission grass.

McCurnins Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians, 9th ed. Saunders, 2017. placenta 859 \u0001P vascularized parts. Called also afterbirth. See also fetal membranes, placentation. Domestic animals have a chorioallantoic placenta in which the outer layer of the allantois is fused with the chorion, and the fetal umbilical vessels are distributed in the connective tissue between the two. Placentae are classified in several ways; based on the tissues of the dam and the fetus that contact each other; based on the proportion of the surface area of the fetal membranes that is in fact placentacious; based on loss of tissue at birth, etc., Thus, the bovine placenta is epitheliochorial, cotyledonary, and nondeciduate. The major function of the placenta is to allow diffusion of nutrients from the dams blood into the fetuss blood and diffusion of waste products from the fetus back to the dam. This two-way exchange takes place across the placental membrane, which is semipermeable. The placenta also produces hormones such as progesterone and estrogen. adeciduate p. see epitheliochorial placenta (below). choriovitelline p. a placentation in which the yolk sac becomes involved in the fetalmaternal union. cotyledonary p. distribution of the villi on the fetal chorion is localized in multiple circumscribed areasthe cotyledons. diffuse p. the villi on the fetal chorion is diffuse over the entire placenta as in mares and sows. discoid p. a placenta in which the chorionic villi are arranged in a circular plate as in human and rodent placentae. endotheliochorial p. the maternal vessels in the endometrium are bared to their endothelium, and these are in contact with the chorion of the fetal membranes.

Called also adeciduate placenta. hemochorial p. a type of placenta in which all maternal layers are lost so that fetal tissue is in contact with frank maternal blood, as occurs in insectivores, rodents, rabbits, and most primates. nondeciduate p. no maternal tissue is lost when the pregnancy terminates. retained p. the placenta has not been passed within a certain time (cow 12 hours, sheep and goat 6 hours, mare 8 hours, camelid 3 hours) after the fetus has been delivered. Represents a potential beginning for metritis and infertility. Often difficult to assess in carnivores as they rapidly eat the placenta, but of less concern than in other species. Called also retained fetal membranes. syndesmochorial p. a type of placentation characterized by an endometrial attachment to the chorion with a limited amount of destruction of the endometrial epithelium.

See also placenta. p. calcification accumulations of mineral deposit especially around the vessels and in the allantois, a normal occurrence in most species. p. cavities the allantoic and amniotic cavities; called also amniotic and allantoic sac. p. edema edema of the placenta, without necessarily any involvement of the fetus. p. hormones the placenta in all species produces estrogens and progesterone. In the cow it also produces lactogen, a hormone that influences structural and functional aspects of milk production. In the mare, the endometrial cups produce PMSG (now called eCG) that assists in the maintenance of pregnancy. The canine, equine, feline, and primate placentae also produce relaxin that has a similar action. p. implantation the placenta of a viable fetus, escaped from the genital tract, can implant successfully to the peritoneum in some species. p. inflammation see placentitis. p. lactogen a placental hormone present in the cows peripheral circulation at about 160 days of pregnancy; thought to have prolactin and growth-hormone capabilities.

Blood platelets (called also thrombocytes) are disk-shaped, nonnucleated blood elements with a very fragile membrane; they tend to adhere to uneven or damaged surfaces. They average about 250,000 per cubic millimeter of blood and are formed in the red bone marrow by fragmentation of megakaryocytes, the largest of the bone marrow cells. Platelet production is controlled by a hormone, thrombopoietin, and regulatory lymphocytes acting at the stem cell level. At any given time, about one-third of the total blood platelets can be found in the spleen; the remaining two-thirds are in the circulating blood. The functions of platelets are related to the clotting of blood. Because of their adhesion and aggregation capabilities, platelets can occlude small breaks in blood vessels and prevent the escape of blood. Platelets that have adhered to exposed collagen in damaged vessels release ADP in milliseconds, which in turn initiates the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a very potent prostaglandin that causes platelet aggregation and localized vasoconstriction. Fibrinogen, factors V and VIII, calcium ions, platelet phospholipid (PF-3), associated with the platelet membrane are also released. Substances contained within the platelet granules such as thromboglobulin, heparin neutralizing activity (PF-4) mitogens such as platelet derived growth factor, thrombospondin, ADP, serotonin, and calcium ions are also released by aggregated platelets. p.-activating factor (PAF) see platelet-activating factor. p. adhesion the adherence of platelets to exposed subendothelium; the first step in component of hemostasis. p. aggregation the progressive accumulation of platelets, attracted by other platelets once adhesion begins.

The second part is the inscription, which specifies the ingredients and their quantities. The third part is the subscription, which tells the pharmacist in which form to compound or dispense the medicine. The signature is the last part, and it is usually preceded by an S or sig. to represent the Latin signa, meaning mark. The signature is where the veterinarian indicates what instructions are to be written on the outside of the package, in plain language, to tell the patients owner when and how to administer the medicine and in what doses. With medications a patient may require for prolonged periods without a change in dosage, the prescribing veterinarian may authorize a certain number of medication refills without further prescription; in such cases the number of refills is also specified on the prescription and on the medicine label. The pharmacist keeps a file of all the prescriptions he/she fills. p. drugs drugs limited in their availability by law so that a prescription is needed to obtain them.

Used therapeutically in the treatment of threatened abortion in some species, in estrus control in dogs, cats, and horses, and occasionally in treatment of some types of skin diseases. During the maturation of the ovum, estrogen, the principal female sex hormone, is produced at a high rate. At ovulation estrogen production is sharply reduced, and the follicle is replaced by the corpus luteum of which the main function is to produce progesterone. Unless fertilization takes place, the corpus luteum regresses. The progesterone produced by the corpus luteum is promptly carried by the blood to the uterus, as was the estrogen that preceded it. Both hormones now work to prepare the uterus for possible conception. In pregnancy, progesterone acts in a way that protects the embryo and fosters growth of the placenta. By decreasing the frequency of uterine contractions it helps to prevent expulsion of the implanted ovum. It also promotes secretory changes in the mucosa of the uterine tubes, thereby helping to provide nutrition for the fertilized ovum as it travels through the tube on its way to the uterus. Another function of progesterone is promotion of the development of the mammary glands in preparation for lactation. Prolactin, from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, stimulates production of the milk, and progesterone prepares the glands for secretion. p. assay the estimation of progesterone in milk or blood is used as a pregnancy test. blood p. the concentration of progesterone in the blood (progesteronemia); used as a means of early pregnancy diagnosis in cows and ewes. See also progesterone, pregnancy tests. p.-induced lactation see lactation induction. p. milk test assay of progesterone in milk used as a pregnancy test. p. plasma test the original pregnancy test that survives as the milk progesterone test; used in dogs as a guide in predicting the time of ovulation. p. releasing intravaginal device (PRID) used as a means of synchronizing estrus in cows and sheep as an aid to structured artificial insemination programs. progestin [pro-jestin] originally, the crude hormone of the corpus luteum; it has since been isolated in pure form and is now known as progesterone.

Clinical signs include chronic cough, loud abnormal breath sounds, a double expiratory effort, and abundant mucopurulent material in the trachea on endoscopic examination. Called also asthma, heaves broken wind. p. circulation the circulation of blood to and from the lungs. Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle flows through the right and left pulmonary arteries to the right and left lung. After entering the lungs, the branches subdivide, finally emerging as capillaries that surround the alveoli and release the carbon dioxide in exchange for oxygen. The capillaries unite gradually and assume the characteristics of veins. These veins join to form the pulmonary veins, which return the oxygenated blood to the left atrium. See also circulatory system. p. compliance a measure of the ability of the lung to distend in response to pressure without disruption.

Simple, uncomplicated embolism produces such cardiopulmonary signs as dyspnea, tachypnea, persistent cough, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis. On rare occasions, the cardiopulmonary signs may be acute, occurring suddenly and quickly producing cyanosis and shock. A septic embolus can lead to local pulmonary abscess or an extension to pneumonia as in caudal vena caval syndrome.

Called also immunoblast. pyrophosphatase [piro-fosf-ts] any enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate linkages, so that one phosphoryl group remains on each of the two products. inorganic p. an enzyme that splits pyrophosphate into two phosphate ions. pyrophosphate [piro-fosft] any salt of pyrophosphoric (diphosphoric) acid. pyrophosphoric acid [piro-fos-forik] a dimer of phosphoric acid, H4P2O7. Called also diphosphoric acid. pyrotic [pi-rotik] caustic; burning. pyroxylin [pi-roks-lin] a product of the action of a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids on cotton, consisting chiefly of cellulose tetranitrate; a necessary ingredient of collodion. pyrrole [prol] a basic, heterocyclic substance with a nitrogen-containing 5-membered ring, obtained by destructive distillation of various animal substances. Critical components in the synthesis of porphyrins. pyrrolic metabolites [p-rolk m-tabo-lts] highly reactive products of hepatic enzymic metabolism of ingested pyrrolizidine alkaloids from plants that bind to cell macromolecules and lead to cell damage. These metabolites persist for long periods in liver and have been used as the basis for diganosis of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis. pyrrolidine [p-rol-din] a simple base obtained from tobacco or prepared from pyrrole. Called also tetrahydropyrrole. pyrrolizidine [p-ro-liz-dn] a specific chemical configuration that is common to a number of naturally occurring compounds called the pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Common plant sources are in the genera Crotalaria, Echium, Heliotropium, Senecio. p. alkaloidosis the disease caused by poisoning with pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The hepatic lesion tends to be chronic and is characterized by necrosis, megalocytosis of hepatocytes due to inhibition of mitosis, biliary ductular, proliferation, vasculitis, and perivenous fibrosis. Lesions are most severe in the liver and result in various clinical signs including jaundice, photosensitization, and hepatic encephalopathy, and sometimes hemolysis. Some alkaloids cause lung damage characterized by edema, fibrosis, alveolar epithelialization, and emphysema, e.g., jaagsiekte. Megalocytosis also occurs in the kidney, and there may be extensive nephrosis. Carcinogenesis is a feature in laboratory animals. An incidental pathogenesis is a concurrent chronic copper poisoning causing the disease toxemic jaundice. p. alkaloids alkaloids produced by plants, about half of which are toxic. Toxic alkaloids are usually esters of retronecine or heliotridine and have known specific structural features. Toxic examples include senecionine, jacobine, monocrotaline, spectabiline, heliotrine and lasiocarpine. They often occur in plants as the less toxic N-oxide forms. These can be converted to the toxic free bases by intestinal microbes or liver enzymes. Cause pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis (see above). Common plant sources are in the genera Crotalaria, Echium, Heliotropium, Senecio. See also pyrrolic metabolites. Pyrus malus see Malus sylvestris. pyruvate [piroo-vt] a salt, ester or anion of pyruvic acid. The term is used interchangeably with pyruvic acid. Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and may be metabolized in the body anerobically to lactate or after transport into mitochondria to acetyl CoA. In yeast it is metabolized to ethanol. p. carboxylase an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetic acid and has a regulatory role in gluconeogenesis. p. dehydrogenase an enzyme actively concerned in the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and CO2. A component enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. p. dehydrogenase complex complex consisting of three enzymes responsible for the conversion of pyruate into acetyl CoA in a decarboxylation reaction. Requires the co-factors thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoic acid, NAD+ , and FAD. p. dehydrogenase phosphatase deficiency an inherited autosomal recessive trait in Clumber and Sussex spaniel dogs; one of the mitochondrial myopathies. A null mutation in pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 results in exercise intolerance and post-exercise collapse in affected dogs. p. kinase (PK) a glycolytic pathway enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP by the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP. A deficiency of the enzyme is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in humans and occurs also in Beagles, Basenjis, and West Highland white terriers and causes a nonspherocytic anemia. It also occurs as an autosomal recessive trait in Abyssinian, Somali, and some domestic shorthair cats. p. transaminase see alanine aminotransferase. pyruvic acid [pi-roovik] a compound formed in the body in metabolism of carbohydrate; also formed by dry distillation of tartaric acid. Used synonymously with pyruvate. pyruvic kinase see pyruvate kinase. pythiosis [pithe-osis] infection by Pythium insidiosum; an uncommon disease of cattle, horses, companion animals, and humans. Occurs most often in the southern US, but has been reported from many other countries in regions with similar climatic conditions and opportunities for exposure to standing water. Usually ulcerative and granulomatous cutaneous lesions that do not invade adjacent muscular tissues, but occasionally occurs as systemic disease. Called also equine espundia in Colombia. canine p. most often occurs in large breed dogs as either a gastrointestinal or cutaneous infection, depending on the method of exposure. In the gastrointestinal form, there is a severe, segmental granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenopathy with chronic diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and depression. In cutaneous and subcutaneous pythiosis, there are single or multiple ulcerated and draining nodules and masses. equine p. see swamp cancer. Pythium insidiosum [pithe-m] previously called Hyphomyces destruens, obsolete synonym P. destruens; the cause of pythiosis in dogs, cattle, and horses. Previously classified as fungus, but now regarded as one of the oomycetes, members of a separate kingdom, either Stramenopila or Chromista. Disease in horses is also referred to as swamp cancer. python non venomous snakes of the family Pythonidae, native to Africa, Australia, and Asia. Most are large, with a distinct neck. Common as pets. 922 pyridoxamine \u0001P ball p. constricting snake (Python regius), ranging from 4 to 6 ft long; popular as pets because of their manageable size and docile nature. Curling up into a ball with the head buried in the middle is typical defensive behavior and the source of the name. Called also royal python. Burmese p. a very large snake (averaging 1012 ft in length), popular in the pet trade. Has escaped in Florida and is becoming a major pest carpet p. (Morelia spp.) a medium-sized, non-venomous, arboreal snake native to Australia and New Guinea; very popular as pets. Various subspecies exist, inlcuding the diamond python (M. spilota spilota). children's p. (Antaresia childreni) a small, non-venomous python native to northern Australia; adaptable to captivity, they generally have a placid nature, and their small size makes them popular as pets. A nocturnal species, named after zoologist John Children, not because they are kept by children. diamond p. (Morela spilota spilota) a medium-sized snake, native to Australia and New Guinea, with distinctive yellow and black, diamondshaped markings. Called also diamond snake. royal p. see ball python (above). pyuria [pi-ure-] white blood cells (pus) in the urine. PZI protamine zinc insulin. pyrazinamide [pir-zin-md] an antibacterial agent used for the oral treatment of tuberculosis in humans. Also used in a biochemical test for the identification of mycobacteria. pyrazinamide 923 \u0001P\n"
