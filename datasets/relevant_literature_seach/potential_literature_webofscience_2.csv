Previous observations on the effect of ablation or inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) on the responses of neurons within the second somatosensory area(SII) to tactile stimuli point to profound differences between monkeys and certain other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems. In the cat, for example, tactile information appears to be conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII, whereas, in macaque and marmoset monkeys, it is conveyed in a serial (or hierarchical) scheme from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII. The present study examined the responses of individual SII neurons during reversible, cooling-induced inactivation of SI in another nonprimate placental mammal, the rabbit, to obtain further evidence on whether the above differences might reflect a fundamental distinction between simian primates and other mammalian species. 2. When the temperature at the face of a silver cooling block over the forepaw and hindpaw regions of SI was lowered to 5-13-degrees-C, the SI surface potentials evoked by brief tactile stimuli were abolished (indicative of SI inactivation), whereas SII potentials remained intact. 3. The responses of 25 SII neurons to controlled tactile stimuli (consisting of 1- to 1.5-s trains of vibration or rectangular mechanical pulses) were studied before, during, and after inactivation of SI. The effects on the spontaneous activity of a further three SII neurons that lacked identified receptive fields were also studied. 4. The response or activity levels of 26 of the 28 SII neurons examined (93%) were unaffected by SI inactivation. Furthermore, the temporal precision of responses at a particular phase of the repetitive mechanical stimuli also appeared to be unaffected by SI inactivation. The 28 neurons studied were located at different depths of the SII cortex and represented different functional classes, which included dynamically sensitive tactile neurons activated from glabrous or hairy skin by 5- to 10-Hz trains of mechanical stimuli and two neurons activated by high-frequency (300 Hz) cutaneous vibration, whose input appeared to come from pacinian corpuscles. 5. Only 2 of the 28 SII neurons exhibited a reduction in response to cutaneous stimuli during SI inactivation. However, because there was some evidence for a reduction in spontaneous activity in those neurons during SI inactivation, SI may exert a background facilitatory influence on the responsiveness of some SII neurons. 6. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that, in the rabbit, tactile information conveyed to SII is not dependent on an intracortical serially organized path through SI. Rather, the observations indicate that, in the rabbit, as in the cat, SI and SII are organized in parallel for the processing of information from the thalamus. These observations contrast with those in monkeys, where tactile processing is organized in a serial scheme, and support the hypothesis that there is a fundamental difference between simian primates and other mammals in the functional organization of thalamocortical tactile systems.","UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY 2033,AUSTRALIA","University of New South Wales Sydney",,,"Murray, Grainne/AAK-1591-2021","Murray, Grainne/0000-0003-0741-9288; Campbell, Douglas/0000-0001-9699-1854",,,,,29,28,28,0,0,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a number of modules, which seem to provide multiple subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical connections in subhuman primates. There may be a gnat degree of convergence of the limbic, associative and motor loops at the level of the striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic input directly as well as indirectly through the striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to behavioral learning by signaling motivation and reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be involved in behavioral state control, learning and reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections as well as the deep cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas, have very dense corticocotrical connections with other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents from the parietal and temporal cortices, and integrated information, via multiple routes, from the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi are linked directly to these areas by ways of the oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and the Ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), respectively. These connections are thought to be involved in the acquisition and coordination of motor sequences. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two specific retinothalamic projections to area MT have been speculated to relay through the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar nucleus (PIm) and the koniocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although a number of studies have demonstrated retinal inputs to regions of the thalamus where relays to area MT have been observed, the relationship between the retinal terminals and area MT relay cells has not been established. Here we examined direct retino-recipient regions of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) pulvinar nucleus and the LGN following binocular injections of anterograde tracer, as well as area MT relay cells in these nuclei by injection of retrograde tracer into area MT. Retinal afferents were shown to synapse with area MT relay cells as demonstrated by colocalization with the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin. We also established the presence of direct synapes of retinal afferents on area MT relay cells within the PIm, as well as the koniocellular K1 and K3 layers of the LGN, thereby corroborating the existence of two disynaptic pathways from the retina to area MT that bypass V1.","[Warner, Claire E.; Goldshmit, Yona; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Warner, Claire E.] Monash Univ, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Monash University; Monash University","Bourne, JA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Level 1 N,Bldg 75,STRIP 1, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.","james.bourne@armi.monash.edu.au","Bourne, James/B-5265-2018","Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108","National Health and Medical Research Council [436620]","National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","The authors would like to thank Prof. Paul Martin, Dr Tobias Merson and Rowan Tweedale for making many suggestions that improved this manuscript, Robert Bryson-Richardson for assistance with confocal microscopy and the facilities, scientific and technical assistance of Monash Micro Imaging, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.

T2-weighted MRI in patients with senile-onset showed symmetric high-signal lesions in the cerebral white matter, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and pens. However, MRI in younger patients revealed no such lesions and CT failed to demonstrate lesions in the globus pallidus and brain stem.

Experiments were carried out on three awake macaque monkeys. Animals sat in a primate chair in front of a large screen, and fixated a small spot of light projected in different screen locations while the activity of single neurons was extracellularly recorded. Both visual and non-visual neurons were found. About 48% of visual and 32% of non-visual neurons showed eye position-related activity in total darkness, while in similar to 61% of visual neurons the visual response was modulated by eye position in the orbit. Eye position fields and/or gain fields were different from cell to cell, going from large and quite planar fields up to peak-shaped fields localized in more or less restricted regions of the animal's field of view, The spatial distribution of fixation point locations evoking peak activity in the eye position-sensitive population did not show any evident laterality effect, or significant top/bottom asymmetry. Moreover, the cortical distribution of eye position-sensitive neurons was quite uniform all over the cortical region studied, suggesting the absence of segregation for this property within area PO (V6). In the great majority of visual neurons, the receptive field 'moved' with gaze according to eye displacements, remaining at the same retinotopic coordinates, as is usual for visual neurons. In some cases, the receptive field did not move with gaze, remaining anchored to the same spatial location regardless of eye movements ('real-position cells'). A model is proposed suggesting how eye position-sensitive visual neurons might build up real-position cells in local networks within area PO (V6). The presence in area PO (V6) of real-position cells together with a high percentage of eye position-sensitive neurons, most of them visual in nature, suggests that this cortical area is engaged in the spatial encoding of extrapersonal visual space. Since lesions of the superior parietal lobule in humans produce deficits in visual localization of targets as well as in arm-reaching for them, and taking into account that the monkey's area PO (V6) is reported to be connected with the premotor area 6, we suggest that area PO (V6) supplies the premotor cortex with the visuo-spatial information required for the visual control of arm-reaching movements.","UNIV TRIESTE, IST FISIOL, TRIESTE, ITALY","University of Trieste","Galletti, C (corresponding author), UNIV BOLOGNA, IST FISIOL UMANA, CATTEDRA FISIOL GEN, PIAZZA PORTA S DONATO 2, I-40127 BOLOGNA, ITALY.",,"Fattori, Patrizia/Q-8947-2017","Fattori, Patrizia/0000-0002-0079-3755; Battaglini, Piero Paolo/0000-0003-4697-8648; GALLETTI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8927-3408",,,,,50,226,228,0,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

[I-125]iodoMLA bound throughout the brain with the greatest density in the thalamus and moderate intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical regions. The Kd and Bmax in whole brain tissue were similar whether 1 mM nicotine (Kd 33.25 +/- 15.17 nM, Bmax 5.80 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) or 2 mu M of the alpha 7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (Kd 46.12 +/- 18.45 nM, Bmax 6.30 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) was used for nonspecific binding. The subtype-selectivity of this ligand was further studied with competition binding studies using nicotine, alpha-bungarotoxin and noniodinated MLA. Each ligand completely inhibited [I-125]iodoMLA binding throughout the monkey brain, with Ki values of 2.23 +/- 0.85 mu M for nicotine, 2.72 +/- 1.71 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin and 1.83 +/- 0.35 nM MLA in the caudate and 2.03 +/- 1.14 mu M, 2.65 +/- 0.86 nM and 3.32 +/- 0.71 nM, respectively, in the putamen. The alpha 3 beta 2/alpha 6*-selective antagonist alpha-conotoxin MII failed to inhibit [I-125]iodoMLA binding in any brain region. In monkeys with cognitive deficits resulting from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration, [I-125]iodoMLA binding was significantly increased in the striatum, similar to results previously observed for [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, [I-125]iodoMLA was selective for alpha 7-containing nAChRs and did not bind to alpha 6-containing nAChRs. This radioligand may be a useful tool for selectively imaging alpha 7-containing nAChRs in vivo.","Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; Res Triangle Inst, Ctr Organ & Med Chem, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA","Jefferson University; Research Triangle Institute","Kulak, JM (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Dept Pathol Anat & Cell Biol, 1020 Locust St,521 JAH, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.","jennifer.kulak@jefferson.edu",,,"NIDA NIH HHS [DA12001, DA13452] Funding Source: Medline; PHS HHS [MS43079] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,36,21,21,0,1,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Less is known about the long-term neurobiological impact of ELS. We used [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) to assess neural responses to a moderate stress test in adult monkeys that experienced ELS as infants. Both groups of monkeys showed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress-induced activations and cardiac arousal in response to the stressor. A whole brain analysis detected significantly greater regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in superior temporal sulcus, putamen, thalamus, and inferotemporal cortex of ELS animals compared to controls. Region of interest (ROI) analyses performed in areas identified as vulnerable to ELS showed greater activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of ELS compared to control monkeys, but greater hippocampal activity in the control compared to ELS monkeys. Together, these results suggest hyperactivity in emotional and sensory processing regions of adult monkeys with ELS, and greater activity in stress-regulatory areas in the controls. Despite these neural responses, no group differences were detected in neuroendocrine, autonomic or behavioral responses, except for a trend towards increased stillness in the ELS monkeys. Together, these data suggest hypervigilance in the ELS monkeys in the absence of immediate danger. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro.

A 5% decrease in caudate (Cd) nucleus volume is the most consistent structural finding in the brain of patients with Tourette syndrome (TS), but the cellular abnormalities that underlie this decrease in volume are unclear. In this study the density of different types of interneurons and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum was assessed in the postmortem brains of 5 TS subjects as compared with normal controls (NC) by unbiased stereological analyses. TS patients demonstrated a 50%-60% decrease of both parvalbumin (PV)+ and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ cholinergic interneurons in the Cd and the putamen (Pt). Cholinergic interneurons were decreased in TS patients in the associative and sensorimotor regions but not in the limbic regions of the striatum, such that the normal gradient in density of cholinergic cells (highest in associative regions, intermediate in sensorimotor and lowest in limbic regions) was abolished. No significant difference was present in the densities of medium-sized calretinin (CR)+ interneurons, MSNs, and total neurons. The selective deficit of PV+ and cholinergic striatal interneurons in TS subjects may result in an impaired cortico/thalamic control of striatal neuron firing in TS. J. Comp.

Early-enucleated fetuses (operated prior to embryonic day 77) showed morphological changes at the level of the thalamus and the cortex. In the thalamus, there was a loss of lamination and a decrease in size of the lateral geniculate nucleus. There was a decrease in the size of the inferior pulvinar, but there was no change in the lateral pulvinar. The border of striate cortex was as sharp in the enucleates as it was in the normal monkeys. In three of the four early enucleates, we observed an interdigitation of striate and extrastriate cortex. In three of the early enucleates, we observed a small island of nonstriate cortex near the striate border that was surrounded entirely by striate cortex. Enucleation led to an age-related reduction of striate cortex. This reduction was greater in the operculum than in the calcarine fissure. The reduction of striate cortex was accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of extrastriate visual cortex, so that the overall dimensions of the neocortex remained invariant. The extrastriate cortex in the enucleated animals presented a uniform cytoarchitecture and was indistinguishable from area 18 in the normal animal. There were changes in the gyral pattern that were restricted mainly to the cortex on the operculum. A deepening of minor dimples as well as the induction of a variable number of supplementary sulci led to an increase in the convolution of the occipital lobe. These results are discussed with respect to the specification of cortical areas. They demonstrate that the reduction in striate cortex was not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the neocortex; rather, there was a border shift, and a large volume of cor tex that was destined to become striate cortex appears to be cytoarchitectonically normal extrastriate cortex.

For example, the supplementary motor area (SMA) is mainly involved in internally-triggered movements, whereas the premotor cortex (PM) is highly responsible for externally-guided movements. The primary motor cortex (M1) deals with both aspects of movements to execute a single motor behavior. To elucidate how the cortical motor system is structured to process a variety of information, the laminar distribution patterns of signals were examined between SMA and M1, or PM and M1 in macaque monkeys by using dual anterograde tract-tracing. Dense terminal labeling was observed in layers 1 and upper 2/3 of M1 after one tracer injection into SMA, another tracer injection into the dorsal division of PM resulted in prominent labeling in the deeper portion of layer 2/3. Weaker labeling was also visible in layer 5 in both cases. On the other hand, inputs from M1 terminated in both the superficial and the deep layers of SMA and PM. The present data indicate that distinct types of motor information are arranged in M1 in a layer-specific fashion to be orchestrated through a microcircuit within M1.","[Ninomiya, Taihei; Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Ninomiya, Taihei; Hoshi, Eiji; Takada, Masahiko] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Ninomiya, Taihei] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Hoshi, Eiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Frontal Lobe Funct Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan","Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science","Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan.;Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Tokyo 1020076, Japan.;Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","ninomiya@nips.ac.jp","Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015","Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280","Cooperation Research Program of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University [2015-A-7]; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [16gm0310008h0206]","Cooperation Research Program of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST))","We thank T Kuroda and K Nagaya for technical assistance.

Recent findings indicate that prefrontal pathways interface with laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices, terminate extensively in the frontal and sensory sectors of the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus, and target the inhibitory intercalated masses of the amygdala. Circuit-based models suggest that prefrontal pathways can select relevant signals and efficiently suppress distractors, in processes that are disrupted in schizophrenia and in other disorders affecting prefrontal cortices.","Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbasc@bu.edu","Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012; anand, amit/A-7222-2009","Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832; Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104","NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH057414-05, R01 MH057414] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS024760, R01 NS024760-18] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,69,119,120,0,22,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1073-8584","1089-4098",,"NEUROSCIENTIST","Neuroscientist","OCT",2007,13,5,,,,,532,545,,"10.1177/1073858407301369","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1073858407301369"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1073858407301369"")",,,14,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","214UI",17901261,"Green Accepted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000249763300019","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000249763300019"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In one subgroup (E, type 1), axons have an elongated terminal field and thin, spinous terminations; in the other (R, type 2), axons have a small, round arbor and large, beaded terminations. Previous work (Rockland, 1996) indicates that E-type axons from several occipitotemporal areas branch extensively within and sometimes between pulvinar subdivisions, but that R-type axons tend to have spatially delimited arbors. The present report is a further investigation of R-type axons from areas VI and MT and was initiated to test the generality of the previous findings. There are four :main results: 1) By serial section reconstruction of anterogradely labeled axons, 10 of 25 axons originating in area V1 had two or three spatially separate arbors (8 and 2 axons, respectively). Sixteen axons analyzed from area MT, however, all had single arbors, although the arbors were often formed by the convergence of widely separate branches. 2) Multiple (at least 2-5) R-type corticopulvinar axons, from V1 or from MT, can converge in a single focus. 3) R-type axons originating from both areas V1 and MT can branch to other structures; namely, the superior colliculus, the pretectal area, and/or the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. 4) Finally, corticopulvinar terminations from area V1 are predominantly R-type, whereas those from MT are more predominantly E-type. These results thus provide additional evidence of the special relationship of area V1 to the pulvinar. They also emphasize that the idea of corticopulvinocortical feedback loops, although convenient as a shorthand nomenclature, does not adequately convey the full complexity of the system.

In addition, two modifications were identified that resulted in robust and reliable retrograde transport and EGFP expression after injection of the virus into three different brain regions in adult rats (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior thalamic nuclear group, and CA1). These are post-injection survival times of 14 days and addition of high concentrations of NaCl (>= 600 mM) to the injection buffer. These modifications resulted in obvious improvement in the intensity of the EGFP signal and in the number of labeled cells. Use of anti-EGFP in immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase processing further enhanced the signal so that Golgi-like filling of dendritic spines and axon collaterals was routinely achieved. Effectiveness of the AdSynEGFP for Golgi-like filling was confirmed in one rhesus monkey with injections in visual area V4. Because of the long-term viability of the infected neurons (at least up to 28 days in rats and 22 days in monkey), this AdSynEGFP is suitable for use in microcircuitry studies in combination with other fluorescently tagged elements, including anterogradely labeled extrinsic projections. The native EGFP signal (without antibody enhancement) may be sufficient for studies involving cultured cells or slices.","RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","RIKEN","Tomioka, R (corresponding author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.","rtomioka@brain.riken.jp",,"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785",,,,,47,33,38,0,3,"HISTOCHEMICAL SOC INC","SEATTLE","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT BIOSTRUCTURE, BOX 357420, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA","0022-1554",,,"J HISTOCHEM CYTOCHEM","J.

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] deoxyglucose to compare the brain metabolic responses ( marker of brain function) of cocaine-addicted subjects (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) to identify brain regions that are uniquely activated in addicted subjects by intravenous methylphenidate ( a drug that cocaine-addicted subjects report to be similar to cocaine). In parallel, we also measured the changes in dopamine (DA) induced by intravenous methylphenidate (using PET and [C-11] raclopride) in the striatum and in the thalamus. Metabolic responses between groups differed significantly only in the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 25 and medial BA 11], where methylphenidate increased metabolism in addicted subjects but decreased metabolism in controls. These changes were associated in all subjects with increased desire for methylphenidate and in the addicted subjects with cocaine craving. In addicted subjects, increases in BA 25 were also associated with mood elevation. Methylphenidate-induced increases in metabolism in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex were associated with its increase of DA in the thalamus but not in the striatum. These findings provide evidence that enhanced sensitivity of BA 25 (region involved with emotional reactivity) and BA 11 (region involved with salience attribution and motivation) in cocaine-addicted subjects may underlie the strong emotional response to the drug and the intense desire to procure it that results in craving and compulsive drug intake. It also suggests that the mesothalamic DA pathway may contribute to these processes.","NIDA, Rockville, MD 20857 USA; NIAAA, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Med, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Chem, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Behav Sci, Portland, OR 97201 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Child Dev Ctr, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29465 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Oregon Health & Science University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Medical University of South Carolina","Volkow, ND (corresponding author), NIDA, 6001 Execut Blvd,Room 5274, Rockville, MD 20857 USA.","nvolkow@nida.nih.gov",,,"NIDA NIH HHS [R01DA06891, R01 DA006891] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA))",,,72,237,243,1,15,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The MD projection to PFC terminates largely in layer IV with lighter innervation of layers II, III, V, and VI. The cells projecting back to MD are mostly in layer VI. The parvocellular component of MD projects to and receives projections from the more caudal and dorsomedial component of the PFC, whereas the magnocellular portion of MD projects to and receives projections from the more rostral and lateral component of the PFC.

The goal of the present study was to establish in monkeys whether these subdivisions also differ with regard to their callosal connectivity. Two fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected in each animal, one in the pre-SMA and the second in the SMA-proper. Tracer injections in the pre-SMA or in SMA-proper resulted in significant numbers of labeled neurons in the opposite SMA, premotor cortex (PM), cingulate motor areas (CMA), and cingulate gyrus. Labeled neurons in M1 were rare, being observed only after injection in the SMA-proper. The two subdivisions of the SMA differed in the proportion of labeled neurons found across areas providing their callosal inputs. The SMA-proper receives about half of its callosal inputs from its counterpart in the other hemisphere (42-65% across monkeys). A comparable proportion of neurons was found in the pre-SMA after injection in the opposite pre-SMA (32-47%). The pre-SMA receives more callosal inputs from the rostral halves of the dorsal PM, the ventral PM, and the CMA than from their caudal halves. In addition, the pre-SMA, but not the SMA-proper, receives callosal inputs from the prefrontal cortex. The SMA-proper receives more callosal inputs from the caudal halves of the, dorsal PM and ventral PM than from their rostral halves. The two subdivisions of the SMA receive callosal inputs from the same cortical areas except the prefrontal cortex and M1), but they differ with respect to the quantitative contribution of each area of origin. In conclusion, quantitative data now support the notion that pre-SMA receives more transcallosal inputs than the SMA-proper.J.Comp.Neurol.443:71-85,2002.

Although primates share many similarities in the organization of their visual centers with other mammals, and even other species of vertebrates, their visual pathways also show unique features, particularly with respect to the organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in order to understand some aspects of human visual function, we need to study non-human primate brains. Which species is the most appropriate model? Macaque monkeys, the most widely used non-human primates, are not an optimal choice in many practical respects. For example, much of the macaque cerebral cortex is buried within sulci, and is therefore inaccessible to many imaging techniques, and the postnatal development and lifespan of macaques are prohibitively long for many studies of brain maturation, plasticity, and aging. In these and several other respects the marmoset, a small New World monkey, represents a more appropriate choice. Here we review the visual pathways of the marmoset, highlighting recent work that brings these advantages into focus, and identify where additional work needs to be done to link marmoset brain organization to that of macaques and humans. We will argue that the marmoset monkey provides a good subject for studies of a complex visual system, which will likely allow an important bridge linking experiments in animal models to humans.","[Solomon, Samuel G.] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, London WC1P 0AH, England; [Rosa, Marcello G.

A well established primate model of parkinsonism was used. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak dose dyskinesia. Thalamotomy was carried out using a radiofrequency electrode. To ensure that the appropriate area of the thalamus was targeted, that is the area receiving the pallidal input, an anatomical tracing study was carried out. The anterograde anatomical tracer horseradish peroxidase, covalently bound to wheatgerm agglutinin, was injected into the medical segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three monkeys. The target site for thalamotomy was accurately worked out from the tracings obtained. Chorea was usually abolished and always reduced by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies: 4 animals receiving bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations, and 2 animals undergoing unilateral surgery. Lesions in three control sites were carried out and had no permanent effect on chorea. The effect of lesions in other areas was also assessed. Dystonia was not relieved by any thalamic lesion. Thalamotomy is a long established procedure used to help parkinsonian tremor. Appropriately placed thalamotomy should be considered for the relief of disabling peak dose dyskinesia, which is predominantly choreic, in parkinsonian patients on otherwise successful levodopa therapy.",,,"PAGE, RD (corresponding author), WALTON HOSP, DEPT NEUROSURG, RICE LANE, LIVERPOOL L9 1AE, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,173,36,36,0,0,"SPRINGER WIEN","WIEN","SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA","0001-6268","0942-0940",,"ACTA NEUROCHIR","Acta Neurochir.",,1992,114,"3-4",,,,,77,117,,"10.1007/BF01400598","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01400598"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01400598"")",,,41,"Clinical Neurology; Surgery","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery","HH837",1580197,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1992HH83700001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1992HH83700001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

To expand on this knowledge, we assessed the synaptic properties of excitatory projections from the primary to secondary auditory cortex and vice versa. We identified 2 types of postsynaptic responses. The first class of responses have larger initial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), exhibit paired-pulse depression, are limited to ionotropic glutamate receptor activation, and have larger synaptic terminals; the second has smaller initial EPSPs, paired-pulse facilitation, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, and smaller synaptic terminals. These responses are similar to the driver and modulator properties previously identified for thalamic and thalamocortical circuitry, suggesting that the same classification may extend to corticocortical inputs and have an implication for the functional organization of corticocortical circuits.","[Covic, Elise N.; Sherman, S.

We have previously shown that within the early weeks and months following one of these lesions, there is 1) a re-emergence of part or all of the cortical hand map; 2) central axonal sprouting of spared primary afferents into the dorsal horn and cuneate nucleus; and 3) substantial although incomplete recovery of hand function (Darian-Smith [2041 J. Comp. Neurol. 470:134-150; Darian-Smith and Ciferri [20051 J. Comp. Neurol. 491:27-45). In this study we asked: What neuronal reorganization occurs in the cuneate nucleus during this recovery period? And, does it contribute to the recovery of manual dexterity? To address these questions, the representation of the hand was electrophysiologically mapped (by unitary receptive field [RF] recordings) in the pars rotunda of the cuneate nucleus at either 1-2 weeks (short term) or 16-32 weeks (long term) post-rhizotomy. In short-term monkeys, the region deprived of input from the thumb, index, and middle finger was found to be unresponsive to cutaneous stimulation. However, at 16-32 weeks later, when dexterity had largely recovered, RFs of cuneate neurons could again be mapped within the cuneate nucleus, primarily in a region bordering the deprived zone. We conclude that the cuneate pre- and postsynaptic reorganization that occurs following dorsal rhizotomy plays a key role in the recovery of hand function.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University","Darian-Smith, C (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, 300 Pasteur Dr,Edwards Bldg,Room R106, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","cdarian@stanford.edu",,"Darian-Smith, Corinna/0000-0002-4753-4574","NINDS NIH HHS [R01- NS048425-01A1] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,39,25,25,0,0,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

Due to the putative importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in symptomatology, fibers that connect the OFC, SCT lesion, and either the thalamus or brainstem were investigated with two-tensor tractography using an unscented Kalman filter approach. From this dataset, fibers were warped to Montreal Neurological Institute space, and probability maps with center-of-mass analysis were subsequently generated. In comparing fibers from the same OFC region, including medial OFC (mOFC), central OFC (cOFC), and lateral OFC (lOFC), the area of divergence for fibers connected with the thalamus versus the brainstem is posterior to the anterior commissure. At the anterior commissure, fibers connected with the thalamus run dorsal to those connected with the brainstem. As OFC fibers travel through the ventral aspect of the internal capsule, lOFC fibers are dorsal to cOFC and mOFC fibers. Using neuroanatomical comparison, tracts coursing between the OFC and thalamus are likely part of the anterior thalamic radiations, while those between the OFC and brainstem likely belong to the medial forebrain bundle. These data support the involvement of the OFC in OCD and may be relevant to creating differential lesional procedures of specific tracts or to developing deep brain stimulation programming paradigms.","[Papadimitriou, George; Liang, Lichen; Makris, Nikos] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Papadimitriou, George; Liang, Lichen; Makris, Nikos] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yang, Jimmy C.; Eskandar, Emad N.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Dougherty, Darin D.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Eckbo, Ryan; Bouix, Sylvain; Rathi, Yogesh; Shenton, Martha; Kubicki, Marek] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Psychiat Neuroimaging Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yang, Jimmy C.; Dougherty, Darin D.; Bouix, Sylvain; Rathi, Yogesh; Shenton, Martha; Kubicki, Marek; Eskandar, Emad N.; Makris, Nikos] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Yeterian, Edward H.] Colby Coll, Dept Psychol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Shenton, Martha] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Brockton, MA USA","Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Colby College; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Harvard University; VA Boston Healthcare System","Makris, N (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA.","nikos@cma.mgh.harvard.edu","Dougherty, Darin D./G-9896-2012; Shenton, Martha/V-8780-2019","Bouix, Sylvain/0000-0003-1326-6054"," [R01DA027804];  [R21EB016449]","; ","R01DA027804 (NM), R21EB016449 (NM)",,72,5,5,0,9,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1931-7557","1931-7565",,"BRAIN IMAGING BEHAV","Brain Imaging Behav.","JUN",2015,9,2,,,,,342,352,,"10.1007/s11682-014-9314-z","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-014-9314-z"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-014-9314-z"")",,,11,"Neuroimaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","CI7TB",25103312,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000354966600019","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000354966600019"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

A previous functional neuroimaging study failed to find clear effects of clonidine (alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist) on activity of brain regions implicated in attention. Therefore, we now investigate whether clonidine affects the functional integration of a neuroanatomical attentional network, by modulating connectivity between brain regions rather than activity within discrete regions. Following infusion of either clonidine or placebo, positron emission tomography measurements of brain activity were collected in 13 normal subjects while they were either resting or performing an attentional task. Effective connectivity analysis showed that during rest, clonidine decreased the functional strength of connections both from frontal cortex to thalamus and in pathways to and from visual cortex. Conversely, during the attentional task, functional integration generally increased, with changes being centered on parietal cortex (increased connectivity from locus coeruleus to parietal cortex and from parietal cortex to thalamus and frontal cortex). A drug-induced increase in the modulatory effects of frontal cortex on projections from locus coeruleus to parietal cortex was also observed. Collectively, these results highlight cognitively dissociable effects of clonidine on interactions among functionally integrated brain regions and implicate the noradrenergic system in mediating the functional integration of attentional brain systems. The context-sensitive nature of the changes are consistent with observations that noradrenergic drugs have differential effects on brain processes depending on subjects' underlying arousal levels. More generally, the results illustrate the dynamic plasticity of cognitive brain systems following neurochemical challenge.

The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-median/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi. This type of information should be taken into account when interpreting data from deep brain stimulation applied to pallidal and subthalamic regions in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple-injection PET experimental protocols with injections of radiolabeled and unlabeled doses of fallypride Were used to estimate the K-1, k(2), k(on)/V-R, k(off) and B-max' kinetic parameters. The experimental design was chosen using the D-optimal criterion to maximize the precision of the estimated binding parameters for the various brain regions. There was a significant range in B-max' for the putamen (27pmol/mL), caudate (23pmol/mL), ventral striatum (14pmol/mL), thalamus (1.8pmol/mL) and amygdala (0.9pmol/mL). Significant receptor binding was also found in the cortical regions. Knowledge of these in vivo rate constants serves as a necessary step in using [F-18]fallypride PET to measure D2/D3 receptor density and drug occupancy in clinical research applications. We believe the precise parameter estimates derived from these complicated experimental protocols are necessary for proper application of drug occupancy and clinical research studies with [F-18]fallypride, which often rely on the validity of assumptions regarding the model parameters.","Wright State Univ SOM, Dept PET Nuc Med, Kettering Med Ctr, Kettering, OH 45429 USA; Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Irvine, CA USA","University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of California System; University of California Irvine","Christian, BT (corresponding author), Wright State Univ SOM, Dept PET Nuc Med, Kettering Med Ctr, 3535 So Blvd, Kettering, OH 45429 USA.","brad.christian@kmcnetwork.org","Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/O-1320-2013","Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/0000-0003-1009-877X",,,,,40,49,49,0,3,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","0271-678X","1559-7016",,"J CEREBR BLOOD F MET","J.

Fibers of the anterior thalamic peduncle intermingle with frontopontine tract fibers. Single fibers connect the caudate and the lentiform nucleus. The pyramidal tract is located in the anterior half of the posterior limb intermingled with fibers of the superior thalamic peduncle. Parietooccipitopontine fibers are located in the posterior part of the posterior limb. The slopes of the different systems of fibers change continuously in the anterior-posterior direction of the internal capsule. Using the 3D orientation of fibers as a criterion for parcellation, as well as the description of bundles as a collection of fibers belonging to particular tracts leads to a more function-related description of the anatomy of the internal capsule. The method can be used for interindividual, sex- or age-related comparisons of particular systems of fibers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mechanism is poorly understood. High-frequency STN DBS has been reported to affect motor cortex excitability in a complex way, but the timing between STN stimuli and changes in motor cortical (M1) excitability has not been investigated. We examined the time course of changes in motor cortical excitability following single pulse STN DBS. We studied 14 PD patients with implanted DBS electrodes in the STN, 2 patients with electrodes in internal globus pallidus (GPi), and 1 patient with an electrode in the sensory thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the M1 ipsilateral to the DBS with induced currents either in the anterior-posterior direction in the brain to evoke indirect ( I) waves or in the lateral-medial direction to activate corticospinal axons directly. Single pulse stimulation through the DBS contacts preceded the TMS by 0 - 10 ms. Surface EMG was recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. Three milliseconds after STN stimulation, the motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitudes produced by anterior-posterior current were significantly larger than control responses, while the responses to lateral-medial currents were unchanged. Similar facilitation also occurred after GPi stimulation, but not with thalamic stimulation. Single pulse STN stimulation facilitates the M1 at short latencies. The possible mechanisms include antidromic excitation of the cortico-STN fibers or transmission through the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway.","Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Div Neurol, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Div Neurosurg, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada","University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto","Hanajima, R (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.","hanajima-tky@umin.ac.jp","Chen, Robert/B-3899-2009; Lozano, Andres M/A-5058-2012; Lang, Anthony/ABF-8114-2021","Chen, Robert/0000-0002-8371-8629; Lozano, Andres M./0000-0001-8257-3694; Lang, Anthony/0000-0003-1229-3667",,,,,42,44,46,0,4,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

However, some stroke patients show the reverse pattern. Although their processing of visual and vestibular inputs for orientation perception of the Visual world is undisturbed, they push away actively from the ipsilesional side (the side of lesion location), leading to a contraversive tilt of the body (tilt toward the side opposite to the lesion) and falling to that side. Recently, the origin of contraversive pushing was identified as an altered perception of the body's orientation in relation to gravity. These patients experience their body as oriented upright when actually tilted enormously to the ipsilesional side (18 degrees on average). The findings argued for a separate pathway in humans for sensing body orientation in relation to gravity apart from the one projecting to the vestibular cortex. The present study aimed at identifying this brain area. The infarcted brain regions of 23 consecutively admitted patients with severe contraversive pushing were projected onto a template MRI scan, which had been normalized to Talairach space. The overlapping area of these infarctions centered on the posterolateral thalamus. Our finding necessitates reinterpretation of this area as being only a relay structure of the Vestibular pathway on its way from the brainstem to the vestibular cortex. The Ventral posterior and lateral posterior nuclei of the posterolateral thalamus (and probably its cortical projections) rather seem to be fundamentally involved in the neural representation of a second graviceptive system in humans decisive for our control of upright body posture.","Univ Tubingen, Dept Cognit Neurol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Univ Tubingen, Dept Gen Neurol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen","Karnath, HO (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Cognit Neurol, Hoppe Seyler Str 3, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,31,112,117,0,13,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424",,,"P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

The early genesis of the central monoaminergic neurons in mammals has led to postulations of a trophic role of monoamines in brain morphogenesis-especially in the cerebral cortex. The developmental effects of amines can be linked to the transient expression of different molecules linked to dopamine or serotonin neurotransmission. We present novel data on the immunocytochemistry of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and of the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT) in human fetuses. SERT is a marker of the serotoninergic axons and allows visualization of the serotonin afferents of the raphe in the human telencephalon. In addition, during a restricted time period corresponding to 12-14 postovulatory weeks, we found SERT-immunolabeled fibers in the rostral and caudal limbs of the internal capsule that do not correspond to serotoninergic fibers, but do coincide with the calbindin D28k-labeled thalamocortical fiber tracts. The present observations are correlated with findings in rodents, in which a transient expression of SERT is visible in the thalamocortical axons during early postnatal life. The function of this transporter has been shown to be important for the fine-tuning of cortical sensory maps during the critical period of development of these maps. Although the present observation does not allow ascertainment of which neurons transiently express SERT, it lends support to the notion that serotonin and serotonin uptake could have important developmental roles, during the formation of brain connections in humans, as they have in rodents.","Hop Robert Debre, INSERM E9935, F-75019 Paris, France; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U106, Paris, France","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre - APHP; 4EU+; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)","Verney, C (corresponding author), Hop Robert Debre, INSERM E9935, 48 Bd Serurier, F-75019 Paris, France.",,"Lebrand, Cecile/G-1394-2015; Gaspar, Patricia/G-8892-2011","Lebrand, Cecile/0000-0002-2750-3164; Gaspar, Patricia/0000-0003-4217-5717",,,,,52,75,76,0,3,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA","0003-276X",,,"ANAT REC","Anat.

This study examines how the connections of layer VI neurons are arranged with respect to the functionally distinct classes of neurons that compose their cortical and subcortical targets. By placing injections of biocytin into layer VI of tree shrew striate cortex, we identified two sublayers that differ in their intracortical and thalamic connections. Neurons in the upper part of layer VI, layer VIa, terminate in cortical layer IV, whereas those in the lower part of layer VI, layer VIb, terminate throughout the supragranular layers, layers I-III. The selectivity of layer VI subdivisions for the granular and supragranular layers is also evident in their descending projections. Neurons in layer Via terminate preferentially in the LGN layers that supply layer IV (LGN layers 1, 2, 4, and 5), whereas neurons in layer VIb terminate in the LGN layers that supply layers I-III (LGN layers 3 and 6) and in the pulvinar nucleus. Additional subclasses of layer VIa neurons were identified based on the restriction of their terminal fields to narrow subtiers within layer IV. By influencing the activity of distinct populations of cortical neurons and the thalamic neurons that supply them, layer VI neurons could exert a powerful influence on the flow of activity in functionally distinct cortical circuits.","DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT NEUROBIOL, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA","Duke University",,,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY06821] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,63,50,51,0,0,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

However, the contribution of subcortical structures remains unknown. The basal ganglia provide serial tonic inhibitory connections between the DLPFC and the SC, and could therefore be involved in preventing the triggering of unnecessary saccades. The DLPFC could also exert its inhibitory effect on the SC through direct prefronto-tectal pathways that travel in the internal capsule (IC). Since thalamic dysfunction may be responsible for reduced DLPFC activation, it may be hypothesized that the thalamus could also participate in saccadic inhibition. Methods: The authors recorded reflexive saccade triggering (prosaccade task) and inhibition (antisaccade task) in 29 patients with a single lesion affecting the striatum, the thalamus, or the IC, and compared these results to control subjects. Results: A normal error rate in the antisaccade task was found in patients with 1) a basal ganglia lesion, 2) a thalamic lesion, or 3) a lesion restricted to the posterior half of the posterior limb of the IC. An increased error rate in the antisaccade task was found in patients with a lesion affecting the anterior limb, the genu, or the anterior half of the posterior limb of the IC. Conclusion: These results suggest that neither the basal ganglia nor the thalamus plays a major role in reflexive saccade suppression, but support the hypothesis of a direct DLPFC inhibitory control of saccade triggering on the SC.","Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, F-75651 Paris 13, France; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Explorat Fonct Syst Nerveux, F-75651 Paris 13, France; Humboldt Univ, Charite, Neurol Klin, Berlin, Germany","Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin","Gaymard, B (corresponding author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, 47 Bd Hop, F-75651 Paris 13, France.","gaymard@ccr.jussieu.fr","Ostendorf, Florian/E-8342-2013; Ostendorf, Florian/AAE-1348-2019","Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530",,,,,68,46,47,0,1,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0028-3878","1526-632X",,"NEUROLOGY","Neurology","NOV 9",2004,63,9,,,,,1571,1578,,"10.1212/01.WNL.0000142990.44979.5A","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.WNL.0000142990.44979.5A"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.WNL.0000142990.44979.5A"")",,,8,"Clinical Neurology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","869MJ",15534238,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000224987700008","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000224987700008"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

A second visual pathway has been postulated to pass through the thalamic pulvinar nucleus and to project to multiple regions of visual cortex. We have explored this second visual pathway using a method that allows us to identify the inputs and outputs of pulvinar neurons. Specifically, we applied microstimulation in the superficial layers of superior colliculus (SC) to test for orthodromic activation of pulvinar neurons receiving input from SC. We also microstimulated the cortical motion area MT and tested for antidromic activation of pulvinar to identify neurons projecting to MT (and to determine the presence of orthodromic input back to pulvinar). In this initial report, we concentrate on two observations. First, we find that there are clusters of neurons in the pulvinar that receive input from SC along with neurons that project to MT or receive input from MT. Second, we find that neurons with input from SC have characteristics of the SC superficial layers: they respond to visual stimuli but do not discharge before saccadic eye movements. Neurons projecting to MT respond similarly to these SC-input neurons, while those receiving input from MT more frequently show directional selectivity as does MT.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

Neuronal cell tropisms and infection patterns are viable options for obtaining viral vector-mediated transgene delivery that is selective for particular neuronal pathways. For example, several types of viral vectors can infect axon terminals (retrograde infections), which enables targeted transgene delivery to neurons that directly project to a particular viral injection region. Although recent studies in rodents have demonstrated that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) and 9 (AAV9) efficiently transduce neurons, the tropisms and infection patterns remain poorly understood in primate brains. Here, we constructed recombinant AAV8 or AAV9, which expressed an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene driven by a ubiquitous promoter (AAV8-EGFP and AAV9-EGFP, respectively), and stereotaxically injected it into several brain regions in marmosets and macaque monkeys. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed almost exclusive colocalization of EGFP fluorescence via AAV9-mediated gene transfer with a neuron-specific marker, indicating endogenous neuronal tropism of AAV9, which was consistent with our previous results utilizing AAV8. Injections of either AAV8-EGFP or AAV9-EGFP into the marmoset striatum resulted in EGFP expression in local striatal neurons as a result of local infection, as well as expression in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra via retrograde transport along nigrostriatal axonal projections. Retrograde infections were also observed in the frontal cortex and thalamus, which are known to have direct projections to the striatum. These local and retrograde gene transfers were further demonstrated in the geniculocortical pathway of the marmoset visual system. These findings indicate promising capabilities of AAV8 and AAV9 to deliver molecular tools into a range of primate neural systems in pathway-specific manners through their neuronal tropisms and infection patterns.

Less understood are the fidelity of entrainment to each stimulus pulse, whether entrainment patterns are stationary over time, and how responses differ among DBS targets. In this study, three rhesus macaques were implanted with a single DBS lead in VPLo, STN, or GP. Single-unit spike activity was recorded in the resting state in motor cortex during VPLo DBS, in GP during STN DBS, and in STN and pallidal-receiving area of motor thalamus (VLo) during GP DBS. VPLo DBS induced time-locked spike activity in 25% (n = 15/61) of motor cortex cells, with entrained cells following 7.5 +/- 7.4% of delivered pulses. STN DBS entrained spike activity in 26% (n = 8/27) of GP cells, which yielded time-locked spike activity for 8.7 +/- 8.4% of stimulus pulses. GP DBS entrained 67% (n = 14/21) of STN cells and 32% (n = 19/59) of VLo cells, which showed a higher fraction of pulses effectively inhibiting spike activity (82.0 +/- 9.6% and 86.1 +/- 16.6%, respectively). Latency of phase-locked spike activity increased over time in motor cortex (58%, VPLo DBS) and to a lesser extent in GP (25%, STN DBS). In contrast, the initial inhibitory phase observed in VLo and STN during GP DBS remained stable following stimulation onset. Together, these data suggest that circuit-level entrainment is low-pass filtered during high-frequency stimulation, most notably for glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, phase entrainment is not stationary or consistent at the circuit level for all DBS targets.","[Agnesi, Filippo; Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Muralidharan, Abirami; Baker, Kenneth B.; Vitek, Jerrold L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN USA","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, 7-105 NHH,312 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.","john5101@umn.edu",,"Baker, Kenneth/0000-0002-4435-7015","National Institutes of Health [NS-081118, NS-037019, NS077657]; Michael J.

With each of these markers, the inferior pulvinar complex can be subdivided into four distinct regions. Calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity is densely distributed in cells and neuropil within PI, except for a distinct centromedially located gap. This calbindin-poor zone, termed the medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(M)), corresponds precisely to a region that contains elevated cytochrome oxidase activity and parvalbumin immunostaining. The PI(M) extends slightly above and behind the classically defined limit of the inferior pulvinar, the corticotectal tract. Regions of inferior pulvinar with intense immunostaining for calbindin-D28k were the posterior division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(P), medial to PI(M)) and the central division (PI(C), lateral to PI(M)). A newly recognized lateral region, PI(L), adjoins the lateral geniculate nucleus and stains more lightly for calbindin and parvalbumin immunoreactivity and for cytochrome oxidase. Staining patterns for calbindin, parvalbumin, and cytochrome oxidase in the pulvinar of rhesus monkeys closely resemble those shown in squirrel monkey inferior pulvinar, suggesting that a common organization exists in all primates. In order to examine cortical connection patterns of the histochemically defined compartments in the inferior pulvinar, injections of up to five neuroanatomical tracers (wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent retrograde tracers) were placed in the same cerebral hemisphere. Single injection sites were in the middle temporal area (MT), and several separate injections were placed in a strip corresponding to the rostral subdivision of the dorsolateral area (DLr). Injections that involved only DLr and not MT labeled principally the PI(C), and more sparsely PI(P) and PI(L). DLr connections occupied a ''shell'' region dorsal to PI(M) that extended from PI(C) into the lateral and medial divisions of the pulvinar, PL and PM. Injection sites that included MT or were largely restricted to MT produced dense label in PI(M) and moderate label in PI(C) and PI(L). The retinotopic organization within the inferior pulvinar was inferred from patterns of connections. Connections with cortex related most closely to central vision were found posteriorly in PI(M) and in adjacent portions of PI(C) as it wraps around the caudal pole of PI(M). Cortex related to more peripheral locations in the lower visual field connected with more rostral PI(M) and PI(C). Patterns of label within the portions of PL and PM that were immediately adjacent to PI(M) roughly paralleled those in PI(M) and PI(C). Thus, a distinct chemoarchitectonic subdivision of the inferior pulvinar, PI(M), is the major source of thalamic projections to MT in squirrel monkeys. Interestingly, the relative scarcity of calbindin immunostaining in PI(M) is characteristic of ''primary'' thalamic relay nuclei, such as the ventroposterior and lateral geniculate nuclei. Thus, the PI(M)-MT pathway may share certain physiological characteristics with primary sensory relays, such as those involving intracellular calcium buffering and, perhaps, rapid and secure impulse transmission.

Nine healthy subjects were recruited to the study and underwent scanning on a 3T magnet. We were able to define well-known image-forming (optic nerve -> lateral geniculate -> visual cortex) as well as a less known nonimage forming visual pathway from the optic chiasm to the pulvinar, and from the pulvinar to several associative cortical brain regions. Such pathway may allow photic signals to converge on a thalamic region we described recently to be selectively activated during migraine headache.

Cells projecting to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV cells), the medial mammillary body (MMB cells), and the nucleus accumbens (ACC cells) were observed consistently throughout the entire septotemporal (dorsoventral) and transverse extent of the subiculum (from field CA1 of the hippocampus to the presubiculum). In the transverse plane, the three kinds of projection cells were arranged in a laminar fashion: The AV cells were observed in the deepest portion of the subicular pyramidal cell layer, the ACC cells were observed in the most superficial portion of the layer, and the MMB cells were observed in the middle portion of the layer. Although this laminar arrangement was observed at all septotemporal levels of the subiculum, it was most apparent at the septal level. At more temporal levels, the laminae shifted such that the superficially located ACC cells were more prominent in the proximal half of the subiculum, whereas the AV cells were shifted toward the distal half of the subiculum. The average size of somata of the AV cells was 72.3 mum(2), that of the ACC cells was 105.2 mum(2), and that of the MMB cells was 121.8 mum(2) The connectional and cytoarchitectonic data indicate that there is a distinct sublamination of the subicular pyramidal cell layer, suggesting that the subiculum may be analogous to the infragranular layer (layers V and VI) of the isocortex.

Based on the somatotopical map prepared by intracortical microstimulation, injections of the anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, were made into the following motor-related areas: the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex, and the frontal eye field. Data obtained from the present experiments were as follows: (i) Corticotegmental inputs from orofacial, forelimb, and hindlimb representations of the primary motor cortex tended to be arranged orderly from medial to lateral in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. However, the distribution areas of these inputs considerably overlapped; (ii) The major input zones from distal representations of the: forelimb and hindlimb regions of the primary motor cortex were located medial to those from their proximal representations, although there was a substantial overlap between the distribution areas of distal versus proximal limb inputs; (iii) The main terminal zones from the forelimb regions of the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, and the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex appeared to overlap largely in the mediolaterally middle aspect of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus; and (iv) Corticotegmental input from the frontal eye field was scattered over the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus, the present results indicate that the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is likely to receive partly separate but essentially convergent cortical inputs not only from multiple motor-related areas representing the same body part, hut also from multiple regions representing diverse body parts. This suggests that somatotopical representations are intermingled rather than segregated in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. (C) 2000 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most direct pathway identified to the extrastriate cortex is a disynaptic one that provides robust magno- and parvocellular inputs to the middle temporal area (MT). The inclusion of parvocells in this projection is somewhat surprising because of their importance for color and form vision, whereas MT is more strictly tuned to velocity. This raises the question of whether areas more involved in color and form processing, such as V4, receive similar projections. We report here on experiments that use rabies virus injections into V4 to retrogradely label mono- and disynaptic inputs. We find only a small number of labeled neurons in the LGN in a pattern consistent with monosynaptic labeling of koniocells, rather than disynaptic labeling of magno- and parvocells. The lack of robust magno- and parvocellular label was not due to ineffective viral transport because in the same cases we find hundreds of neurons labeled in the thalamic reticular nucleus, a structure that can only be labeled disynaptically from the cortex. We also find a complete absence of neurons labeled in V1, but thousands in adjacent areas V2 and V3. This result helps explain the absence of labeled magno- and parvocells in the LGN because disynaptic transport from an extrastriate visual area should require a relay through V1. Taken together, these results suggest that ascending magno/parvocellular inputs to V4 are more hierarchically organized than the relatively direct inputs to MT. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:25002511, 2012.

This study compared regional brain serotonin transporter (SERT) binding between nine PR and seven mother-reared rhesus monkeys with [C-11] DASB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Parametric images of binding potential (BP) (which is proportional to B-max/K-D, in which B-max is transporter density and K-D is dissociation constant) and relative blood flow (R-1) were generated by the two-parameter multilinear reference tissue model. R1 images were used for coregistration and normalization of PET parametric data to the magnetic resonance imaging template space. Group BP differences were analyzed voxelwise by Student's t test in SPM2. Region of interest-based parameter values were also calculated to obtain the magnitude of regional BP differences between the two groups. For the PR group, SERT BP was decreased by 10 - 23% across a range of brain areas consisting of the raphe, thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate and putamen, globus pallidum, anterior cingulate gyrus, and medial temporal regions, including amygdala and hippocampus (cluster-level corrected p = 0.002). For the latter three regions, BP was decreased in the right hemisphere. These results agree with the hypothesis that early maternal deprivation affects the development of the serotonergic system and suggest that decreased serotonergic innervations in the critical brain regions may explain some of the behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in PR monkeys.","NIMH, Mol Imaging Branch, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIAAA, Clin Studies Lab, Primate Unit, Div Intramural Clin & Biol Res, Poolesville, MD 20837 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Child Psychiat & Lab Med, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; NICHD, Comparat Ethol Lab, Natl Inst Hlth Anim Ctr, Poolesville, MD 20837 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA); Yale University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)","Ichise, M (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St,ASBI-L1-037-E, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","michise@partners.org",,,"Intramural NIH HHS Funding Source: Medline","Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)",,,45,116,117,0,10,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

We examined the effects of attention on the receptive fields of simple cells in primary visual cortex ( V1) by training macaque monkeys to perform a task with two modes. In the attended mode, the stimuli relevant to the animal's task overlay the receptive field of the neuron being recorded. In the unattended mode, the animal was cued to attend to stimuli outside the receptive field of that neuron. The relevant stimulus, a colored pixel, was briefly presented within a white-noise stimulus, a flickering grid of black and white pixels. The receptive fields of the neurons were mapped by correlating spikes with the white-noise stimulus in both attended and unattended modes. We found that attention could cause significant modulation of the visually evoked response despite an absence of significant effects on the overall firing rates. On further examination of the relationship between the strength of the visual stimulation and the firing rate, we found that attention appears to cause multiplicative scaling of the visually evoked responses of simple cells, demonstrating that attention reaches back to the initial stages of visual cortical processing.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","McAdams, CJ (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, 200 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","cmcadams@hms.harvard.edu","McAdams, Carrie J./M-6822-2017","McAdams, Carrie J./0000-0002-4768-6703","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY012815, R01 EY12815] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [T32 NS07484, T32 NS007484] Funding Source: Medline; PHS HHS [P30 12196] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,42,131,133,1,13,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Angiotensin IV binding sites (also known as the AT(4) receptors) are widely distributed in guinea pig and monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brains where high densities of the binding sites have been detected in the hippocampus. neocortex and motor nuclei. However, the distribution of the binding sites in the human brain is not known. We have recently localised the angiotensin IV binding sites (AT(4) receptors) in post-mortem human brain using iodinated Nle-angiotensin IV, a higher affinity and more stable analogue of angiotensin IV. This radioligand bound with relatively high affinity and specificity to angiotensin IV binding sites. In competition studies on consecutive sections through the prefrontal cortex and claustrum, angiotensin IV. Nle-angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 competed for the binding of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV with nanomolar affinities. Angiotensin II and the AT(4) and AT(4) receptor antagonists were ineffective in competing for the binding at concentrations of up to 10 muM. We found high densities of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites throughout the cerebral cortex including the insular, entorhinal, prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Very high densities of the binding sites were observed in the claustrum, choroid plexus, hippocampus and pontine nucleus. Some thalamic nuclei displayed high densities of binding including the anteroprincipal, ventroanterior, anteromedial, medial dorsal acid ventrolateral nuclei. The caudate nucleus, putamen, many amygdaloid nuclei and the red nucleus all displayed moderate densities of binding with a higher level detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In the hypothalamus, high densities binding sites were found in the ventromedial nucleus with lower levels in the dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei. The distribution of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites in the human brain is similar to that found in other species and supports multiple roles for the binding sites in the central nervous system, including facilitation of memory retention and retrieval.

Forty individual axons were analyzed by serial section reconstruction and divided into two major groups. The majority of axons have numerous (typically 500-1,000) small, spinous endings (boutons terminaux). These axons have terminal fields that are beam-like or elongated (E, corresponding to classical type 1) and highly divergent (1.0-3.0 mm). These frequently innervate several of the traditionally designated pulvinar subdivisions; namely inferior pulvinar (PI) and the ventral part of interal pulvinar (PL); medial pulvinar (PM) and dorsal FL, and (one axon) PM, dorsal FL, and PI. Some axons, however (R or round, corresponding to classical type 2), have a small number (typically 70-160) of primarily large, beaded endings (boutons en passant), which concentrate in sharply delimited, round arbors (diameters 100-125 mu m). R axons appear to be larger caliber than E axons (1.0-1.5 mu m vs. 0.5-1.0 mu m, respectively). These differences in phenotype are probably associated with distinct types of projection neurons. In visual areas, corticopulvinar terminations are reported to originate from pyramidal cell subpopulations in layer 5. Indirect evidence, presented here, suggests that the more numerous medium-sized neurons give rise to E axons, and the sparser giant pyramids give rise to R corticopulvinar axons. If this is correct, corticopulvinar connectivity may be involved in multiple transformations. Spatially, axons of giant neurons (with basal dendrites that collect intracortically from a disc-like area, about 1.0 mm in diameter) converge onto a small number of pulvinar neurons. Axons of medium neurons (with basal dendrites that occupy a small intracortical disc, about 0.3 mm in diameter) diverge over 1.0-3.0 mm in the pulvinar and may form many contacts. Giant neurons, although numerically few in relation to medium pyramids (1 or 2: 50?), are likely to have distinctive membrane properties (functionally equivalent to bursting neurons?). Their larger boutons and axon caliber may be associated with a faster transmission that compensates for their small numbers. In primates, the E and R duality does not characterize cortical projections to the caudate, lateral geniculate nucleus, pens, or superior colliculus and thus may be essentially linked to pulvinar-specific processes.

Some studies of human patients with occipital lobe injury have found no evidence transneuronal retrograde degeneration, suggesting that either degeneration may not occur or, if present, it is caused directly by secondary damage impinging upon the underlying white matter or the blood supply to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and optic tract. We therefore studied retinal ganglion cell degeneration in three macaques in which only the striate cortex corresponding: to the macular retina had been removed, thereby sparing extrastriate colter and precluding interruption of the vascular supply to the thalamus and optic tract. There was extensive loss of ganglion cells in the central retina, corresponding to the central 10 degrees of vision. As the cortical lesion was too small to affect the thalamus or optic tract directly, the retinal degeneration must he transneuronal. Quantitative analysis showed a 65-80% loss of ganglion cells in the corresponding perifoveal retinae along the horizontal meridian. The results: confirm that the loss of retinal gan linn cells following striate cortical lesions is predominantly transneuronal.","Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England","University of Oxford","Johnson, H (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England.",,,,,,,,25,62,66,0,6,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

On the basis of their verbal fluency scores, two subgroups of the ALS patients (five high, five low scores) and a different group of five age-matched controls then underwent positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Scans were performed in the resting state and while subjects performed stereotyped or freely selected movements of a joystick with their right hand. The pattern of cerebral activation associated with self-generated activity was determined by comparing the profile of rCBF during freely selected and stereotyped joystick movements. Statistical parametric mapping was used to determine significant differences in rCBF between the groups at rest and during activation. Regional cerebral blood now at rest was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced in the anterior cingulate cortex of both ALS subgroups in comparison with controls. The profile of cortical and subcortical activation during performance of freely selected joystick movements relative to stereotyped movements was abnormal in ALS patients: (i) ALS patients with a normal fluency score showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the left medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and the right and left parahippocampal gyri; (ii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the right and left medial prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), the rostral aspects of the right anterior cingulate cortex (areas 24 and 32), the right parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex; (iii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with patients with normal verbal fluency in the right parahippocampal gyrus, the anterior thalamic nuclear complex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (area 24). Regional cerebral blood flow at rest in the right parahippocampal gyrus of ALS patients was significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.01) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). Activation of the anterior thalamic nuclear complex in ALS patients was also significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.001) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). The results show that abnormalities of function are present in regions along a limbo-thalamo-cortical pathway in some ALS patients during performance of a self-generated motor task. Those ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency show more significantly impaired function in these regions than ALS patients with normal verbal fluency. The findings support the view that dysfunction of cortical neurons in ALS extends beyond those contributing to the corticospinal tract.","UNIV LONDON,INST PSYCHIAT,DEPT NEUROL,LONDON,ENGLAND; KINGS COLL,SCH MED & DENT,LONDON,ENGLAND; INST PSYCHIAT,DEPT PSYCHOL,LONDON,ENGLAND; INST NEUROL,LONDON,ENGLAND; DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,OXFORD,ENGLAND","University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; University College London","KEW, JJM (corresponding author), HAMMERSMITH HOSP,MRC,CYCLOTRON UNIT,DU CANE RD,LONDON W12 0HS,ENGLAND.",,"Frackowiak, Richard S/I-1809-2013; Leigh, Peter/AAD-5638-2019; Goldstein, Laura H./E-7817-2010; Frackowiak, Richard/H-4383-2011","Goldstein, Laura H./0000-0001-9387-3035; Frackowiak, Richard/0000-0002-3151-822X; Brooks, David/0000-0003-2602-2518",,,,,59,221,223,0,8,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM","OXFORD","WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0006-8950",,,"BRAIN","Brain","DEC",1993,116,,6,,,,1399,1423,,"10.1093/brain/116.6.1399","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/116.6.1399"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/116.6.1399"")",,,25,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","MW136",8293278,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993MW13600007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993MW13600007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The results revealed that the pattern of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity varied systematically throughout the rhesus monkey hypothalamus. Extremely high densities of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes were observed in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, while relatively lower levels were found in the arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei and in the medial preoptic, perifornical, and suprachiasmatic areas. Moderate levels of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity were found throughout the lateral hypothalamic area and in the internal lamina of the median eminence. Very few immunoreactive processes were found in the ventromedial nucleus or in the mammillary complex. Other midline diencephalic structures were found to have high densities of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity, including the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and a discrete subregion of nucleus reuniens, the magnocellular subfascicular nucleus. A moderate density of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactive processes were found in the rhomboid nucleus and zona incerta whereas little dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity was found in the fields of Forel, nucleus reuniens, or subthalamic nucleus. The differential distribution of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes may reflect a potential role of norepinephrine as a regulator of a variety of functions associated with the nuclei that are most heavily innervated, e.g., neuroendocrine release from the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and gonadotropin release from the medial preoptic area and mediobasal hypothalamus. Additionally, quantitative analysis of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive varicosities was performed on a laser scanning microscope in both magnocellular and parvicellular regions of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The methodology employed in this study allowed for the high resolution of immunoreactive profiles through the volume of tissue being analyzed, and was more accurate than conventional light microscopy in terms of varicosity quantification. Quantitatively, a significant difference in the density of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive varicosities was found between magnocellular and parvicellular regions, suggesting that parvicellular neurons received a denser noradrenergic input. These differential patterns may reflect an important functional role for norepinephrine in the regulation of anterior pituitary secretion through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis.","CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; Scripps Res Inst, RES INST, DEPT NEUROPHARMACOL, LA JOLLA, CA 92037 USA","City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Scripps Research Institute","GINSBERG, SD (corresponding author), CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA.",,"Bartold, Mark/H-8122-2019; Ginsberg, Stephen D/AAB-3329-2022; Morrison, John H/F-9229-2012","Ginsberg, Stephen D/0000-0002-1797-4288; ","NIMH NIH HHS [MH45212] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,66,23,23,0,1,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

In guinea pig brain, the [H-3] LY334370 binding sites were found at highest density in claustrum, but also in a layer of the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and medial mammillary nucleus. Some species differences in the distribution of the 5-HT1F receptor were noted. Side by side comparison of rat brain autoradiography with [H-3] LY334370 and [H-3] sumatriptan showed labeling in the same brain regions. Preliminary binding studies in rhesus monkey and human brain sections showed [H-3] LY334370 binding in cortical layers 4-5, subiculum ( in the monkey), and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum.

Strong local projections from the NOT were demonstrated to the superior colliculus and the dorsal terminal nucleus bilaterally and to the contralateral NOT. The contralateral oculomotor complex, including motoneurons (C-group) and subdivisions of the Edinger-Westphal complex, also received inputs. NOT efferents terminated in all accessory optic nuclei (AON) ipsilaterally; contralateral AON projections arose from the pretectal olivary nucleus embedded in the NOT. Descending pathways contacted precerebellar nuclei: the dorsolateral and dorsomedial pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and the inferior olive. Direct projections from NOT to the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (ppH) appeared to be weak, but retrograde tracer injections into rostral ppH verified this projection; furthermore, the injections demonstrated that AON efferents also enter this area. Efferents from the NOT also targeted ascending reticular networks from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the locus coeruleus. Rostrally, NOT projections included the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (Ign); the pregeniculate, peripeduncular, and thalamic reticular nuclei; and the pulvinar, the zona incerta, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the hypothalamus. The NOT could generate optokinetic nystagmus through projections to the AON, the ppH, and the precerebellar nuclei. However, NOT also projects to structures controlling saccades, ocular pursuit, the near response, Ign motion sensitivity, visual attention, vigilance, and gain modification of the vestibule-ocular reflex. Any hypothesis on the function of NOT must take into account its connectivity to all of these visuomotor structures.

The constituent neurons are mostly koniocellular, send virtually no collateral axons to primary visual cortex (V1) and equal about 10% of the V1 population innervating MT.

Yet, while electrophysiological correlates suggest that FO is generated within intracortical networks, contributions of subcortical structures along the trigeminal pathway remain uncertain. Using surface and laminar electrode arrays, in vivo recordings of vibrissal and electrically evoked FO were made within somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rodents before and after ablation of the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) or during reversible cortical cooling. In VB-lesioned animals, vibrissal stimulation failed to evoke FO, while epicortical stimulation in lesioned animals remained effective in generating FO. In nonlesioned animals, cortical cooling eliminated vibrissal-evoked FO despite the persistence of thalamocortical input. Vibrissal-evoked FO returned with the return to physiological temperatures. Results from this study indicate that somatosensory cortex alone is able to initiate and sustain FO. Moreover, these data suggest that cortical network interactions are solely responsible for the generation of FO, while synchronized thalamocortical input serves as the afferent trigger.","Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Barth, DS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Campus Box 345, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,"Staba, Richard/AAN-3149-2021",,"NINDS NIH HHS [2 R01 NS-36981] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,42,15,15,0,0,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Local rates of cerebral metabolism were determined after an intravenous infusion of 1.0 mg/kg cocaine or vehicle in six awake cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) trained to sit calmly in a primate chair. Cocaine administration decreased glucose utilization in a discrete set of structures that included both cortical and subcortical portions of the limbic system. Glucose metabolism in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens was decreased markedly, and smaller decrements were observed in the caudate and anterior putamen. In addition, cocaine administration produced significant decreases in limbic cortex. Metabolism was decreased in orbitofrontal cortex (areas 11, 12o, 13, 13a, 13b), portions of the gyrus rectus including area 25, entorhinal cortex, and parts of the hippocampal formation. The cortical regions in which functional activity was altered provide dense projections to the nucleus accumbens, and the decreased activity in these projections may be responsible in part for the large alterations in functional activity within the ventral striatum, Decreased metabolism also was evident in the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus, raphe nuclei, and locus ceruleus, The acute cerebral metabolic effects of cocaine in the conscious macaque, therefore, were contained primarily within a set of interconnected limbic regions, including ventral prefrontal cortex, medial temporal regions, the ventral striatal complex, and anterior thalamus. The decreased rates of glucose metabolism reported here resemble decrements found using positron emission tomography in humans. In the rat, by contrast, metabolic activity increased and changes were focused in subcortical regions, The present results represent an important expansion of the neural circuitry on which cocaine acts in the monkey as compared with the rat, and this in turn implies that cocaine affects a broader spectra of behaviors in primates than in rodents.","WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,CTR NEUROBIOL INVEST DRUGS ABUSE,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27157","Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center",,,"Lyons, David James/AAA-2672-2021; Friedman, David P/G-7842-2011","Friedman, David P/0000-0003-1732-2404","NIDA NIH HHS [DA06829, DA07955, DA09085] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA))",,,65,99,100,1,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas.

In this study, we have employed positron emission tomography measurements of resting brain glucose metabolism (CMRglc) to investigate the neural substrates underlying this dysfunction, taking PD as a model disease to assess, within the framework of Alexander's striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical cognitive circuits the functional neuroanatomy of the central executive. We studied central executive performance in 17 non-demented, highly selected PD patients, by means of the Brown-Peterson paradigm (BPP), and correlated the BPP performance according to various response delays (from 0 to 18 s) with local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose. We document for the first time that the BPP performance in PD is heterogeneous not only across delays (with PD patients selectively impaired for the 0 and 3 s delays, compatible with impaired attention and central executive, respectively), but also from subject to subject; a multiple correspondence analysis was able to distinguish two patient subgroups according to short delay BPP performance. The correlational analysis with PET data evidenced a limited number of significant correlations, most of which were consistent with our working hypothesis. Notably, a positive correlation between lateral frontal relative metabolism and BPP performance for short delays, and a negative one between these scores and mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus metabolism, would fit the way in which caudate dopamine denervation would alter in opposite directions frontal cortex and MD nucleus synaptic activity and in turn affect central executive function. The results from this study lend further support to the role of altered thalamo-prefrontal interplay as the basis for central executive dysfunction in PD.","UNIV CAEN, CYCERON, F-14032 CAEN, FRANCE; UNIV CAEN, INSERM, U320, F-14032 CAEN, FRANCE; UNIV CAEN, CTR HOSP UNIV, SERV NEUROL DEJERINE, F-14032 CAEN, FRANCE; UNIV CAEN, CEA, DSV DRIPP, F-14032 CAEN, FRANCE","Universite de Caen Normandie; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Caen Normandie; CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Universite de Caen Normandie; CEA; Universite de Caen Normandie",,,"Eustache, Francis/J-9465-2015","Eustache, Francis/0000-0003-4460-8686; baron, jean-claude/0000-0002-5264-2588",,,,,77,32,32,0,5,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1351-5101","1468-1331",,"EUR J NEUROL","Eur.

Altered expression of FMR1 mRNA and related proteins have been identified as the likely mechanisms by which many aspects of the (fraX) phenotype are induced. A 1993 study delineated certain brain areas in which the mRNA is expressed in human, non-fraX 8-, 9-, and 25-week fetuses. Although FMR1 products in the conceptus vary with regard to timings, relative amounts, and locations, a preliminary set of postnatal, neuroanatomical ramifications has been developed. First, the highest FMR1 mRNA labeling occurred in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), hippocampus, thalamus, and layers of the fetal cerebral cortex. Second, in primates and humans, the amygdala are primary recipients of cholinergic innervation from the nbM, with amygdaloid choline acetyltransferase levels surpassing those of any other area of the brain, and nbM-amygdaloid innervation is bidirectional. Third, FMR1 mRNA is present in the neocortical plate, and the nbM and amygdala have bidirectional innervations with the neocortex. Neurological and neuropsychiatric literature indicates that amygdaloid anomalies can generate traits very similar to some of those documented in fraX individuals, e.g., interpersonal phenomena such as gaze aversion, social avoidance, and shyness. Although other nuclei and regions with significant fetal levels of FMR1 mRNA have been identified (thalamus, subthalamus, putamen, pallidum, cerebellum), that so many fraX traits are found in the amygdaloid literature suggests that the amygdala be included as an important substrate for certain symptoms strongly associated with fraX.

The modularity is best seen in tangential sections, with double-labeling immunohistochemistry to reveal overlapping or complementary relationships of different markers. The pattern is overall like a reticulum or mosaic but is described as a honeycomb, in which the walls and hollows are composed of distinct afferent and dendritic systems. We demonstrate the main components of the honeycomb in rat visual cortex. These are as follows: (1) zinc-enriched, corticocortical terminations in the walls, and in the hollows, thalamocortical terminations (labeled by antibody against vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and by cytochrome oxidase); (2) parvalbumin-dense neuropil in the walls that partly colocalizes with elevated levels of glutamate receptors 2/3, NMDAR receptor 1, and calbindin; and (3) dendritic subpopulations preferentially situated within the walls (dendrites of layer 2 neurons) or hollows (dendrites of deeper neurons in layers 3 and 5). Because the micromodularity is restricted to layers 2 and 1b, without extending into layer 3, this may be another indication of a laminar-specific substructure at different spatial scales within cortical columns. The suggestion is that corticocortical and thalamocortical terminations constitute parallel circuits at the level of layer 2, where they are segregated in association with distinct dendritic systems. Results from parvalbumin staining show that the honeycomb mosaic is not limited to rat visual cortex but can be recognized at the layer 1-2 border in other areas and species.","RIKEN, Lab Cort Organizat Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Dept Morphol Brain Sci, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","RIKEN; Kyoto University","Ichinohe, N (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Organizat Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.","nichinohe@brain.riken.go.jp",,"Fujiyama, Fumino/0000-0001-9619-8928; Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785",,,,,74,50,50,1,3,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","1529-2401",,"J NEUROSCI","J.

As a consequence, human brain imaging studies have focused on its role in the sensory perception of emotions. However, evidence from neurophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that the insula is also involved in generating emotional and communicative facial expressions. In particular, a recent study demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the mid-ventral sector of the insula evoked affiliative facial expressions. The present study aimed to describe the cortical connections of this affiliative field. To this aim, we identified the region with electrical stimulation and injected neural tracers to label incoming and outgoing projections. Our results show that the insular field underlying emotional expression is part of a network involving specific frontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal areas, as well as the amygdala, the basal ganglia, and thalamus, indicating that this sector of the insula is a site of integration of motor, emotional, sensory and social information. Together with our previous functional studies, this result challenges the classic view of the insula as a multisensory area merely reflecting bodily and internal visceral states. In contrast, it supports an alternative perspective: that the emotional responses classically attributed to the insular cortex are endowed with an enactive component intrinsic to each social and emotional behavior.","[Jezzini, Ahmad] Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Rozzi, Stefano; Borra, Elena; Gallese, Vittorio; Caruana, Fausto; Gerbella, Marzio] Univ Parma, Dept Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Caruana, Fausto] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Brain Ctr Social & Motor Cognit, I-43125 Parma, Italy","Washington University (WUSTL); University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT","Jezzini, A (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Campus Box 8108,660 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","ahmadmjezzini@gmail.com; fausto.caruana@unipr.it","Jezzini, Ahmad/S-2289-2018; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Gallese, Vittorio/ABD-5097-2021; Caruana, Fausto/J-5274-2018","Jezzini, Ahmad/0000-0003-2380-7336; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Gallese, Vittorio/0000-0003-4815-3607; Caruana, Fausto/0000-0002-4631-7543","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005]; European Commission Grant Cogsystems [FP7-250013]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]; RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission Grant Cogsystems; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT","This work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (grant number: PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005), European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013, Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11, and RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT.

The aim of this study is to identify the SFOF using both in vitro and in vivo anatomo-functional analyses. This study consisted of two approaches. First, one acallosal brain and 12 normal postmortem hemispheres (five left and seven right sides) were dissected under a microscope using Klingler's fiber dissection technique. We focused on the medial subcallosal area superior to the Muratoff bundle, which has been indicated as a principal target area of the SFOF in previous studies. Second, 90 patients underwent awake craniotomy for gliomas with direct electrical stimulations. Functional examinations for visual, ataxic, and cognitive tasks were performed and 453 positive mapping sites were investigated by voxel-based morphometry analysis to establish the functions of the SFOF. The corticostriatal fibers, or the Muratoff bundle, and thalamic peduncle fibers joined in the area of the caudate nucleus, making thalamic peduncle/ corticostriatal bundles, which ran antero-posteriorly in the anterior subcallosal area and radiated from the caudate superior margin in the posterior subcallosal area. However, no SFOF fiber bundle crossed perpendicular to the thalamic peduncle/ corticostriatal bundles in the posterior subcallosal area. In the acallosal hemispheres, Probst bundles were confirmed and the subcallosal areas did not show a specific organization different from the normal brain. Hence, we could not detect a long and continuous association fascicle connecting the frontal lobe and occipital or parietal lobe in the target areas. Furthermore, in the in vivo functional mappings of awake surgery and voxel-based morphometry analysis, eight positive points on the SFOF were selected from the total 453 positive points, but their functions were not related with visual processing and spatial awareness, as has been reported in previous studies. In conclusion, in the present study we attempted to investigate the existence of the SFOF using an anatomical and functional approach. According to our results, the SFOF may not exist in the human brain.","[Liu, Xiaoliang; Kinoshita, Masashi; Nakada, Mitsutoshi] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Neurosurg, 13-1 Takara Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208641, Japan; [Shinohara, Harumichi; Ozaki, Noriyuki] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Funct Anat, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Hori, Osamu] Kanazawa Univ, Dept Neuroanat, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Liu, Xiaoliang] Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, Changchun, Peoples R China","Kanazawa University; Kanazawa University; Kanazawa University; Jilin University","Kinoshita, M (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Dept Neurosurg, 13-1 Takara Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208641, Japan.","m-kinoshita@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp","Kinoshita, Masashi/AAL-4312-2021; Nakada, Mitsutoshi/B-2790-2012","Kinoshita, Masashi/0000-0002-2148-8231; Nakada, Mitsutoshi/0000-0001-9419-6101","China Scholarship Council (National construction of high-quality University); JSPS KAKENHI [17K10859, 18H03126]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K10859, 18H03126] Funding Source: KAKEN","China Scholarship Council (National construction of high-quality University)(China Scholarship Council); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council (National construction of high-quality University projects of graduates to XL); and JSPS KAKENHI (17K10859 and 18H03126 to MK).",,40,7,7,0,0,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","2213-1582",,,"NEUROIMAGE-CLIN","NeuroImage-Clin.",,2020,25,,,,,,,,102192,"10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102192","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102192"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102192"")",,,8,"Neuroimaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","KU2JR",32014826,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000519535200041","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000519535200041"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The clinical signs, both perceptual and motor, of a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane are ocular tilt reaction (OTR), ocular torsion, skew deviation and tilts of the perceived visual vertical (SVV). Either complete OTR or skew torsion without head tilt indicates a unilateral peripheral deficit of otolith input or a unilateral lesion of graviceptive brainstem pathways from the vestibular nuclei (crossing midline at the pontine level) to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) in the rostral midbrain. SVV tilts are the most sensitive sign of a vestibular tone imbalance in roll and occur with peripheral or central vestibular lesions from the labyrinth to the vestibular cortex. All tilt effects, perceptual, ocular motor and postural, are ipsiversive (ipsilateral eye undermost) with unilateral peripheral or pontomedullary lesions below the crossing of the graviceptive pathways. All tilt effects are contraversive (contralateral eye undermost) with unilateral pontomesencephalic brainstem lesions and indicate involvement of the medial longitudinal fasciculus or the rostral midbrain (INC). Unilateral lesions of vestibular structures rostral to the INC typically manifest with deviations of perceived vertical without concurrent eye-head tilt. OTR in unilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions indicates simultaneous ischemia of the paramedian rostral midbrain including the INC. Unilateral lesions of the posterolateral thalamus can cause thalamic astasia and moderate ipsiversive or contraversive SVV tilts, thereby indicating involvement of the vestibular thalamic subnuclei. Unilateral lesions of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex cause moderate, mostly contraversive SVV tilts. An SVV tilt found with monocular but not with binocular viewing is typical for a trochlear or oculomotor palsy rather than a supranuclear graviceptive brainstem lesion.",,,"BRANDT, T (corresponding author), UNIV MUNICH, KLINIKUM GROSSHADERN, DEPT NEUROL, MARCHIONINISTR 15, D-81377 MUNICH, GERMANY.",,,,,,,,81,236,239,0,4,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0364-5134","1531-8249",,"ANN NEUROL","Ann.

Although pulsatile and continuous infusion paradigms have been described for convective delivery of drugs, the effectiveness and properties of each flow paradigm are unknown. To determine the effectiveness and properties of pulsatile and continuous convective infusion paradigms, the authors compared these convective flow methods in the gray and white matter of primates. Methods. Six primates (Macaca mulatta) underwent convective infusion of Gd-DPTA (5 mM) into the cerebral gray matter (thalamus) or white matter (frontal lobe) using pulsed (intermittent pulses of 15 mu l/min) or continuous (1 mu l/min) convective flow. Results were assessed by clinical MRI and histological analyses. Results. Distribution of Gd-DTPA infusate in gray and white matter by pulsed and continuous flow was clearly identified using MRI, which revealed that both convective flow methods demonstrated an increase in the volume of distribution (Vd) with increasing volume of infusion (Vi) in the surrounding gray and white matter. Although the mean (+/- SD) gray matter Vd:Vi ratio for the pulsed infusions (4.2 +/- 0.5) was significantly lower than the mean Vd:Vi ratio for continuous infusions (5.4 +/- 0.5; a 22% difference [P = 0.0006]), the difference between pulsed (3.8 +/- 0.4) and continuous (4.3 +/- 1.2) infusions in white matter was not significantly different (p = 0.3). Pulsed infusions were associated with more leakback (12.3% +/- 6.4% of Vi) than continuous infusions (3.9% +/- 7.8%), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.2). All animals tolerated the infusions and there was no histological evidence of tissue injury at the infusion sites. Conclusions. Although pulsed and continuous infusion flow paradigms can be safely and effectively used for convective delivery into both gray and white matter, continuous infusion is associated with a higher Vd:Vi ratio than pulsatile infusion in gray matter. High rates of infusion (15 mu l/min) can be used to deliver infusate without any significant leakback and without any clinical or histological evidence of injury.

Recently, molecular biological techniques have enabled us to find rare types of genes expressed in specific neocortical areas. We previously reported occ1 gene as preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex (V1), using the differential display method. Here, by differential display, we found selective and strong expression of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene, in higher-order association areas. In V1, RBP mRNA was expressed only in the superficial part of layer II, but its expression increased, involving deeper layers, along the visual pathway. In visual association areas such as TE, RBP mRNA was strongly expressed in both supra- and infragranular layers. In primary auditory and somatosensory areas, as in V1, RBP expression was low, and restricted to the upper part of the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of RBP expression is in marked contrast with that of occ1; and in early visual areas where both genes are expressed, these occur in distinct sublayers within the supragranular layers. In neonatal monkeys, the area-specific expression pattern of RBP was less distinct, suggesting that the characteristic expression of RBP in higher-order association areas is mainly established postnatally.","Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Speciat Mech 1, Okazaki 4448585, Japan; RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Neural Architecture, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB); RIKEN","Yamamori, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Speciat Mech 1, Okazaki 4448585, Japan.","yamamori@nibb.ac.jp","Yamamori, Tetsuo/N-6536-2015","Yamamori, Tetsuo/0000-0001-5016-0078; Tochitani, Shiro/0000-0001-5765-3668",,,,,87,46,46,0,2,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

We report here that many of these deficits could be caused by an inability to actively regulate the position of the finger. Three macaques were trained to maintain the index finger in one position against constant or changing loads. Periodically, torque pulses were used to elicit reflexes in finger muscles. Following unilateral FC lesions, the monkeys failed to adjust finger position during the trials, and the normal M2 long-latency response was absent in the finger muscles. Performance on the task was impaired only in monkeys with complete lesions that included the deep ventral portion of the FC. These results suggest that afferent fibers in the FC regulate finger position, and do so partly through reflexive mechanisms.

Single cortical injections as well as multiple injections at distances of 1-2 mm with one tracer into an extended but coherent cortical region were applied. Fields with multiple injections were placed so that they touched each other (minimal distances 2 to 3 mm). Retrogradely labelled cells in the LGN and/or the pulvinar were arranged in coherent columns, volumes or slabs, but cell volumes resulting from neighbouring cortical injections overlapped at their border (for details of the thalamo-cortical topography see the companion paper Dick et al. (1991). Double labelled cells (dl) were only found in the zones of overlap of the cell volumes labelled by the respective tracers. The relative number of dl-cells in these overlap zones was 6.2 +/- 3.1%. The dl-frequency was the same in the various nuclei of the pulvinar and the LGN. In the main layers of LGN, dl-cells were found only in the overlap zone of two injection fields into area 17, but a few dl-cells were found in interlaminar cells after injections into area 17 and 18. Maximal cortical distances between injection fields which produced dl in the pulvinar, were 3 to exceptionally 4 mm but dl was highest at injection distances less-than-or-equal-to 2.5 mm and decreased sharply at wider distances. Such overlap zones were concerned with identical or overlapping regions of visual field representation in the cortex and probably also in the pulvinar. Although in individual experiments up to four different tracers were injected into different striate/prestriate regions, often embracing the same visual field representation, individual cells in the pulvinar showed dl from maximally only two tracers injected into neighbouring cortical regions. We conclude that dl in the posterior thalamic projection nuclei is determined essentially by cortical distance and thus reflects the local domain of branching of thalamo-cortical afferents. Pruning of such branches during development may further restrict bifurcating axons to identical visual field representations, but representation of identical visual field regions in different visual areas is not, per se, a sufficient condition for dl. It is not found if such regions are further apart from each other than the typical local domain of 2-3 mm, exceptionally up to 4 mm in one experiment after injections into area 17 and MT. D1 in the intralaminar nucleus CeL (5.0 +/- 4.6%), the claustrum (5.4 +/- 3.6%) and in the amygdala (5.7 +/- 1.9%) was of the same order as in the pulvinar and LGN. In the hypothalamus around 10% and in the Nucleus basalis Meynert 15.8% of the cells labelled by visual cortical injections were double labelled. In all these extrathalamic regions dl was also restricted to overlap zones, but overlap of labelled fields in these nuclei was much wider and included the whole striate/prestriate cortex except for some topographical separation of striate and prestriate projection zones in the claustrum. Only in the Nucl. basalis Meynert and the hypothalamus some cells were labelled by three tracers.","MAX PLANCK INST BIOPHYS CHEM, DEPT NEUROBIOL, POB 2841, W-3400 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY","Max Planck Society",,,,,,,,,43,15,15,0,2,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

A proposal is made that both the dorsal and ventral streams must be concurrently active to generate conscious awareness and that V1 (striate cortex) provides a serial link between them. An argument is presented against a true extrastriate communication between the dorsal and ventral streams. Secondly, a detailed theory is developed for the structure of the visual hierarchy. Premotor theory states that each organism-object interaction can be described by the two quantitative measures of torque and change in joint position served by the basal ganglia and cerebellum, respectively. This leads to a component theory of motor efference copy providing a fundamental toot for categorizing dorsal and ventral stream networks. The rationale for this is that the dorsal stream specifies spatial coordinates of the external world, which can be coded by the reafference of changes in joint position. The ventral stream is concerned with object recognition and is coded for by forces exerted on the world during a developmental exploratory phase of the organism. The proposed pathways for a component motor efference copy from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia converge on the thalamus and modulate thalamocortical projections via the thalamic reticular nucleus. The origin of the corticopontine projections, which are a massive pathway for cortical information to reach the cerebellum, coincides with the area typically considered as part of the dorsal stream, whereas the entire cortex projects to the striatum. This adds empirical support for a new conceptualization of the visual streams. The model also presents a solution to the binding problem of a neural correlate of consciousness, that is, how a distributed neural network synchronizes its activity during a cognitive event. It represents a reinterpretation of the current status of the visual hierarchy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a comparative approach, molecular markers and unique connectional patterns this study has uncovered the location and extent of possible rodent equivalent (A23 similar to) of the primate A23. A23 similar to but not adjoining areas in the rodents displays strong reciprocal connections with anteromedial thalamic nucleus.

Among cortico-pulvino-cortical systems, the connection between the middle temporal area (MT) and the pulvinar has been thought to contribute significantly to complex motion recognition. Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), has become a valuable model for a variety of neuroscience studies, including visual neuroscience and translational research of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, information on projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset brain is scant. We addressed this deficiency by injecting sensitive anterograde viral tracers into MT to examine the distribution of labeled terminations in the pulvinar. The injection sites were placed retinotopically according to visual field coordinates mapped by optical intrinsic imaging. All injections produced anterograde terminal labeling, which was densest in the medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (Plm), sparser in the central nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, and weakest in the lateral pulvinar. Within each subnucleus, terminations formed separate retinotopic fields. Most labeled terminals were small but these comingled with a few large terminals, distributed mainly in the dorsomedial part of the Plm. Our results further delineate the organization of projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset as forming parallel complex networks, which may differentially contribute to motion processing. It is interesting that the densest projections from MT target the Plm, the subnucleus recently reported to preferentially receive direct retinal projections. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effort of many neuroanatomists over the past has revealed the general outline of these connections; however, their function remains a mystery. Recently, combined physiological and anatomical approaches are beginning to reveal the role of these connections in the generation of cortical receptive fields. A common theme emerges from all these studies: cortical connections are remarkably specific and this specificity is determined in great extent by the type of connection and the neuronal response properties. Feedforward connections follow relatively rigid rules of wiring selectively targeting neurons with receptive fields matched in position and contrast polarity (thalamus --> cortical layer 4) or position and orientation selectivity (layer 4 --> layers 2 + 3). In contrast, horizontal connections follow more flexible rules connecting distant cells that are not retinotopically aligned and neighboring cells with different orientation preferences. These differences in connectivity may give a hint on how visual stimuli are processed in the primary visual cortex. An attractive hypothesis is that local stimuli use the highly selective feedforward inputs to reliably drive cortical neurons while background stimuli modulate their activity through more flexible horizontal (and feedback) connections.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","University of Connecticut",,"alonso@uconnvm.uconn.edu",,,,,,,129,23,23,0,11,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1073-8584","1089-4098",,"NEUROSCIENTIST","Neuroscientist","OCT",2002,8,5,,,,,443,456,,"10.1177/107385802236967","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107385802236967"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107385802236967"")",,,14,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","598CA",12374429,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000178256500017","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000178256500017"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The three principal cortical components of this network are located in the region of the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. We injected a retrogradely transported fluorescent dye into the frontal eye fields and another into the posterior parietal cortex of the monkey brain. Large numbers of neurons in the cingulate cortex were retrogradely labeled with each of the two fluorescent dyes. The two types of retrogradely labeled neurons were extensively intermingled, but neurons labeled with both tracers constituted less than 1 % of retrogradely labeled cingulate neurons. Other cortical areas that contained retrograde neuronal labeling included the premotor, lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, opercular, posterior parietal, lateral temporal, inferior temporal, parahippocampal, and insular regions. These areas contained neurons labeled with each of the two dyes but virtually no neurons labeled with both. In the thalamus, retrogradely labeled nuclei failed to display evidence of double labeling. The overlap between the two populations of retrogradely labeled neurons was far more extensive at the cortical than at the thalamic level.

This study provides the first causal evidence that RSC in macaque monkeys is crucial for postoperative retention of preoperatively and postoperatively acquired memories. Preoperatively, monkeys learned 300 object-in-place scene discriminations across sessions. After RSC removal, one-trial postoperative retention tests revealed significant retrograde memory loss for these 300 discriminations relative to unoperated control monkeys. Less robust evidence was found for a deficit in anterograde memory (new postoperative learning) after RSC lesions as new learning to criterion measures failed to reveal any significant learning impairment. However, after achieving a parts per thousand yen90% learning criterion for the postoperatively presented novel 100 object-in-place scene discriminations, short-term retention (i.e., measured after 24 h delay) of this well-learnt set was impaired in the RSC monkeys relative to controls. A further experiment assessed rapid within session acquisition of novel object-in-place scene discriminations, again confirming that new learning per se was unimpaired by bilateral RSC removal.

Recent work in the mouse and the monkey has discovered previously unknown classes of orientation-and direction-selective neurons in LGN. Furthermore, some recent studies in the mouse report that many LGN cells exhibit pronounced orientation biases that are of comparable strength to the subthreshold inputs to V1 neurons. These results raise the possibility that, in rodents, orientation biases of individual LGN cells make a substantial contribution to cortical orientation selectivity. Alternatively, the size and contribution of orientation-or direction-selective channels from LGN to V1 may vary across mammals. To address this question, we examined orientation and direction selectivity in LGN and V1 neurons of a highly visual diurnal rodent: the gray squirrel. In the representation of central vision, only a few LGN neurons exhibited strong orientation or direction selectivity. Across the population, LGN neurons showed weak orientation biases and were much less selective for orientation compared with V1 neurons. Although direction selectivity was weak overall, LGN layers 3abc, which contain neurons that express calbindin, exhibited elevated direction selectivity index values compared with LGN layers 1 and 2. These results suggest that, for central visual fields, the contribution of orientation-and directionselective channels from the LGN to V1 is small in the squirrel. As in other mammals, this small contribution is elevated in the calbindinpositive layers of the LGN","[Zaltsman, Julia B.; Van Hooser, Stephen D.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Biol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Van Hooser, Stephen D.] Brandeis Univ, Volen Ctr Complex Syst, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Van Hooser, Stephen D.] Brandeis Univ, Sloan Swartz Ctr Theoret Neurobiol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Heimel, J.

Because of the complexity of the connection data, analysis is required to unravel what principles of organization they imply. To date, analysis of laminar origin and termation connection data to reveal hierarchical relationships between the cortical areas has been the most widely acknowledged approach. We programmed a network processor that searches for optimal hierarchical orderings of cortical areas given known hierarchical constraints and rules for their interpretation. For all cortical systems and all cost functions, the processor found a multitude of equally low-cost hierarchies. Laminar hierarchical constraints that are presently available in the anatomical literature were therefore insufficient to constrain a unique ordering for any of the sensory systems we analysed. Hierarchical orderings of the monkey visual system that have been widely reported, but which were derived by hand, were not among the optimal orderings. All the cortical systems we studied displayed a significant degree of hierarchical organization, and the anatomical constraints from the monkey visual and somatomotor systems were satisfied with very few constraint violations in the optimal hierarchies. The visual and somato-motor systems in that animal were therefore surprisingly strictly hierarchical. Most inconsistencies between the constraints and the hierarchical relationships in the optimal structures for the visual system were related to connections of area FST (fundus of superior temporal sulcus). The found that the hierarchical solutions could be further improved by assuming that FST consists of two areas, which differ in the nature of their projections. Indeed, we found that perfect hierarchical arrangements of the primate visual system, without any violation of anatomical constraints, could be obtained under two reasonable conditions, namely the subdivision of FST into two distinct areas, whose connectivity we predict, and the abolition of at least one of the less reliable rule constraints. Our analyses showed that the future collection of the same type of laminar constraints, or the inclusion of new hierarchical constraints from thalamocortical connections, Mill not resolve the problem of multiple optimal hierarchical representations for the primate visual system. Further data, however, may help to specify the relative ordering of some more areas. This indeterminacy of the visual hierarchy is in part due to the reported absence of some connections between cortical areas. These absences are consistent with limited cross-talk between differentiated processing streams in the system. Hence, hierarchical representation of the visual system is affected by, and must take into account, other organizational features. such as processing streams.","Newcastle Univ, Dept Psychol, Neural Syst Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Newcastle University - UK","Hilgetag, CC (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 700 Albany St,W746, Boston, MA 02118 USA.","claush@bu.edu","Hilgetag, Claus C/AAH-1760-2020; Hilgetag, Claus C/L-7282-2013","Hilgetag, Claus C/0000-0003-2129-8910; Hilgetag, Claus C/0000-0003-2129-8910",,,,,37,113,116,0,7,"ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8436","1471-2970",,"PHILOS T R SOC B","Philos.

At single-joint level this is accompanied by reduced inhibition of antagonist muscle activity. While normal basal ganglia (BG) contributions to motor control include selecting appropriate muscles by inhibiting others, it is unclear how PD-related changes in BG function cause impaired movement initiation and inhibition at single-joint level. To further elucidate these changes we studied 4 right-hand movement tasks with fMRI, by dissociating activations related to abrupt movement initiation, inhibition and gradual movement modulation. Initiation and inhibition were inferred from ballistic and stepwise interrupted movement, respectively, while smooth wrist circumduction enabled the assessment of gradually modulated movement. Task-related activations were compared between PD patients (N = 12) and healthy subjects (N = 18). In healthy subjects, movement initiation was characterized by antero-ventral striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and premotor activations while inhibition was dominated by subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pallidal activations, in line with the known role of these areas in simple movement. Gradual movement mainly involved antero-dorsal putamen and pallidum. Compared to healthy subjects, patients showed reduced striatal/SN and increased pallidal activation for initiation, whereas for inhibition STN activation was reduced and striatal-thalamo-cortical activation increased. For gradual movement patients showed reduced pallidal and increased thalamo-cortical activation. We conclude that PD-related changes during movement initiation fit the (rather static) model of alterations in direct and indirect BG pathways. Reduced STN activation and regional cortical increased activation in PD during inhibition and gradual movement modulation are better explained by a dynamic model that also takes into account enhanced responsiveness to external stimuli in this disease and the effects of hyper-fluctuating cortical inputs to the striatum and STN in particular.","[Toxopeus, Carolien M.; Maurits, Natasha M.; Leenders, Klaus L.; de Jong, Bauke M.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Neurol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Valsan, Gopal; Conway, Bernard A.] Univ Strathclyde, Bioengn Unit, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland","University of Groningen; University of Strathclyde","Toxopeus, CM (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Neurol, Groningen, Netherlands.","c.m.toxopeus@umcg.nl","Conway, Bernard A/A-9625-2016","Conway, Bernard A/0000-0002-0069-0131; Maurits, Natasha/0000-0001-6231-7044; de Jong, Bauke M./0000-0002-6568-5739","International Parkinson Foundation","International Parkinson Foundation","This study was sponsored with a grant from the International Parkinson Foundation, grant title: Initiation and Inhibition of Movement in patients with Parkinson's disease: New Insights Using a Direct Coupling Between Movement, Muscle and Brain Activity.

These areas received connections from the same set of thalamic nuclei, including main inputs from the ventral lateral and ventral anterior complexes, but differed in their patterns of corticocortical connections. Areas 8C and 6Va had reciprocal interconnections, and received similar proportions of afferents from premotor areas 6M and 6DC, and from the prefrontal cortex. However, area 8C received stronger inputs from frontal areas that have been implicated in oculomotor functions, whereas area 6Va received stronger projections from the primary motor area. Somatosensory projections to area 6Va were generally stronger than those to area 8C, and originated from several areas; in contrast, only the second somatosensory area (S2) sent major inputs to area 8C. Finally, although both 6Va and 8C received major inputs from the rostral posterior parietal cortex (putative homologs of areas PE, PF, and PFG), area 8C also received a variety of smaller connections from posterior midline, caudal posterior parietal, and extrastriate areas. Statistical analyses revealed that the pattern of connections of area 8C is more akin to that characterizing a premotor area, rather than a prefrontal area. We conclude that cytoarchitectural area 6Va in the marmoset is similar to ventral premotor areas identified in other simian primates, and that area 8C corresponds to a specialized subdivision of the caudal premotor complex where visual information for the guidance of movements is likely to be emphasized.

The ACC pathway terminated mostly in areas 28 and 35 with a high proportion of large terminals, whereas the pOFC pathway terminated mostly through small terminals in area 36 and sparsely in areas 28 and 35. Both pathways terminated in all layers. Simultaneous labeling of pathways and distinct neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons, followed by analyses of appositions of presynaptic and postsynaptic fluorescent signal, or synapses, showed overall predominant association with spines of putative excitatory neurons, but also significant interactions with presumed inhibitory neurons labeled for calretinin, calbindin, or parvalbumin. In the upper layers of areas 28 and 35 the ACC pathway was associated with dendrites of neurons labeled with calretinin, which are thought to disinhibit neighboring excitatory neurons, suggesting facilitated hippocampal access. In contrast, in area 36 pOFC axons were associated with dendrites of calbindin neurons, which are poised to reduce noise and enhance signal. In the deep layers, both pathways innervated mostly dendrites of parvalbumin neurons, which strongly inhibit neighboring excitatory neurons, suggesting gating of hippocampal output to other cortices. These findings suggest that the ACC, associated with attention and context, and the pOFC, associated with emotional valuation, have distinct contributions to memory in rhinal cortices, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.

The development of ocular dominance bands was studied by transneuronal labeling of the visual cortices of ferret kits between the ages of postnatal day 28 (P28) and P81 after intravitreous injections of either tritiated proline or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. Laminar specificity was evident in the youngest animals studied and was similar to that in the adult by P50. In P28 and P30 ferret kits, no modulation reminiscent of ocular dominance bands was detectable in the pattern of labeling along layer IV. By P37 a slight fluctuation in the density of labeling in layer TV was evident in serial reconstructions. By P50, the amplitude of modulation had increased considerably but the pattern of ocular dominance bands did not yet appear mature. The pattern and degree of modulation of the ocular dominance bands resembled that in adult animals by P63. Flat mounts of cortex and serial reconstructions of layer IV revealed an unusual arrangement of inputs serving the two eyes in the region rostral to the periodic ocular dominance bands. In this region, inputs serving the contralateral eye were commonly fused along a mediolateral axis, rostral to which were large and sometimes fused patches of ipsilateral input. J. Comp.

However, in contrast to the extensive studies that have been carried out on the latter area, only a few taste units in the former area have been recorded. To clarify gustatory coding in area 3, we investigated the taste response properties of neurons in area 3 compared with those in area G in alert monkeys by infiltrating into their mouths seven taste stimuli [0.3 M sucrose (S), 0.1 M NaCl (N), 0.01 N HCl (H), 0.003 M quinine-HCl (Q), 0.1 M monosodium glutamate (MSG), distilled water (W), and orange juice (OR)] and artificial saliva (SA). A larger number of HCl-best units and a smaller number of quinine-best units were found in area 3 than in area G. The onset latency and response duration were significantly shorter in area 3 than in area G. Weighted multi-dimensional scaling showed that area G divided eight stimulants into four classes, i.e. two groups (H-Q-W and S-MSG-OR), N and SA, whereas area 3 divided them into three classes (N-MSG-W-OR, S-Q, and H-SA). This suggested that tastants not separated in area G were separated in area 3, and vice versa. This indicates that both areas complement each other in the representation of taste stimuli, each contributing to taste information processing in a different manner.","Kumamoto Univ, Fac Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Sensory & Cognit Physiol, Kumamoto 8608556, Japan","Kumamoto University","Hirata, S (corresponding author), Kumamoto Univ, Fac Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Sensory & Cognit Physiol, Honjo 1-1-1, Kumamoto 8608556, Japan.","shin-kuma@umin.ac.jp",,,,,,,38,13,13,0,0,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Recently, increased attention has focused on using microstimulation to restore functions as diverse as somatosensation and memory. However, how microstimulation changes the neural substrate is still not fully understood. Microstimulation may cause cortical changes that could either compete with or complement natural neural processes, and could result in neuroplastic changes rendering the region dysfunctional or even epileptic. As part of our efforts to produce neuroprosthetic devices and to further study the effects of microstimulation on the cortex, we stimulated and recorded from microelectrode arrays in the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (area 1) in two awake macaque monkeys. We applied a simple neuroprosthetic microstimulation protocol to a pair of electrodes in the area 1 array, using either random pulses or pulses time-locked to the recorded spiking activity of a reference neuron. This setup was replicated using a computer model of the thalamocortical system, which consisted of 1980 spiking neurons distributed among six cortical layers and two thalamic nuclei. Experimentally, we found that spike-triggered microstimulation induced cortical plasticity, as shown by increased unit-pair mutual information, while random microstimulation did not. In addition, there was an increased response to touch following spike-triggered microstimulation, along with decreased neural variability. The computer model successfully reproduced both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the experimental findings.

Macaque pulvinar includes two subregions that are connected to the visual cortex and are retinotopically organized, but the organizing principles of the visual portions of the human pulvinar are unknown. We employed two tasks to address the question of whether human pulvinar exhibits spatial organization using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The first was a global-motion discrimination with a rich visual stimulus and the second a luminance-discrimination task of similar difficulty that used a minimal visual stimulus. Both tasks required central fixation and covert peripheral attention. A group analysis of blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses elicited in the motion-discrimination task revealed activity bilaterally in the ventral pulvinar (z = 2 in Talairach space). Clear position specificity was observed with activity elicited only by contralateral stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli caused suppression. This locus of activity is distinct from the more dorsal (z = 10) region of the pulvinar that has previously been reported to be visually responsive but not retinotopic. In the luminance-discrimination task, similar activity was seen, but it was weaker and detectable only in the left pulvinar. In additional experiments with no task, passively viewed global-motion stimuli also activated the ventral pulvinar bilaterally. Our results show for the first time a distinct, bilateral visual representation in human inferior pulvinar that appears to be contralaterally organized.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","University of London; Royal Holloway University London","Smith, AT (corresponding author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.","a.t.smith@rhul.ac.uk",,"Smith, Andrew T/0000-0002-4751-6253",,,,,38,39,39,0,5,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Materials and methods: Eight patients with medication-refractory ET were treated with tcMRgFUS targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Diffusion and structural MRI data and clinical evaluations were acquired pre-treatment and post-treatment. To identify the optimal target location, tractography was performed on pre-treatment diffusion MRI data between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus. The tractography-identified locations were compared to the lesion location delineated on 1 year post-treatment T-2-weighted MR image. Their overlap was correlated with the clinical outcomes measured by the percentage change of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores acquired pre-treatment, as well as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment. Results: The probabilistic tractography was consistent from subject-to-subject and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract. Higher overlap between the tractography-identified location and the tcMRgFUS treatment-induced lesion highly correlated with better treatment outcome (r=-0.929, -0.75, -0.643, p=0.00675, 0.0663, 0.139 for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus, respectively, at 1 year post-treatment). The correlation for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex is the highest for all time points (r=-0.719, -0.976, -0.707, -0.929, p=0.0519, 0.000397, 0.0595, 0.00675 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment, respectively).

Previously, this antibody has been found to label neurons associated with the Y-cell stream of processing in cats and the magnocellular or M-cell stream in macaque monkeys. In tree shrews, the antibody selectively labeled layers 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, layers that are likely to contain neurons previously classified as Y-cells. Of the two layers that contain W-cells, layer 3 was unlabeled and layer 6 was lightly labeled. In area 17, layer 3c was densely stained, as in cats and macaque monkeys. The external half of layer 5 was also densely stained, in contrast to cats where the internal half of layer 5 is stained and macaques where layer 5 is sparsely stained. Area 18 was characterized by dense, uniform staining of inner layer 3 and outer layer 5, but no pattern of alternating light and dense bands crossed the width of area 18 as in macaques. Dense labeling of these same sublayers occurred in cortical areas TA and TD just lateral to area 18. Area TD may be the homologue of area MT of primates, which also stains densely with Cat-301 in macaques. These results indicate that Cat-301 differentially labels layers and areas in the visual system of tree shrews, and raise intriguing issues of comparison among tree shrews, primates, and cats.","VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240","Vanderbilt University",,,"Preuss, Todd/GSI-6571-2022; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010","Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850","NEI NIH HHS [EY02686] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,69,26,26,0,1,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211","0952-5238",,,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","JUL-AUG",1994,11,4,,,,,731,741,,"10.1017/S0952523800003035","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800003035"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800003035"")",,,11,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","NT650",7918223,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1994NT65000009","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1994NT65000009"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

T(1)-weighted coronal, horizontal, and sagittal MR slices of fixed left cerebral hemispheres were obtained from one male fetus at embryonic days (EDs) 70-150. The timetable for fetal sulcation by MRI was in good agreement with that by gross observations, with a lag time of 10-30 days. A difference in detectability of some sulci seemed to be associated with the length, depth, width, and location of the sulci. Furthermore, MRI clarified the embryonic days of the emergence of the callosal (ED 70) and circular (ED 90) sulci, which remained unpredictable under gross observations. Also made visible by the present MRI were subcortical structures of the forebrain such as the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, major subdivisions of the thalamus, and hippocampal formation. Their adult-like features were formed by ED 100, corresponding to the onset of a signal enhancement in the gray matter, which reflects neuronal maturation. The results reveal a highly reproducible level of gross structural changes in the forebrain using a high spatial 7-tesla MRI. The present MRI study clarified some changes that are difficult to demonstrate nondestructively using only gross observations, for example, the development of cerebral sulci located on the deep portions of the cortex, as well as cortical and subcortical neuronal maturation.","[Sawada, Kazuhiko] Tsukuba Int Univ, Anat Lab, Dept Phys Therapy, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 3000051, Japan; [Sun, Xue-Zhi] Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Regulat Sci Res Grp, Chiba 2638555, Japan; [Fukunishi, Katsuhiro; Kashima, Masatoshi; Tokado, Hiroshi] Shin Nippon Biomed Labs, Kagoshima 8911394, Japan; [Sakata-Haga, Hiromi; Fukui, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokushima, Dept Anat & Dev Neurobiol, Grad Sch, Inst Hlth Biosci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Aoki, Ichio] Natl Inst Radiol Sci, MR Mol Imaging Team, Mol Imaging Ctr, Chiba 2638555, Japan","National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology; Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories Ltd.; Tokushima University; National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology","Sawada, K (corresponding author), Tsukuba Int Univ, Anat Lab, Dept Phys Therapy, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 3000051, Japan.","k-sawada@tius-hs.jp","Aoki, Ichio/ABF-7336-2020; Sawada, Kazuhiko/AAV-3923-2020; Aoki, Ichio/G-2529-2011","Aoki, Ichio/0000-0002-4429-5053","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [20590176]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20590176] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (20590176) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

Nonetheless, the way cerebellar information is integrated with motor cortical commands and affects their temporal properties remains unclear. To address this issue, we activated the CTC system in primates and found that it efficiently recruits motor cortical cells; however, the cortical response was dominated by prolonged inhibition that imposed a directional activation across the motor cortex. During task performance, cortical cells that integrated CTC information fired synchronous bursts at movement onset. These cells expressed a stronger correlation with reaction time than non-CTC cells. Thus, the excitation-inhibition interplay triggered by the CTC system facilitates transient recruitment of a cortical subnetwork at movement onset.

Three rhesus monkeys were given repeated single boluses of [C-11]DASB in sequential positron emission tomography (PET) experiments. Rats were given the tracer as a bolus dose plus a constant infusion. In vivo binding in both models was studied before and after presumably having increased interstitial 5HT concentrations using tranylcypromine (TCP), which inhibits the enzyme (monoamine oxidase, MAO), that degrades 5HT. The rat brain tissue was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the proportion of the PET signal comprising unchanged [C-11]DASB. The binding of [C-11]DASB in the thalamus decreased in both rhesus monkeys and rats after TCP administration. The possibility of using [C-11]DASB as a tool for monitoring changes in endogenous serotonin concentrations merits further investigation.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacokinet & Drug Therapy, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Imanet, SE-75109 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Uppsala Hosp, Hosp Pharm, SE-75185 Uppsala, Sweden","Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University Hospital","Lundquist, P (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Div Pharmacokinet & Drug Therapy, Box 591, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.","pinelopi.lundquist@farmbio.uu.se",,"Syvanen, Stina/0000-0002-8196-4041",,,,,46,20,20,0,2,"WILEY-LISS","HOBOKEN","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","0887-4476",,,"SYNAPSE","Synapse","JUN",2007,61,6,,,,,440,449,,"10.1002/syn.20382","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/syn.20382"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/syn.20382"")",,,10,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","154VB",17372973,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000245534800009","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000245534800009"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The most common motor complications consist in wearing-off fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements appearing when plasma levels of L-dopa are high, commonly referred to as peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Parkinsonian models exhibiting these features have been well-characterized in both rodent and nonhuman primate species. The first animal models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia were produced in monkeys lesioned with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and treated chronically with L-dopa to elicit choreic movements and dystonic postures. Seminal studies were performed in these models using both metabolic mapping and electrophysiological techniques, providing fundamental pathophysiological insights that have stood the test of time. A decade later, it was shown possible to reproduce peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in rats and mice rendered parkinsonian with nigrostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. When treated with L-dopa, these animals exhibit abnormal involuntary movements having both hyperkinetic and dystonic components. These models have enabled molecular- and cellular-level investigations into the mechanisms of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. A flourishing literature using genetically engineered mice is now unraveling the role of specific genes and neural circuits in the development of L-dopa-induced motor complications. Both non-human primate and rodent models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia have excellent construct validity and provide valuable tools for discovering therapeutic targets and evaluating potential treatments.

However, there are only a limited number of ligands that can measure the low-density D, receptor in extrastriatal regions and their sensitivity to endogenous dopamine in extrastriatal regions has not yet been fully examined. In this study, the effect of endogenous dopamine on the extrastriatal binding of [C-11]FLB 457 was examined in the rhesus monkey after facilitation with 1 mg/kg of methamphetamine (MAP) and was compared with the effect on the striatal binding of [C-11]raclopride. The indices of receptor binding were obtained by four methods using cerebellum as a reference region. The bindings of [C-11]FLB 457 in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus were not significantly changed after MAP treatment, while the striatal binding of [C-11]raclopride was decreased by more than 20%. These results suggest that [C-11]FLB 457 is not sensitive to endogenous dopamine in the extrastriatal regions of rhesus monkeys, despite a sufficient dose of MAP to decrease the binding of [C-11]raclopride in the striatum.

Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On-Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On-Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On-Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On-Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.","[Dhande, Onkar S.; Stafford, Benjamin K.; El-Danaf, Rana; Phan, Ann H.; Nguyen, Phong L.; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 299 Campus Dr West, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Euler, Thomas; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Euler, Thomas; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Neurosci Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, BioX, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Franke, Katrin; Berens, Philipp] Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Franke, Katrin; Berens, Philipp] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Percival, Kumiko A.; Taylor, W.

There is convincing evidence that the two cortical systems function as complementary systems in normal cognition, including learning and memory, and that disruption of the interplay between the two lead to profound deficits. On the basis of our own experimental anatomical data in the rat, we suggest that this interplay is mediated by at least three direct and indirect parallel pathways. The first one makes use of direct projections from the hippocampal formation to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as parallel indirect routes through the parahippocampal region. The second pathway comprises the connections of both domains with intrinsically connected parts of the posterior and anterior cingular cortices. Finally, the strong and rather specific reciprocal connections with certain midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei form a third pathway for hippocampal-prefrontal systems to interact. Lesions disrupting any of these three routes lead to specific learning and memory deficits both in experimental animals as well as in humans, supporting the functional relevance of each of these pathways.

Their role in planning novel, as compared to overlearned movement patterns is as yet not well defined. We tested for the involvement of the associative striatum (caudate/anterior putamen) in the generation of novel movement patterns, which is a critical cognitive requirement for non-routine motor behavior. Using event related functional MRI in 14 right-handed male subjects, we analyzed brain activity in the planning phase of four digit finger sequences. Subjects either executed a single overlearned four digit sequence (RECALL), or self-determined four digit sequences of varying order (GENERATE). In both conditions, RECALL and GENERATE, planning was associated with activation in mesial/lateral premotor cortices, motor cingulate cortex, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, insula, thalamus, and midbrain nuclei. When contrasting the planning phase of GENERATE with the planning phase of RECALL, there was significantly higher activation within this distributed network. At the level of the basal ganglia, the planning phase of GENERATE was associated with differentially higher activation located specifically within the associative striatum bilaterally. On the other hand, the execution phase during both conditions was associated with a shift of activity towards the posterior part of the putamen. Our data show the specific involvement of the associative striatum during the planning of non-routine movement patterns and illustrate the propagation of activity from rostral to dorsal basal ganglia sites during different stages of motor processing.

We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the BG-PFC interplay. We propose that the BG bias PFC activity by removing the inhibition of cortico-thalamo-cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the PFC. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the BG with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico-BG-cortical loops.","[Villagrasa, Francesc; Baladron, Javier; Vitay, Julien; Schroll, Henning; Hamker, Fred H.] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Comp Sci, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany; [Antzoulatos, Evan G.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Antzoulatos, Evan G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Technische Universitat Chemnitz; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwell Health; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Hamker, FH (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Comp Sci, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany.","fred.hamker@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de","Miller, Earl K./AAE-8187-2019","Miller, Earl K./0000-0002-0582-6958; Baladron, Javier/0000-0003-4084-4905","German Research Foundation (DFG) [HA2630/4-2, HA2630/8-1]; European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony [ESF-100269974]; National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health [R01MH065252]; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund; NIMH [R37MH087027]","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony; National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund; NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG Grants HA2630/4-2 and HA2630/8-1), the European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony (Grant ESF-100269974), the National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health (Grant R01MH065252), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund and NIMH R37MH087027.",,52,19,19,0,8,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Design.-Case series of patients with TLE who underwent interictal fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, compared quantitatively with normal positron emission tomography. Setting.-Patients referred for surgical treatment of medically refractory complex partial seizures. Patients and Other Participants.-Ten normal volunteers; 27 patients with TLE selected to exclude seizures of bilateral temporal or extratemporal onset. Results.-Regional hypometabolism occurred in 25 patients. Hypometabolic regions were ipsilateral to seizure onset and included lateral temporal (in 78% of patients), mesial temporal (70%), thalamic (63%), basal ganglial (41%), frontal (30%), parietal (26%), and occipital (4%). Specific patterns of temporal and extratemporal hypometabolism varied considerably across the TLE group. Conclusions.-Any of the previously reported anatomic areas of hypometabolism can occur in individual patients with TLE. The prevalence of thalamic hypometabolism suggests a pathophysiologic role for the thalamus in initiation or propagation of temporal lobe seizures or in the interictal cognitive dysfunction of TLE.","UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,SCH MED,DEPT RADIOL SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA","HENRY, TR (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48104, USA.",,"Henry, Thomas/X-1756-2019","Henry, Thomas/0000-0002-5708-903X","NINDS NIH HHS [NS-15654, NS-02808] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,52,225,227,0,3,"AMER MEDICAL ASSOC","CHICAGO","515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610","0003-9942",,,"ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO","Arch.

Although the anatomical and functional organization of the pulvinar has been extensively studied in old and new world monkeys, little is known about the organization of the human pulvinar. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, we identified two visual field maps within the ventral pulvinar, referred to as vPul1 and vPul2. Both maps contain an inversion of contralateral visual space with the upper visual field represented ventrally and the lower visual field represented dorsally. vPul1 and vPul2 border each other at the vertical meridian and share a representation of foveal space with iso-eccentricity lines extending across areal borders. Additional, coarse representations of contralateral visual space were identified within ventral medial and dorsal lateral portions of the pulvinar. Connectivity analyses on functional and diffusion imaging data revealed a strong distinction in thalamocortical connectivity between the dorsal and ventral pulvinar. The two maps in the ventral pulvinar were most strongly connected with early and extrastriate visual areas. Given the shared eccentricity representationandsimilarity in cortical connectivity, we propose that these two maps form a distinct visual field map cluster and perform related functions. The dorsal pulvinar was most strongly connected with parietal and frontal areas. The functional and anatomical organization observed within the human pulvinar was similar to the organization of the pulvinar in other primate species.","Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Princeton University; Princeton University","Arcaro, MJ (corresponding author), Princeton Neurosci Inst, Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","marcaro@princeton.edu","Arcaro, Michael/H-8964-2019","Arcaro, Michael/0000-0002-4612-9921; Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X","National Institutes of Health [R01MH-064043, R01EY-017699, T90DA-022763]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1328270] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01MH-064043, R01EY-017699, and T90DA-022763.

These zones are at the origin of parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical subloops involved in modulating the cortical motor output. However, it is still largely unknown how parietal and prefrontal areas, connected to premotor areas, and involved in controlling higher order aspects of motor control, project to the basal ganglia. Based on tracer injections at the cortical level, we analyzed the corticostriatal projections of the macaque hand-related ventrolateral prefrontal, ventral premotor, and inferior parietal areas forming a network for controlling purposeful hand actions (lateral grasping network). The results provided evidence for partial overlap or interweaving of these projections in correspondence of 2 putaminal zones, distinct from the motor putamen, one located just rostral to the anterior commissure, the other in the caudal and ventral part. Thus, the present data provide evidence for partial overlap or interweaving in specific striatal zones (input channels) of projections from multiple, even remote, areas taking part in a large-scale functionally specialized cortical network. Furthermore, they suggest the presence of multiple hand-related input channels, possibly differentially involved in controlling goal-directed hand actions.","[Gerbella, Marzio; Borra, Elena; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Gerbella, Marzio] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Brain Ctr Social & Motor Cognit, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Mangiaracina, Chiara] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Biomed Biotecnol & Traslaz SBiBi, I-43100 Parma, Italy","University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Parma","Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.","luppino@unipr.it","Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019","Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2010MEFNF7_005]; European Commission [FP7-250013]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)","The work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (grant number: PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005), European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013, and Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11.",,76,29,30,2,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Noting their connections with the basal ganglia, the locomotor disturbances that occur following lesions of the PPN or cMRF, and the encouraging results of PPN deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, both the PPN and cMRF have been linked to motor control. In order to determine the existence of and characterize vestibular responses in the PPN and cMRF, we recorded single neurons from both structures during vertical and horizontal rotation, translation, and visual pursuit stimuli. The majority of PPN cells (72.5%) were vestibular-only (VO) cells that responded exclusively to rotation and translation stimuli but not visual pursuit. Visual pursuit responses were much more prevalent in the cMRF (57.1%) though close to half of cMRF cells were VO cells (41.1%). Directional preferences also differed between the PPN, which was preferentially modulated during nose-down pitch, and cMRF, which was preferentially modulated during ipsilateral yaw rotation. Finally, amplitude responses were similar between the PPN and cMRF during rotation and pursuit stimuli, but PPN responses to translation were of higher amplitude than cMRF responses. Taken together with their connections to the vestibular circuit, these results implicate the PPN and cMRF in the processing of vestibular stimuli and suggest important roles for both in responding to motion perturbations like falls and turns.

We have identified, using non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry, that D-3 mRNA-positive neurons are highly concentrated in the ventral striatum, efferents of the ventral striatum (globus pallidus internal, ventral palladium, substantia nigra pars reticulata), and in regions projecting to the ventral striatum (medial dorsal thalamus, nucleus basalis, extended amygdala). DQ receptors are also highly enriched in the limbic striatal-pallidal-thalamic loop, exhibiting segregation from the D-2 receptor-enriched motor loop. This supports data developed in rats showing that the D-3 receptor is a target of the mesolimbic DA system that can modulate the limbic striato-palladial-thalamic Loop. However, D-2 and D-3 receptors and their mRNAs are co-localized in many sensory regions (lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, basolateral and basomedial amygdala, regions of thalamus), suggesting mechanisms of cross-talk, We have also demonstrated that there are 35% elevations in D-3 receptor number in ventral striatal neurons and their striatopalladial targets in schizophrenics that is reduced by concurrent antipsychotic treatment. Chronic haloperidol treatment to rats for 6 months with a 2-month withdrawal does not result in elevated D-3 receptor number. We hypothesize that antipsychotic treatment via D-3 receptors returns balance to limbic efferents of the ventral striatum. We established that early neonatal damage to the nigrostriatal DA system in rats produces characteristic adaptations in the pre- and post-synaptic components of the mesolimbic DA system that can provide a model to explore regulation by antipsychotics. This includes elevated release of DA from the mesolimbic DA terminals, elevated D-3 receptor mRNA in the Islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens, and enhanced behavioral response to psychostimulants.","Sun Hlth Res Inst, Christopher Ctr Parkinsons Dis Res, Sun City, AZ 85351 USA","Banner Research; Banner Health; Banner Sun Health Research Institute","Joyce, JN (corresponding author), Sun Hlth Res Inst, Christopher Ctr Parkinsons Dis Res, 10515 W Santa Fe Dr, Sun City, AZ 85351 USA.","jjoyce@mail.sunhealth.org",,"Joyce, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0131-0946","NIA NIH HHS [AG 09215] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH 56824] Funding Source: Medline","NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,61,40,43,0,3,"NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES","NEW YORK","2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",,,"1-57331-179-0; 1-57331-178-2","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,1999,877,,,,,,595,613,,"10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09291.x","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09291.x"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09291.x"")",,,19,"Substance Abuse; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Substance Abuse; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry","BN31Y",10415673,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000081586500034","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000081586500034"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

It has been implicated in human disorders of social and emotional behavior, such as autism. Of the interconnected functional networks, considerable research in rodents and primates has focused on connections between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The amygdala projects to OFC by both a direct amygdalocortical (AC) pathway and an indirect pathway through mediodorsal thalamus. In the rat, retrograde tracer experiments indicate that the AC and amygdalothalamic (AT) pathways originate from separate populations, and may therefore convey distinctive infonnation, although the characteristics of these pathways remain unclear. To investigate this issue in monkeys we made anterograde tracer injections in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC; n = 3). Three distinctive features were found preferentially associated with the AT or AC pathways. First, AT terminations are large (average diameter = 3.5 mu m; range = 1.2-7.0 mu m) and cluster around proximal dendrites, in contrast with small-bouton AC terminations. Second, AT terminations form small arbors (diameter approximate to 0.1 mm), while AC are widely divergent (often > 1.0 mm long). The AT terminations features are reminiscent of large bouton, driver corticothalamic terminations. Finally, AC but not AT terminations are positive for zinc (Zn), a neuromodulator associated with synaptic plasticity. From these results we suggest that AC and AT terminations originate from distinct populations in monkey as well as in rodent. Further work is necessary to determine the degree and manner of their segregation and how these subsystems interact within a broader connectivity network.","RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Sakura Ku, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan","RIKEN; Kyoto University; Saitama University","Miyashita, T (corresponding author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.","toshio@brain.riken.jp",,"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785",,,,,91,32,32,0,3,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

The density of D-1 receptors, VMAT2, and DAT was measured using [H-3]SCH23390, [H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [H-3]WIN35428, respectively. The density of D-2 and D-3 receptors was calculated using the D-3-preferring radioligand, [H-3] WC-10 and the D-2-preferring radioligand [H-3]raclopride using a mathematical model developed previously by our group. Dopamine D-1, D-2, and D-3 receptors are extensively distributed throughout striatum; the highest density of D-3 receptors occurred in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The density of the DAT is 10-20-fold lower than that of VMAT2 in striatal regions. Dopamine D-3 receptor density exceeded D-2 receptor densities in extrastriatal regions, and thalamus contained a high level of D-3 receptors with negligible D-2 receptors. The density of dopamine D-1 linearly correlated with D-3 receptor density in the thalamus. The density of the DAT was negligible in the extrastriatal regions whereas the VMAT2 was expressed in moderate density. D-3 receptor and VMAT2 densities were in similar level between the aged human and aged rhesus brain samples, whereas aged human brain samples had lower range of densities of D-1 and D-2 receptors and DAT compared with the aged rhesus monkey brain. The differential density of D-3 and D-2 receptors in human brain will be useful in the interpretation of PET imaging studies in human subjects with existing radiotracers, and assist in the validation of newer PET radiotracers having a higher selectivity for dopamine D-2 or D-3 receptors.","[Sun, Jianjun; Xu, Jinbin; Perlmutter, Joel S.; Mach, Robert H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cairns, Nigel J.; Perlmutter, Joel S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cairns, Nigel J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Immunol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Perlmutter, Joel S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Perlmutter, Joel S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Occupat Therapy, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Perlmutter, Joel S.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Phys Therapy, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mach, Robert H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol amd Physiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)","Mach, RH (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","rhmach@mir.wustl.edu","Cairns, Nigel/AAB-9713-2020; Xu, Jinbin/ABG-1280-2020","Cairns, Nigel/0000-0001-9858-3344; Xu, Jinbin/0000-0002-2120-8287; Mach, Robert/0000-0002-7645-2869","NIH [MH081281, DA29840, NS075321, P50 AG05681]; American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA); Greater St. Louis Chapter of the APDA; Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation; Charles and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Research Initiative of the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA); Greater St. Louis Chapter of the APDA; Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation; Charles and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Research Initiative of the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center","This study was supported by NIH grants MH081281, DA29840, NS075321 and P50 AG05681, the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA), the Greater St. Louis Chapter of the APDA, the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation (Elliot Stein Family Fund and Parkinson Disease Research Fund) and the Charles and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Research Initiative of the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

While some memory inadequacies in OSA may result from earlier-described structural deficits in the hippocampus, mammillary body injury also could contribute, since these structures receive projections from the hippocampus via the fornix, project heavily to the anterior thalamus, and have been implicated in other conditions with memory deficiencies, such as Korsakoff's syndrome. However, volume loss in mammillary bodies has not been reported in OSA, likely a consequence of logistic difficulties in size assessment. We evaluated mammillary body volumes in 43 OSA (mean age +/- S.D., 46.9 +/- 9.2 years; mean apnea-hypopnea-index +/- S.D., 31.2 +/- 19.9 events/h) and 66 control subjects (age, 47.3 +/- 8.9 years). Two high-resolution T1-weighted image volumes were collected on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner, averaged to improve signal-to-noise, and reoriented (without warping) into a common space. Brain sections containing both mammillary bodies were oversampled, and the bodies were manually traced and volumes calculated. OSA patients showed significantly reduced left, right, and combined mammillary body volumes compared with control subjects, after partitioning for age, gender, and head size (multivariate linear model, p < 0.05). Left-side mammillary bodies showed greater volume reduction than the right side. Diminished mammillary body volume in OSA patients may be associated with memory and spatial orientation deficits found in the syndrome. The mechanisms contributing to the volume loss are unclear, but may relate to hypoxic/ischemic processes, possibly assisted by nutritional deficiencies in the syndrome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

NTAR is composed of two modules. The neuroanatomical term extraction (NTE) module employs a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with lexical rules to extract neuroanatomical terms (NT) and acronyms (NA) from textual material. The output of the NTE is formatted into collections of term- or acronym-indexed documents composed of sentences and word phrases extracted from textual material. The second information retrieval (IR) module utilizes a vector space model (VSM) and includes a novel, automated relevance feedback algorithm. The IR module retrieves statistically related neuroanatomical terms and acronyms in response to queried neuroanatomical terms and acronyms. Neuroanatomical terms and acronyms retrieval obtained from term-based inquiries were compared with (1) term retrieval obtained by including automated relevance feedback and with (2) term retrieval using document-to-document comparisons (context-based VSM). The retrieval of synonymous and similar primate and macaque thalamic terms and acronyms in response to a query list of human thalamic terminology by these three IR approaches was compared against a previously published, manually constructed concordance table of homologous cross-species terms and acronyms. Term-based VSM with automated relevance feedback retrieved 70% and 80% of these primate and macaque terms and acronyms, respectively, listed in the concordance table.

The licensed HFMD vaccine targets EV-A71 without cross-protection against CV-A16. Thus, a CV-A16 vaccine is needed. In this study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live attenuated CV-A16 candidate, K168-8Ac, were evaluated in a rhesus monkey model. Four passages of this strain (P35, P50, P60, and P70) were administered to monkeys, and its protective effect was identified. The immunized monkeys were clinically asymptomatic, except for slight fever. Weak viraemia was observed, and two doses of vaccination were found to significantly reduce virus shedding. High levels of antibody responses were observed (1:1024-1:2048), along with a significant increase in plasma IL-8. The I.M. group showed a much stronger humoural immunity. Pathological damage was detected mainly in lung tissues, although thalamus, spinal cord, lymph nodes, and livers were involved. After the viral challenge, it was found that two doses of vaccine reduced virus shedding, and the degree of lung damage and the number of organs involved decreased as the passage number increased. Overall, a robust immune response and partial protection against CV-A16, triggered by the K168-8Ac strain, were demonstrated. This study provides valuable data for CV-A16 vaccine development.","[Yang, Ting; Xie, Tianhong; Li, Hua; Song, Xia; Yue, Lei; Wang, Xi; Shen, Dong; Ma, Kaili; Jiang, Qinfang; Long, Runxiang; Yang, Rong; He, Xin; Zhang, Ye; Xie, Zhongping; Li, Qihan] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Med Biol, Kunming 650118, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Medical Biology - CAMS; Peking Union Medical College","Xie, ZP; Li, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Inst Med Biol, Kunming 650118, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","xzp218@hotmail.com; liqihan@imbcams.com.cn","Ma, Kaili/HLF-3589-2023","Ma, Kaili/0000-0002-5242-3000","CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences [2016-I2M-1-019]; Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects [2015BC008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3332019110]","CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences: [Grant Number 2016-I2M-1-019]; Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects: [Grant Number 2015BC008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Grant Number 3332019110].",,34,2,4,0,0,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,"2222-1751",,"EMERG MICROBES INFEC","Emerg.

Multiple-injection [F-18]nifene experiments with varying cold nifene masses were conducted on four rhesus monkeys with a microPET P4 scanner. Compartment modeling techniques were used to estimate regional B-max values and a global value of K-Dapp. The fast kinetic properties of [F-18]nifene also permitted alternative estimates of B-max and K-Dapp at transient equilibrium with the same experimental data using Scatchard-like methodologies. Averaged across subjects, the compartment modeling analysis yielded B-max values of 4.8 +/- 1.4, 4.3 +/- 1.0, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 1.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/mL in the regions of antereoventral thalamus, lateral geniculate, frontal cortex, and subiculum, respectively. The K-Dapp of nifene was 2.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/nnL. The Scatchard analysis based on graphical evaluation of the data after transient equilibrium yielded B-max estimations comparable to the modeling results with a positive bias of 28%. These findings show the utility of [F-18]nifene for measuring alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR B-max in vivo in the rhesus monkey with a single PET experiment.","[Hillmer, Ansel T.; Wooten, Dustin W.; Barnhart, Todd E.; Christian, Bradley T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Phys, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Hillmer, Ansel T.; Wooten, Dustin W.; Slesarev, Maxim S.; Ahlers, Elizabeth O.; Christian, Bradley T.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Lab Brain Imaging & Behav, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Schneider, Mary L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Kinesiol, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Mukherjee, Jogeshwar] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Radiol Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Mukherjee, Jogeshwar] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53705 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Hillmer, AT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Phys, 1111 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.","ahillmer@wisc.edu",", Ansel/AAV-6622-2020; Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/O-1320-2013",", Ansel/0000-0002-8105-1381; Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/0000-0003-1009-877X; Barnhart, Todd/0000-0002-9981-2150","NIH [AA017706, AA10079, AG029479, CA142188, P30-HD03352, T32-CA009206]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This work was supported by the following NIH Grants: AA017706, AA10079, AG029479, CA142188, P30-HD03352, and T32-CA009206.",,38,13,13,0,10,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","0271-678X","1559-7016",,"J CEREBR BLOOD F MET","J.

Tinnitus pathophysiology has been repeatedly shown to involve both auditory and non-auditory brain structures, making network-level studies of tinnitus critical. In this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, two resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches were used to better understand functional network disturbances in tinnitus. First, we demonstrated tinnitus-related reductions in RSFC between specific brain regions and resting-state networks (RSNs), defined by independent components analysis (ICA) and chosen for their overlap with structures known to be affected in tinnitus. Then, we restricted ICA to data from tinnitus patients, and identified one RSN not apparent in control data. This tinnitus RSN included auditory-sensory regions like inferior colliculus and medial Heschl's gyrus, as well as classically non-auditory regions like the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, lateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortex. Notably, patients' reported tinnitus loudness was positively correlated with RSFC between the mediodorsal nucleus and the tinnitus RSN, indicating that this network may underlie the auditory-sensory experience of tinnitus. These data support the idea that tinnitus involves network dysfunction, and further stress the importance of communication between auditory-sensory and fronto-striatal circuits in tinnitus pathophysiology.

The injected cortical regions were identified electrophysiologically. Retrograde labeling in Cl reveals two different projection patterns. The first pattern is characterized by a clear topographic organization and is composed of two parts. The somatosensory Cl shows a dorsoventral progression of cells projecting to the hindpaw, forepaw, and face representations of S1. The visual Cl has cells projecting to the vertical meridian representation of V1 surrounded dorsally by neurons projecting to the representation of retinal periphery. A second pattern of Cl projections is composed of neurons that are distributed diffusely through the nucleus. In both somatosensory and visual sectors, these intermingle with the topographically projecting cells, Neurons retrogradely labeled from cortical injections are always present in the AIN. In the central medial nucleus, the segregation of modality is evident: The visual-projecting sector is dorsal, and the somatosensory is ventral. Projections from the central lateral nucleus display detectable somatotopic and retinotopic organization: Individual regions are preferentially connected with specific representations of S1 or V1. In the paracentral nucleus, no clear regional preferences are detectable. Also performed were comparisons of the proportions of neurons projecting to different sensory representations. Projections to V1 from both AIN and Cl are biased towards the retinal periphery representation. S1 projection preference is for the forepaw representation in Cl and for the hindpaw in the AIN. The quantitative analysis of multiply labeled cells reveals that, compared to Cl, the AIN contains a higher proportion of neurons branching between different representations of S1 or V1. The concept of topographic vs. diffuse projecting systems is reviewed and discussed, and functional implications of quantitative analysis are considered.

The two D1R subtypes, D-1 and D-5, cannot be pharmacologically distinguished but have important functional differences. To understand their contributions to cortical function, we quantified their localization in the neuropil of primate PFC. We identified different patterns of distribution for the two receptors that showed variation across cortical laminae. Although D-1 was enriched in spines and D-5 in dendrites, there was considerable overlap in their distribution within neuronal compartments. To determine whether the D-1 and D-5 receptors are localized to separate populations of synapses, we employed double-labeling methods. We found the two receptors colocalized and quantified the overlap of their distribution in spines and axon terminals of prefrontal cortical area 9 in the Macaca mulatta monkey. The two receptors are found in partially overlapping populations, such that the D-5 receptor is found in a subpopulation of those spines and terminals that contain D-1. These results indicate that dopamine activation of the two D1R subtypes does not modulate disparate populations of synapses onto dendritic spines in prefrontal cortical area 9; rather, dopamine can activate D-1 and D-5 receptors on the same spines, plus an additional group of spines that contains only D-1. The implications of these results for the dose-dependent relationship between D1R activation and PFC function are discussed.","[Bordelon-Glausier, Jill R.; Muly, E.

Existence of this second pathway in primates, however, is not well established. A major question centers on whether the pulvinar acts as a relay, particularly in the path from the superior colliculus (SC) to the motion area in middle temporal cortex (MT). We used physiological microstimulation to identify pulvinar neurons belonging to the path from SC to MT in the macaque. We made three salient observations. First, we identified many neurons in the visual pulvinar that received input from SC or projected to MT, as well as a largely separate set of neurons that received input from MT. Second, and more importantly, we identified a subset of neurons as relay neurons that both received SC input and projected to MT. The identification of these relay neurons demonstrates a continuous functional path from SC to MT through the pulvinar in primates. Third, we histologically localized a subset of SC-MT relay neurons to the subdivision of inferior pulvinar known to project densely to MT but also localized SC-MT relay neurons to an adjacent subdivision. This pattern indicates that the pulvinar pathway is not limited to a single anatomically defined region.

In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), cells show distinct properties such as selectivity for particular wavelengths, increments or decrements in contrast, or preference for fine detail versus rapid motion. No studies, however, have measured how LGN cells respond when an animal is challenged to make a perceptual decision using information within the receptive fields of those LGN cells. In this study we measured neural activity in the macaque LGN during a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) contrast detection task or during a passive fixation task and found that a small proportion (13.5%) of single LGN parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) neurons matched the psychophysical performance of the monkey. The majority of LGN neurons measured in both tasks were not as sensitive as the monkey. The covariation between neural response and behavior (quantified as choice probability) was significantly above chance during active detection, even when there was no external stimulus. Interneuronal correlations and task-related gain modulations were negligible under the same condition. A bottom- up pooling model that used sensory neural responses to compute perceptual choices in the absence of interneuronal correlations could fully explain these results at the level of the LGN, supporting the hypothesis that the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple sensory neurons and that response fluctuations in these neurons can influence perception.","[Jiang, Yaoguang; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Yampolsky, Dmitry; Purushothaman, Gopathy; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University","Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, PMB 407935,465 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.","vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu",,,"NIH Core Grant [EY008126, HD15052]; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [EY001778, R21 EY019132]","NIH Core Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants EY001778 and R21 EY019132 (to V.

Participants included 45 BD and 31 MDD patients, and 72 HC. Regional MR brain volumes were used to calculate patterns of volumetric covariance. The identified latent volumetric systems were related to the depression severity and the duration of illness. BD differed from HC on the estimated parameters describing the paths of cortico-striatal, thalamo-striatal and intrastriatal loops of the CSTC circuit, and the paths between anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and hippocampus to amygdala of the LCSTC circuit. MDD differed from HC on the paths between putamen and thalamus, and PCC to hippocampus.

We used an amphetamine challenge combined with pharmacologic magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to map DA-associated circuitry in nonhuman primates with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Seven control cynomolgous monkeys and 10 MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated parkinsonian primates were studied longitudinally using both positron emission tomography ( PET) and phMRI. Amphetamine challenge (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in control monkeys increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in a number of brain regions not described previously, such as parafascicular thalamus, precentral gyrus, and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. With the high spatial resolution, we were also able to readily identify changes in rCBV in the anterior cingulate, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, caudate (tail and head), putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Amphetamine induced decreases in rCBV in occipital and posterior parietal cortices. Parkinsonian primates had a prominent loss of response to amphetamine, with relative sparing of the nucleus accumbens and parafascicular thalamus. There was a significant correlation between rCBV loss in the substantia nigra and both PET imaging of dopamine transporters and behavioral measures. Monkeys with partial lesions as defined by 2alpha-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane binding to dopamine transporters showed recruitment of premotor and motor cortex after amphetamine stimulus similar to what has been noted in Parkinson's patients during motor tasks. These data indicate that phMRI is a powerful tool for assessment of dynamic changes associated with normal and dysfunctional DA brain circuitry in primates.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Positron Emiss Tomog Ctr, Boston, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Nucl Magnet Resonance Ctr, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02129 USA; McLean Hosp, Neuroregenerat Lab, Belmont, MA 02478 USA","Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; McLean Hospital","Jenkins, BG (corresponding author), MGH, Nucl Magnet Resonance Ctr, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Bldg 149,13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.","bgj@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu","Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/AAZ-9566-2021; Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/ABD-8661-2021","Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/0000-0003-1144-9025; Isacson, Ole/0000-0001-8091-8302","NCRR NIH HHS [P51RR00168, P51 RR000168] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHS [R01 DA016187, DA-09467, P01 DA009467, DA-16187A] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-39793, P50 NS039793-05, P50 NS039793] Funding Source: Medline","NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,47,72,76,1,3,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","1529-2401",,"J NEUROSCI","J.

An adult female Macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) weighing 7.2 kg was used in constructing this atlas. CT, PET, and MRI were performed on the monkey before the specimen's head was frozen and cryoplaned. Closely spaced (50 mu m) images of the specimen blockface were then digitally acquired and modified to produce whole head and brain-only 3D image sets. The resulting data sets were organized into a digital volume and repositioned into a stereotaxic coordinate system defined by Horsley and Clark in 1908 [7]. Orthogonal images were obtained by digitally resampling the volume in order to produce a full set of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal images. Stereotaxic reference grids were applied to each image indicating the A/P, M/L, or H-c position within the digital volume. Specific anatomic structures were outlined from the cryosection data set and 3D surface models reconstructed. Structural labels indicating nuclei, tracts, and other neuroanatomical features were incorporated into coronally sliced cryosection images spaced at 500 mu m. The CT, PET, and MRI data sets were reconstructed into a digital volume and coregistered to the cryosection volume. All images constructed from this 3D map are available for public access via the Internet using an anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP) and the World Wide Web (http://www.loni.ucla.edu). The foremost advantage of this digital map is an integrated multimodality three-dimensional representation of the Macaca nemestrina brain, which is not possible with traditional atlases.

They all had typical signs of vestibular dysfunction such as transient rotatory vertigo with vomiting at the onset, ipsiversive body and ocular lateropulsion, and a complete ocular tilt reaction with tilts of the subjective visual vertical. Compared with healthy volunteers, who show activation in a network of temporoparietal vestibular areas within both hemispheres, especially in the posterior insula and retroinsular region that contains the human homologue of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) in monkeys, the activation pattern of the patients with Wallenberg's syndrome was typically changed. During caloric irrigation of the ear ipsilateral to the side of the lesion, they showed no or significantly reduced activation in the contralateral hemisphere, whereas the activation pattern in the ipsilateral hemisphere appeared normal. These results are compatible with bilateral ascending vestibular pathways from the vestibular nuclei to the vestibular cortex. The novel finding in all three patients was that the activation patterns were compatible with the assumption that only the crossing fibers from the medial vestibular subnucleus to the contralateral medial longitudinal fascicle were affected, but the ipsilateral vestibular thalamocortical projections via the superior vestibular subnucleus were spared. Thus, the activation pattern in the PET study may reflect the vestibular tonic imbalance within the vestibular nuclei circuitry at the cortical level.","Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Nucl Med, D-8000 Munich, Germany; Univ Mainz, Dept Nucl Med, D-6500 Mainz, Germany","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Munich; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Dieterich, M (corresponding author), Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.","dieterich@neurologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de",,"schwaiger, markus/0000-0002-2305-7144",,,,,31,28,30,0,4,"NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES","NEW YORK","2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA","0077-8923",,"1-57331-565-6","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2005,1039,,,,,,368,383,,"10.1196/annals.1325.035","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1325.035"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1325.035"")",,,16,"Multidisciplinary Sciences; Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","BCQ54",15826990,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000230780400035","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000230780400035"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recent studies indicate that M13 bacteriophage, a very large nanoparticle, binds to beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein proteins, leading to plaque disaggregation in models of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. To determine the feasibility, safety, and characteristics of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of M13 bacteriophage to the brain, the authors perfused primate brains with bacteriophage. Methods. Four nonhuman primates underwent CED of M13 bacteriophage (900 nm) to thalamic gray matter (4 infusions) and frontal white matter (3 infusions). Bacteriophage was coinfused with Gd-DTPA (1 mM), and serial MRI studies were performed during infusion. Animals were monitored for neurological deficits and were killed 3 days after infusion. Tissues were analyzed for bacteriophage distribution. Results. Real-time T1-weighted MRI studies of coinfused Gd-DTPA during infusion demonstrated a discrete region of perfusion in both thalamic gray and frontal white matter. An MRI-volumetric analysis revealed that the mean volume of distribution (Vd) to volume of infusion (Vi) ratio of M13 bacteriophage was 2.3 +/- 0.2 in gray matter and 1.9 +/- 0.3 in white matter. The mean values are expressed +/- SD. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated mean Vd:Vi ratios of 2.9 +/- 0.2 in gray matter and 2.1 +/- 0.3 in white matter. The Gd-DTPA accurately tracked M13 bacteriophage distribution (the mean difference between imaging and actual bacteriophage Vd was insignificant [p > 0.05], and was -2.2% +/- 9.9% in thalamic gray matter and 9.1% +/- 9.5% in frontal white matter). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed evidence of additional spread from the initial delivery site in white matter (mean Vd:Vi, 16.1 +/- 9.1). All animals remained neurologically intact after infusion during the observation period, and histological studies revealed no evidence of toxicity. Conclusions. The CED method can be used successfully and safely to distribute M13 bacteriophage in the brain. Furthermore, additional white matter spread after infusion cessation enhances distribution of this large nanoparticle. Real-time MRI studies of coinfused Gd-DTPA (1 mM) can be used for accurate tracking of distribution during infusion of M13 bacteriophage.

To examine the cellular bases for these differences, we exposed rhesus macaque fetuses to x-rays during early gestation (embryonic day [E]30E42), i.e., before the onset of corticogenesis, or in midgestation (E70E81), when superficial cortical layers are generated. Animals were delivered at term (approximate to E165), and the size and cellular composition of prefrontal association cortex (area 46) examined in adults using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and stereologic analysis. Both early and midgestational radiation exposure diminished the surface area and volume of area 46. However, early exposure spared cortical thickness and did not alter laminar composition, and due to higher cell density, neuron number was within the normal range. In contrast, exposure to x-rays at midgestation reduced cortical thickness, mainly due to elimination of neurons destined for the superficial layers. A cell-sparse gap, observed within layer III, was not filled by the later-generated neurons destined for layer II, indicating that there is no subsequent replacement of the lost neurons. The distinct areal and laminar pathology consequent to temporally segregated irradiation is consistent with basic postulates of the radial unit hypothesis of cortical development. In addition, we show that an environmental disturbance inflicted in early gestation can induce subtle cytoarchitectonic alterations without loss of neurons, such as those observed in schizophrenia, whereas midgestational exposure causes selective elimination of neurons and cortical thinning as observed in some forms of mental retardation and fetal alcohol syndrome.

Pyramidal neurons in PFC deep layer 3 play a central role in both thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry. Given that somal size tends to be associated with both the dendritic and axonal architecture of a neuron, abnormalities in these circuits in schizophrenia may be associated with a change in the somal size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Methods: We used design-based stereology to estimate the somal volume of pyramidal neurons in deep layer 3 of PFC area 9 in 28 subjects with schizophrenia, each of whom was matched to 1 normal comparison subject for sex, age, and postmortem interval. Results: The geometric mean of the somal volume estimates in the subjects with schizophrenia was significantly (P=.02) decreased by 9.2%. This decrease was associated with a shift in the distribution of somal volumes toward smaller sizes. Neither antipsychotic medication treatment history nor duration of illness was associated with somal size. Conclusions: These findings independently replicate previous reports of decreased somal size in the PFC in schizophrenia. The reduction in size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons is consistent with abnormalities in thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry, suggesting that disruption of these circuits may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Lewis, DA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, 3811 Ohara St,W1650 BST, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Lewis, David A/G-4053-2014","Lewis, David A/0000-0002-3225-6778","NIMH NIH HHS [MH00519, MH45156, MH18951, MH60473] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,58,188,188,0,1,"AMER MEDICAL ASSOC","CHICAGO","515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA","0003-990X",,,"ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT","Arch.

The rare surviving geniculate projection neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from extra-striate cortex and retinogeniculate terminals were labelled by an intraocular injection of HRP. Retinal terminals in the degenerated dLGN made synaptic contact exclusively with the dendrites of interneurons immunopositive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in both parvocellular and magnocellular regions of dLGN. As well as being postsynaptic to retinal terminals these vesicle-containing dendrites were pre- and postsynaptic to other similar dendrites, and presynaptic to relay cells. Surviving labelled projection neurons received retinal input indirectly, via both the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and GABA-immunonegative terminals characteristic of those from the superior colliculus. In the degenerated, as opposed to the normal dLGN, about 20% of retinal terminals were GABA-immunopositive and GABA-immunoreactivity was prominently elevated in the ganglion and amacrine cell layers of the degenerated half of the retina. The optic nerve also contained numerous GABA-immunopositive axons but very few such axons were found in a normal optic nerve processed in identical manner. The surviving pathways from the retina must underlie the visual abilities that survive striate cortical removal in monkeys and human patients and may involve the degenerated dLGN as well as the mid-brain.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, S PARKS RD, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND; UNIV MUNICH, INST MED PSYCHOL, W-8000 MUNICH 2, GERMANY; MRC, ANAT NEUROPHARMACOL UNIT, OXFORD OX1 3QT, ENGLAND; HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI, UNITED RES ORG, H-1094 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY; SEMMELWEIS UNIV, SCH MED, H-1094 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","University of Oxford; University of Munich; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Semmelweis University",,,,,,,,,80,46,46,0,4,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

This introduces the possibility of a re-entrant motion signal affecting the relay of the retinal input through the LGN to the visual cortex. The question is whether the response of LGN cells to moving stimuli involves a component derived from this feedback. By producing a reversible focal pharmacological block of the activity of an MT direction column we show the presence of such an influence from MT on the responses of magno, parvo and koniocellular cells in the macaque LGN. The pattern of effect in the LGN reflects the direction bias of the MT location inactivated. This suggests a moving stimulus is captured by iterative interactions in the circuit formed by visual cortical areas and visual thalamus. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Tracers were visualized using standard immunohistochemistry or evaluated in vivo using manganese (Mn2+) as an MRI paramagnetic tracer. The in vivo tract tracing turned out to be very sensitive with a high correspondence to the histological labelling. Tracers injected into the mediodorsal thalamus labelled the medial and rostral pole of the frontal lobe as well as the anterior cingulate, anterior insular and dorsomedial frontal cortices. Subsequently, the reciprocity and specificity of these connections were tested from injections into the traced frontal cortices indicating that the PFC has cortical connections to different parts of the MD nucleus. Although the granular layer IV, characteristic of primate PFC could not be identified, both cytoarchitectonic and connectional data suggests that the Gottingen minipig has a structurally divided prefrontal cortex.

Anderson et al. (2006) used anterograde tracers to label the projection from the dorsal CN (DCN) to the MG in guinea pigs. We examined this pathway with retrograde tracers. The results confirm a pathway from the DCN, originating primarily from the deep layers. Labeled cells included a few giant cells and a larger number of small cells of unknown type. Many more labeled cells were present in the ventral CN (VCN). These cells, identifiable as multipolar (stellate) or small cells, were found throughout much of the VCN. Most of the labeled cells were located contralateral to the injection site. The CN to MG pathway bypasses the inferior colliculus (IC), where most ascending auditory information is processed. Anderson et al. (2006) hypothesized that CN-MG axons are collaterals of axons that reach the IC. We tested this hypothesis by injecting different fluorescent tracers into the MG and IC and examining the CN for double-labeled cells. After injections on the same side of the brain, double-labeled cells were found in the contralateral VCN and DCN. Most double-labeled cells were in the VCN, where they accounted for up to 37% of the cells labeled by the MG injection. We conclude that projections from the CN to the MG originate from the VCN and, less so, from the DCN. A significant proportion of the cells send a collateral projection to the IC. Presumably, the collateral projections send the same information to both the MG and the IC. The results suggest that T-stellate cells of the VCN are a major source of direct projections to the auditory thalamus.","[Schofield, Brett R.; Mellott, Jeffrey G.; Foster, Nichole L.] NE Ohio Med Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA; [Schofield, Brett R.; Foster, Nichole L.] Kent State Univ, Sch Biomed Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Motts, Susan D.] Arkansas State Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Jonesboro, AR USA","Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED); University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Arkansas State University","Schofield, BR (corresponding author), NE Ohio Med Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 4209 State Route 44,POB 95, Rootstown, OH 44272 USA.","bschofie@neomed.edu",,"Schofield, Brett/0000-0002-0875-7759; Beebe, Nichole/0000-0003-3692-7986; Mellott, Jeffrey/0000-0003-4753-7326","National Institutes of Health [R01 DC04391, F32 DC012450]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","Special thanks to Colleen Sowick and Megan Storey-Workley for expert technical assistance.

There is growing evidence that such knowledge may be acquired through a number of different means, each perhaps with its own neuronal substrate. One major distinction is between serial order information acquired intentionally and leading to explicit conscious knowledge of the sequence structure, and information acquired incidentally through experience. While this latter form of knowledge influences behaviour, it may do so without the participant being aware of the sequential information, i.e. it is acquired implicitly. Evidence from physiological and lesion studies in animals and imaging studies in humans suggests that these two forms of learning may have dissociable neuronal substrates. Specifically, the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit centred on the caudate nucleus is proposed to be involved in intentional sequence learning and that based on the putamen on incidental learning. The present study tested one part of this proposed dissociation by assessing patients with Huntington's disease on tasks of the two forms of learning. On the test of trial-and-error intentional learning there were marked deficits, which were closely related to disease progression and to measures of executive cognitive dysfunction. This finding was in contrast to the finding from the incidental learning task. Performance of the Huntington's disease group was essentially normal and unrelated to measures of disease progression and cognitive status. The results, although supportive of the proposed dual-system hypothesis, offer only partial confirmation. Further direct study is required using similar tasks in patients with putamenal disorder or lesions within the skeletomotor striato-thalamo-cortical circuit.","Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol, London SE5 8AF, England; UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Hosp Virgen Macarena, Dept Neurol, Seville, Spain; Hosp Virgen Macarena, Dept Mol Genet, Seville, Spain","University of London; King's College London; University of London; University College London; Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena; Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena","Brown, RG (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.","r.brown@iop.kcl.ac.uk","Channon, Shelley/C-1754-2008; Brown, Richard G/A-9599-2010","Brown, Richard G/0000-0001-9021-0172",,,,,78,37,38,0,12,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","NOV",2001,124,,11,,,,2188,2202,,"10.1093/brain/124.11.2188","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/124.11.2188"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/124.11.2188"")",,,15,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","494QC",11673321,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000172295500007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000172295500007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recently, we showed that such stimulation of a part of the PPC in the caudal lateral sulcus (LS) elicits eye movements in these monkeys. Here, we studied the functional and anatomical connections of this oculomotor region we call parietal eye field (PEF) with frontal eye field (FEF) and other cortical regions in 2 squirrel monkeys. We demonstrated these connections with intrinsic optical imaging and injections of anatomical tracers. Optical imaging of frontal cortex during stimulation of the PEF evoked focal functional activation within FEF. Tracing studies confirmed the functional PEF-FEF connections. Moreover, tracer injections revealed PEF connections with other PPC regions on the dorsolateral and medial brain surface, cortex in the caudal LS, and visual and auditory cortical association areas. Subcortical projections of PEF were primarily with superior colliculus, and pontine nuclei as well as nuclei of the dorsal posterior thalamus and caudate.

In the primates, two of the three major subdivisions, the lateral and inferior pulvinar, are heavily interconnected with a significant proportion of the visual association cortex. However, while we now have a better understanding of the bidirectional connectivity of these pulvinar subdivisions, its functions remain somewhat of an enigma. Over the past few years, researchers have started to tackle this problem by addressing it from the angle of development and visual cortical lesions. In this review, we will draw together literature from the realms of studies in nonhuman primates and humans that have informed much of the current understanding. This literature has been responsible for changing many long-held opinions on the development of the visual cortex and how the pulvinar interacts dynamically with cortices during early life to ensure rapid development and functional capacity Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest involvement of the pulvinar following lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1) and geniculostriate pathway in early life which have far better functional outcomes than identical lesions obtained in adulthood. Shedding new light on the pulvinar and its role following lesions of the visual brain has implications for our understanding of visual brain disorders and the potential for recovery.","[Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Morrone, Maria Concetta] Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy; [Morrone, Maria Concetta] IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy","Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute; Monash University; University of Pisa; IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris","Morrone, MC (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy.;Morrone, MC (corresponding author), IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy.","concetta@in.cnr.it","Bourne, James/B-5265-2018; Morrone, Maria Concetta/C-6756-2014","Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108; Morrone, Maria Concetta/0000-0002-1025-0316","ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN [338866]; NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship [APP1077677]","ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN; NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","This work was supported by ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN (grant no. 338866) to MM.

Most studies have evaluated effects of the OP nerve agent soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Soman-induced acute and chronic morphological changes have been examined. The effects of nerve agent therapy (i.e. pyridostigmine, praloxidime chloride and atropine), with and without an anticonvulsant (i.e. diazepam, midazolam), on soman-induced lesions have also been studied. Acute changes in the central nervous system of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to soman alone or soman and therapy, without an anticonvulsant, were characterized by neuronal degeneration and necrosis and neuropil edema. The lesions were usually present in the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdaloid complex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and hippocampus. Morphologically, these lesions resemble lesions produced by hypoxic-ischemic injury or by seizures and are similar to soman-induced changes in other laboratory animals. Nerve agent therapy supplemented with an anticonvulsant reduced or prevented soman-induced acute neural lesions. Acute changes in non-neural tissues were limited to the heart (e.g. hemorrhage, myofiber necrosis, myocarditis) and skeletal muscle (e.g. myofiber necrosis). Heart lesions in the non-human primate are similar to OP-induced heart lesions in man. The pathogenesis of the acute lesions in both the central nervous system and heart is discussed.

However, growing recognition of the dopamine (DA) loss and other pathology in extra-striatal brain regions has led to uncertainty whether loss of DA in the striatum is sufficient to cause parkinsonian signs. We tested this hypothesis by infusing cis-flupenthixol (cis-flu: a broad-spectrum D1/D2 receptor antagonist) into different regions of the macaque putamen (3 hemispheres of 2 monkeys) while the animal performed a visually-cued choice reaction time task in which visual cues indicated the arm to reach with and the peripheral target to contact to obtain food reward. Following reward delivery, the animal was required to self-initiate release of the peripheral target and return of the chosen hand to its home position (i.e., without the benefit of external sensory cues or immediate rewards). Infusions of cis-flu at 15 of 26 sites induced prolongations of reaction time (9 of 15 cases), movement duration (6 cases), and/or dwell time of the hand at the peripheral target (8 cases). Dwell times were affected more severely (+ 95%) than visually-triggered reaction times or movement durations (+25% and +15%, respectively). Specifically, the animal's hand often 'froze' at the peripheral target for up to 25-s, similar to the akinetic freezing episodes observed in PD patients. Across injections, slowing of self-initiation did not correlate in severity with prolongations of visually-triggered reaction time or movement duration, although the latter two were correlated with each other. Episodes of slowed self-initiation appeared primarily in the arm contralateral to the injected hemisphere and were not associated with increased muscle co-contraction or global alterations in behavioral state (i.e., inattention or reduced motivation), consistent with the idea that these episodes reflected a fundamental impairment of movement initiation. We found no evidence for an anatomic topography within the putamen for the effects elicited. We conclude that acute focal blockade of DA transmission in the putamen is sufficient to induce marked akinesia-like impairments. Furthermore, different classes of impairments can be induced independently, suggesting that specific parkinsonian signs have unique pathophysiologic substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the structural organization of the IPCC is a controversial issue. For example, cytoarchitectonic parcellations reported in the literature range from 2 to 7 areas. Moreover, anatomical descriptions of the human IPCC are often based on experiments in the macaque monkey. In this study, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging combined with probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity of the human IPCC, and used this information to parcellate this cortex area. This provides a new structural map of the human IPCC, comprising 3 subareas (inferior parietal cortex anterior, IPC middle, and IPC posterior) of comparable size, in a rostro-caudal arrangement in the left and right hemispheres. Each subarea is characterized by a connectivity fingerprint, and the parcellation is similar to the subdivision reported for the macaque IPCC with 3 areas in a rostro-caudal arrangement (PF, PFG, and PG). However, the present study also reliably demonstrates new structural features in the connectivity pattern of the human IPCC, which are not known to exist in the macaque. This study quantifies intersubject variability by providing a population representation of the subarea arrangement and demonstrates the substantial lateralization of the connectivity patterns of the IPCC.","[Ruschel, Michael; Knoesche, Thomas R.; Anwander, Alfred] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Res Grp Cort Networks & Cognit Funct, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Friederici, Angela D.; Anwander, Alfred] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neuropsychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Turner, Robert; Geyer, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurophys, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society","Anwander, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","anwander@cbs.mpg.de","Anwander, Alfred/B-5874-2011","Anwander, Alfred/0000-0002-4861-4808; Turner, Robert/0000-0001-5055-9644","University Leipzig MD grant; Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open [238292]","University Leipzig MD grant; Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open","This work was supported by a University Leipzig MD grant to M.R. and the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open (grant no. 238292): http://www.brain-connect.eu.",,59,59,59,0,15,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA had-similar to acetylcholinesterase enzymatic activity-a widespread distribution in human brain. Acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA positive cells corresponded to perikarya rich in acetylcholinesterase activity in most but not all regions. Examples for mismatches included the inferior olive and human cerebellar cortex. The presence of hybridization signals in cerebral cortex and an enrichment in layer III and V of most isocortical areas confirmed that perikaryal acetylcholinesterase in cerebral cortex is of postsynaptic origin and not derived from cholinergic projections. In striatum the expression of high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA was restricted to a small population of large striatal neurons. In addition, low levels of expression were found in most medium sized striatal neurons. Cholinergic neurons tended to express high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA whereas in cholinoceptive neurons the levels were moderate to low. However, some noncholinergic neurons like dopaminergic cells in substantia nigra, noradrenergic cells in locus coeruleus, serotoninergic cells in raphe dorsalis, GABAergic cells in thalamic reticular nucleus, granular cells in cerebellar cortex and pontine relay neurons expressed levels comparable to cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain. It is suggested that neurons expressing high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA may synthesize acetylcholinesterase for axonal transport whereas neurons with an expression of acetylcholinesterase confined to somatodendritic regions tend to contain lower levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA.","CSIC, CID, DEPT NEUROQUIM, E-08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Investigacion y Desarrollo Pascual Vila (CID-CSIC)","LANDWEHRMEYER, B (corresponding author), UNIV BASEL, DEPT PATHOL, DIV NEUROPATHOL, SCHONBEINSTR 40, CH-4003 BASEL, SWITZERLAND.",,"Landwehrmeyer, Georg Bernhard/AHB-4443-2022","Landwehrmeyer, Georg Bernhard/0000-0003-3375-790X",,,,,87,29,30,0,2,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4522","1873-7544",,"NEUROSCIENCE","Neuroscience","DEC",1993,57,3,,,,,615,634,,"10.1016/0306-4522(93)90010-D","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90010-D"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90010-D"")",,,20,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","MK250",8309527,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993MK25000010","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993MK25000010"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and its consequences on brain functions, is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive) and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds, and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls. We found AT8-positive staining and 4R-tau inclusions only in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques. Characteristic pathological hallmarks of progressive supranuclear palsy, including globose and neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes and coiled bodies, were found close to the injection sites but also in connected brain regions that are known to be affected in progressive supranuclear palsy (striatum, pallidum, thalamus). Interestingly, while glial AT8-positive lesions were the most frequent near the injection site, we found mainly neuronal inclusions in the remote brain area, consistent with a neuronal transsynaptic spreading of the disease. Our results demonstrate that progressive supranuclear palsy patient-derived tau aggregates can induce motor and behavioural impairments in non-human primates related to the prion-like seeding and spreading of typical pathological progressive supranuclear palsy lesions. This pilot study paves the way for supporting progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaque as a relevant animal model to accelerate drug development targeting this rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. We undertook a study of skin cancer (SC) recognition and health promotion among interns in an Irish hospital. While the knowledge on SC was good, the majority of the interns did not practice safe sun behaviours themselves, and the majority did not feel confident in diagnosing skin lesions or SC. Most had never performed a skin examination on patients, or discussed sun protection or skin self examination with their patients.","[Darricau, Morgane; Crochemore, Louis; Dehay, Benjamin; Bezard, Erwan; Planche, Vincent] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, UMR 5293, CNRS, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Katsinelos, Taxiarchis; McEwan, William A.] Univ Cambridge, UK Dementia Res Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Cambridge CB2 0AH, England; [Raschella, Flavio; Milekovic, Tomislav; Courtine, Gregoire] Swiss Fed Inst Technol EPFL, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Raschella, Flavio; Milekovic, Tomislav; Courtine, Gregoire] Defitech Ctr Intervent Neurotherapies NeuroRestor, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Raschella, Flavio; Milekovic, Tomislav; Courtine, Gregoire] Ctr Hosp Univ Vaudois CHUV, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Li, Qin; Bezard, Erwan] Motac Neurosci, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Planche, Vincent] CHU Bordeaux, Ctr Memoire Ressources & Rech, Pole Neurosci Clin, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Planche, Vincent] Ctr Broca Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR CNRS 5293, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; University of Cambridge; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); CHU Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux","Planche, V (corresponding author), Ctr Broca Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR CNRS 5293, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France.","vincent.planche@u-bordeaux.fr","Katsinelos, Taxiarchis/IQU-9608-2023; Bezard, Erwan/A-8173-2008; DEHAY, Benjamin/I-4713-2016; Milekovic, Tomislav/R-7972-2017","Katsinelos, Taxiarchis/0000-0001-6951-3216; Bezard, Erwan/0000-0002-0410-4638; DEHAY, Benjamin/0000-0003-1723-9045; Planche, Vincent/0000-0003-3713-227X; DARRICAU, Morgane/0000-0002-6663-3156; Milekovic, Tomislav/0000-0001-6769-6506","PSP-France Foundation; Encephalia; Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation; French governmen [GPR BRAIN_2030]; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche; Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking [116060]; European Union; EFPIA; Wellcome Trust; Royal Society [206248/Z/17/Z]; UK Dementia Research Institute from DRI Ltd - UK Medical Research Council; Alzheimer's Society; Alzheimer's Research UK; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) [17.00038]; Defitech Center for Interventional Neurotherapies-NeuroRestore","PSP-France Foundation; Encephalia; Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation; French governmen; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche(Estonian Research Council); Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking; European Union(European Union (EU)); EFPIA; Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Royal Society(Royal Society); UK Dementia Research Institute from DRI Ltd - UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Alzheimer's Society; Alzheimer's Research UK(Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK)); Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI); Defitech Center for Interventional Neurotherapies-NeuroRestore","This work was supported by grants from PSP-France Foundation, Encephalia and the Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation (CCArecherche Inserm-Bettencourt).

This state-dependence is believed to arise, at least in part, in response to inputs from subcortical structures that release neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, often nonsynaptically. The mechanisms that underlie the interaction between these nonsynaptic signals and the more point-to-point synaptic cortical circuitry are not well understood. This review highlights the state of the field, with a focus on cholinergic action in early visual processing. Key anatomical and physiological features of both the cholinergic and the visual systems are discussed. Furthermore, presenting evidence of cholinergic modulation in visual thalamus and primary visual cortex, we explore potential functional roles of acetylcholine and its effects on the processing of visual input over the sleep-wake cycle, sensory gain control during wakefulness, and consider evidence for cholinergic support of visual attention.","[Krueger, Juliane; Disney, Anita A.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 311 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Duke University","Krueger, J (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 311 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.","juliane.krueger@duke.edu",,"Disney, Anita/0000-0003-3390-0681; Krueger, Juliane/0000-0001-9074-7025","National Institutes of Health [R01 EY025422, R00 MH093567]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Numbers: R01 EY025422, R00 MH093567",,161,17,17,0,6,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

This would be reflected in significant structural differences between poor-outcome (i.e., Kraepelinian) and non-Kraepelinian patients. To assess this possibility, we have evaluated the degree of deviation in brain structure in Kraepelinian patients with respect to controls and non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients. We used voxel-brain morphometry (VBM) to assess the differences in gray matter volume across the brain in the Kraepelinian group with respect to the healthy controls and non-Kraepelinian patients. Twenty-six Kraepelinian and 18 non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients and 41 healthy controls were included. With respect to the healthy controls, the Kraepelinian patients showed a very significant decrease in gray matter in the frontal, occipital, and limbic cortices, and, at a subcortical level, bilaterally in the striatum and thalamus. In comparison with the non-Kraepelinian patients, the Kraepelinian individuals continued to show a similar subcortical decrease. Thus, Kraepelinian patients may be characterized by a distinct pattern of brain abnormalities, in particular, in subcortical regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several cortical areas known to be involved in this process exchange projections with the dorsal aspect of the thalamic pulvinar nucleus, suggesting that this structure may play a central role in visuomotor behavior. Here, we used reversible inactivation to investigate the role of the dorsal pulvinar in the selection and execution of visually guided manual and saccadic eye movements in macaque monkeys. We found that unilateral pulvinar inactivation resulted in a spatial neglect syndrome accompanied by visuomotor deficits including optic ataxia during visually guided limb movements. Monkeys were severely disrupted in their visually guided behavior regarding space contralateral to the side of the injection in several domains, including the following: (1) target selection in both manual and oculomotor tasks, (2) limb usage in a manual retrieval task, and (3) spontaneous visual exploration. In addition, saccades into the ipsilesional field had abnormally short latencies and tended to overshoot their mark. None of the deficits could be explained by a visual field defect or primary motor deficit. These findings highlight the importance of the dorsal aspect of the pulvinar nucleus as a critical hub for spatial attention and selection of visually guided actions.","[Wilke, Melanie; Smith, Katy; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Turchi, Janita; Mishkin, Mortimer] NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurosci, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, Natl Inst Neurol Disorders & Stroke,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)","Wilke, M (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Biol, MC 216-76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","melanie.wilke@vis.caltech.edu",,"Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360","National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Eye Institute Intramural Research Programs","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Eye Institute Intramural Research Programs(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Eye Institute Intramural Research Programs.

While MMN has been extensively used in human electrophysiological studies of auditory processing, the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying its generation remain unclear. We investigate possible homologs of the MMN in macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) using a frequency oddball paradigm in which rare deviant tones are randomly interspersed among frequent standard tones. Standards and deviants had frequencies equal to the best frequency (BF) of the recorded neural population or to a frequency that evoked a response half the amplitude of the BF response. Early and later field potentials, current source density components, multiunit activity, and induced high-gamma band responses were larger when elicited by deviants than by standards of the same frequency. Laminar analysis indicated that differences between deviant and standard responses were more prominent in later activity, thus suggesting cortical amplification of initial responses driven by thalamocortical inputs. However, unlike the human MMN, larger deviant responses were characterized by the enhancement of obligatory responses rather than the introduction of new components. Furthermore, a control condition wherein deviants were interspersed among many tones of variable frequency replicated the larger responses to deviants under the oddball condition. Results suggest that differential responses under the oddball condition in macaque A1 reflect stimulus-specific adaptation rather than deviance detection per se. We conclude that neural mechanisms of deviance detection likely reside in cortical areas outside of A1.","[Fishman, Yonatan I.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Kennedy Ctr, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Steinschneider, Mitchell] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Bronx, NY 10461 USA","Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine","Fishman, YI (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Kennedy Ctr, Dept Neurol, Room 322,1410 Pelham Pkwy, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.","yonatan.fishman@einstein.yu.edu",,"Steinschneider, Mitchell/0000-0002-8932-3943","NIH [DC00657]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This work was supported by NIH Grant DC00657.

However, recent evidence in non-human primates, along with some evidence in humans with damaged primary visual cortex (e.g., blindsight for motion in the blind visual hemifield), have argued for the existence of a direct thalamic-to-extrastriate projection for motion processing. This evidence remains controversial. Here we tested the idea that direct thalamic input to extrastriate motion processing areas exists in humans but might be masked in scalp recordings by activity from early visual areas. To do this, we employed stimuli that induced strong refractory effects in primary visual cortex-thereby creating a brief reversable lesion in primary visual cortex-immediately before the presentation of a motion stimulus. Under these conditions, we then assessed whether motion areas of cortex were still able to process the motion stimuli by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related magnetic fields (ERFs/MEG). We found robust motion-related activity in extrastriate motion processing areas in the ERP and MEG signals even when primary visual cortex was heavily suppressed by our manipulation. This finding provides evidence for a direct thalamic functional pathway to extrastriate visual cortical motion processing areas in the human that bypasses primary visual cortex.

The following study utilized a double labeling paradigm, using antibodies that recognize non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and other neuronal markers, to further define, quantitatively, the subclasses of neurons that contain immunoreactivity for the AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor subunits in the monkey prefrontal cortex. Double labeling with an antibody that recognizes common epitopes in AMPA/kainate subunits GluR2 and GluR3 (GluR2/3) in combination with an antibody that recognizes the kainate receptor subunits GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 (GluR5/6/7) demonstrated that immunoreactivity for these two receptor classes was highly colocalized in a great majority of the pyramidal neurons in this region but present in only a minority of neurochemically identified subclasses of GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, GluR2/3 immunoreactivity had principally a somatic distribution whereas GluR5/6/7 labeling was predominately found in the perikarya and/or particular dendritic domains. In contrast, intense GluR1 labeling was observed in a small subpopulation of interneurons and low GluR1 immunoreactivity was present in many other cortical neurons. These results demonstrate that there is a high degree of specificity in the distribution of AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor-class proteins to subclasses of neurons within the neocortex. A neuron's combination of excitatory amino acid receptor subunits may regulate its response to excitatory inputs and further defines the role of identified subclasses of neurons in the complex circuitry of the cerebral cortex and may also indicate the basis for the apparent cellular selectivity of excitotoxic degenerative processes.","CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL, BOX 1065, 1 GUSTAVE L LEVY PL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, HYBRIDOMA FACL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; SALK INST BIOL STUDIES, MOLEC NEUROBIOL LAB, LA JOLLA, CA 92037 USA; UNIV COLORADO, HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT PHARMACOL, DENVER, CO 80262 USA","City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Salk Institute; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver",,,"Morrison, John H/F-9229-2012; Vickers, James C/J-7464-2014","Vickers, James C/0000-0001-5671-4879; Huntley, George W./0000-0003-3645-6192","NIA NIH HHS [AG06647] Funding Source: Medline","NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))",,,64,143,143,0,4,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

However, the mechanisms by which attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.","[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

There is no age-related change in the cross-sectional area of the fornix, but there is a significant loss of myelinated nerve fibers. The loss of myelinated nerve fibers is accompanied by a significant increase in the numbers of nerve fibers that show degeneration of their axons and alterations in myelin sheaths. Aging also brings about an increase in the frequency of profiles of paranodes, indicating that some of the nerve fibers are being remyelinated. Aging also affects neuroglial cells. Each type shows inclusions in their perikarya, and in the case of astrocytes and microglial cells some of these inclusions are phagocytosed myelin. Numbers of astrocytes and microglial cells do not appear to increase with age, but there is a 20% increase in oligodendrocytes. When correlations with cognitive impairments displayed by individual monkeys are examined, the decreased packing density of nerve fibers and the increasing frequency of nerve fibers with degenerating axons and of nerve fibers with altered myelin sheaths all correlate with increasing cognitive impairment. It is suggested that these correlations result from some disconnection of the hippocampus from the thalamus, septal nuclei, and medial frontal cortex and from reductions in the conduction velocity brought about by the shorter internodal lengths of remyelinated nerve fibers in the fornix.

We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (Macaca mulatta) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.","[Topalidou, Meropi; Rougier, Nicolas P.] INRIA Bordeaux Sud Ouest, F-33405 Talence, France; [Topalidou, Meropi; Kase, Daisuke; Boraud, Thomas; Rougier, Nicolas P.] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Topalidou, Meropi; Kase, Daisuke; Boraud, Thomas; Rougier, Nicolas P.] CNRS, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, UMR 5293, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Topalidou, Meropi; Rougier, Nicolas P.] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Bordelais Rech Informat, Inst Polytech Bordeaux, CNRS,UMR 5800, F-33405 Bordeaux, France; [Kase, Daisuke; Boraud, Thomas] CNRS, French Israeli Neurosci Lab, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Boraud, Thomas] Ctr Hosp Univ Bordeaux, Inst MN Clin, F-33000 Bordeaux, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CHU Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux","Rougier, NP (corresponding author), INRIA Bordeaux Sud Ouest, F-33405 Talence, France.;Rougier, NP (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.;Rougier, NP (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, UMR 5293, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.;Rougier, NP (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Lab Bordelais Rech Informat, Inst Polytech Bordeaux, CNRS,UMR 5800, F-33405 Bordeaux, France.","nicolas.rougier@inria.fr","Rougier, Nicolas P./B-2983-2010","Boraud, Thomas/0000-0002-8942-0129; Topalidou, Meropi/0000-0003-3695-4941; Rougier, Nicolas P./0000-0002-6972-589X; Kase, Daisuke/0000-0001-6787-5862","Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-09-SYSC-002-03]; Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Laboratory of Excellency BRAIN; INRIA [14333-2012]; Uehara Memorial Foundation; French government","Agence Nationale pour la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Laboratory of Excellency BRAIN; INRIA; Uehara Memorial Foundation(Uehara Memorial Foundation); French government","This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche Grant ANR-09-SYSC-002-03 and the Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).

Here, we have newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and medical research using marmosets. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (induding direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.","[Merchant, Hugo] UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Grahn, Jessica] Univ Western Ontario, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Grahn, Jessica] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Trainor, Laurel] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rohrmeier, Martin] MIT Intelligence Initiat, Dept Linguist & Philosophy, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fitch, W.

Cortical cells projecting to the caudal medulla were confined to the contralateral layer V with their descending axons crossing the midline at the level of pyramidal decussation. Cortical afferents to Sp5C originated from cells located mainly in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the insular cortex, whereas cortical projections to the Cu originated mainly from the primary motor cortex (M1), the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2). The SRD received dense cortical afferents from larger, widespread cortical areas: M1, M2, S1, S2, and the insular cortex. The existence of dense cortico-SRD connections supports the possibility of a pyramidal influence over SRD neurons, which might modify nociceptive information ascending to the cortex itself. This proposal is consistent with the fact that SRD efferents terminate densely in thalamic areas that influence sensorimotor cortical regions which in turn project to the SRD. Moreover, these corticofugal mechanisms could allow the cortex to select its own input by suppressing or augmenting transmission of signals through SRD-hindbrain/forebrain pathways or by coordinating activities in spino-SRD-spinal circuits and thus selecting the relevant information produced by the noxious stimulus.

Although brain regions involved in strategic memory retrieval in general have been identified, differences in retrieval operations related to distinct retrieval strategies are not well-understood. Thus, our aim was to identify brain regions whose activity is differentially involved in spatial-associative and temporal-associative retrieval. First, we showed that our behavioral paradigm probing memory for a set of object-location associations promoted the use of a spatial-associative structure following an encoding condition that provided Multiple associations to neighboring objects (spatial-associative condition) and the use of a temporal-associative structure following another study condition that provided predominantly temporal associations between sequentially presented items (temporal-associative condition). Next, we used an adapted version of this paradigm for functional MRI, where we contrasted brain activity related to the recall of object-location associations that were either encoded in the spatial- or the temporal-associative condition. In addition to brain regions generally involved in recall, we found that activity in higher-order visual regions, including the fusiform gyrus, the lingual gyrus, and the cuneus, was relatively enhanced when subjects used a spatial-associative structure for retrieval. In contrast, activity in the globus pallidus and the thalamus was relatively enhanced when subjects used a temporal-associative structure for retrieval. In conclusion, we provide evidence for differential involvement of these brain regions related to different types of strategic memory retrieval and the neural structures described play a role in either spatial-associative or temporal-associative memory retrieval.","[de Rover, Mischa; Petersson, Karl Magnus; Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, FC Donders Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Werf, Sieberen R.; Berger, Hans J.] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Med Psychol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Cools, Alexander R.] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Psychneuropharmacol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Fernandez, Guillen] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Neurol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands","Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen","de Rover, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Downing Site, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.","md415@cam.ac.uk","GNC, GNC/B-5716-2013; Fernandez, Guillen/B-3771-2009; Petersson, Karl Magnus/HDO-0143-2022; Petersson, Karl Magnus/E-8188-2012","Fernandez, Guillen/0000-0002-5522-0604; Petersson, Karl Magnus/0000-0002-8245-0392; Petersson, Karl Magnus/0000-0002-8245-0392",,,,,81,25,25,0,12,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1065-9471","1097-0193",,"HUM BRAIN MAPP","Hum.

These effects have not been confirmed in humans because of the lack of a non-inva- sive, practical in vivo imaging tool with the ability to detect these changes. Following the successful use of ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy (UBS) to monitor in vivo cell death in breast tumors, we aimed to use UBS to assess the neuro- toxicity of the anesthetic sevoflurane (SEVO) in a non -human primate (NHP) model. Sixteen 2- to 7 -day -old rhesus macaques were exposed for 5 h to SEVO. Ultrasound scanning was done with a phased array transducer on a clinical ultrasound scanner operated at 10 MHz. Data consisting of 10 - 15 frames of radiofrequency (RF) echo signals from coronal views of the thalamus were obtained 0.5 and 6.0 h after initiating exposure. The UBS parameter ?effective scat- terer size?(ESS) was estimated by fitting a scattering form factor (FF) model to the FF measured from RF echo sig- nals. The approach involved analyzing the frequency dependence of the measured FF to characterize scattering sources and selecting the FF model based on a chi(2) goodness -of -fit criterion. To assess data quality, a rigorous acceptance criterion based on the analysis of prevalence of diffuse scattering (an assumption in the estimation of ESS) was estab- lished. ESS changes after exposure to SEVO were compared with changes in a control group of five primates for which ultrasound data were acquired at 0 and 10 min (no apoptosis expected). Over the entire data set, the average measured FF at 0.5 and 6.0 h monotonically decreased with frequency, justifying fitting a single FF over the analysis bandwidth. chi(2) values of a (inhomogeneous continuum) Gaussian FF model were one -fifth those of the discrete fluid sphere model, suggesting that a continuum scatterer model better represents ultrasound scattering in the young rhesus brain. After application of the data quality criterion, only 5 of 16 subjects from the apoptotic group and 5 of 5 subjects from the con- trol group fulfilled the acceptance criteria. All subjects in the apoptotic group that passed the acceptance criterion exhibited a significant ESS reduction at 6.0 h. These changes ( - 6.4%, 95% Interquartile Range: -14.3% to -3.3%) were larger than those in the control group ( - 0.8%, 95% Interquartile Range:- 2.0% to 1.5%]). Data with a low prevalence of diffuse scattering corresponded to possibly biased results. Thus, ESS has the potential to detect changes in brain microstructure related to anesthesia -induced apoptosis.

A fully automated synthesis of (-)-[F-18]flubatine as a sterile isotonic solution suitable for clinical use is reported, as well as the first evaluation in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared by fluorination of the Boc-protected trimethylammonium iodide precursor with [F-18]fluoride in an automated synthesis module. Subsequent deprotection of the Boc group with 1-M HCl yielded (-)-[F-18]flubatine, which was purified by semi-preparative HPLC. (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared in 25% radiochemical yield (formulated for clinical use at end of synthesis, n=3), >95% radiochemical purity, and specific activity=4647Ci/mmol (171.9GBq/mu mol). Doses met all quality control criteria confirming their suitability for clinical use. Evaluation of (-)-[F-18]flubatine in rhesus macaques was performed with a Concorde MicroPET P4 scanner (Concorde MicroSystems, Knoxville, TN). The brain was imaged for 90min, and data were reconstructed using the 3-D maximum a posteriori algorithm. Image analysis revealed higher uptake and slower washout in the thalamus than those in other areas of the brain and peak uptake at 45min. Injection of 2.5 mu g/kg of nifene at 60min initiated a slow washout of [F-18]flubatine, with about 25% clearance from the thalamus by the end of imaging at 90min.

However, association cortices also receive, albeit weak, direct thalamocortical sensory inputs of unknown function. For example, while information proceeds from primary (SI) to secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex in a serial fashion, both areas are known to receive direct thalamocortical sensory input. The present study examines the potential roles of such parallel input arrangements. The subjects were presented with median nerve somatosensory stimuli with the instruction to respond with the contralateral hand. The locations and time courses of the activated brain areas were first identified with magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a subsequent session, these brain areas were modulated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 15-210 ms after the somatosensory stimulus while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. TMS pulses at 15-40 ms post-stimulus significantly speeded up reaction times and somatosensory-evoked responses, with largest facilitatory effects when the TMS pulse was given to contralateral SII at about 20 ms. To explain the results, we propose that the early somatosensory-evoked physiological SII activation exerts an SII -> SI influence that facilitates the reciprocal SI -> SII pathway - with TMS to SII we apparently amplified this mechanism. The results suggest that the human brain may utilize parallel inputs to facilitate long-distance cortico-cortical connections, resulting in accelerated processing and speeded reaction times. This arrangement could also allow very early top- down modulation of the bottom-up stream of sensory information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we acquired five PET scans using a highly selective D2/D3 dopamine antagonist, 18F-fallypride, to track changes in dopamine receptor availability, as measured by the distribution volume ratio (DVR), through the course of DBS in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in a nonhuman primate. Methods: PET scans were performed on a rhesus monkey with unilateral BNST stimulation during periods of baseline, chronic high frequency (130 Hz) and low frequency (50 Hz) DBS stimulation, and during a washout period between stimulation periods. A final scan was performed with the electrode stimulation starting 110 min into the scan. Whole brain parametric images of 18F-fallypride DVR were calculated for each condition to track changes in both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 availability. Results: The monkey displayed significant increases in receptor binding throughout the brain during DBS relative to baseline for 130 and 50 Hz, with changes in DVR of: caudate 42%, 51%; putamen 56%, 57%; thalamus 33%,49%; substantia nigra 29%,26%; and prefrontal cortex 28%, 56%, respectively. Washout and post-stimulation scans revealed DVR values close to baseline values. Activating the stimulator midway through the final scan resulted in no statistically significant changes in binding. Conclusions: PET neuroligand imaging has demonstrated the sensitivity to track changes in dopamine D2/D3 binding during the course of DBS. These methods show great potential for providing insight into the neurochemical consequences of DBS. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Another group of three monkeys was exposed to HgCl2 i.v. for 3 months. Total and inorganic mercury concentrations in occipital pole and thalamus were determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. Selenium concentrations were analyzed by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy, The results indicated an association between concentrations of inorganic mercury and selenium in both occipital pole and thalamus in the MeHg-exposed animals, A linear regression model using concentrations of inorganic mercury (nmol/g wet wt) as independent variable, and selenium concentrations (nmol/g wet wt) as the dependent variable showed significant correlations between the variables in both occipital pole and thalamus (r = 0.85 and r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). The intercept of the regression line was slightly lower (about 2 nmol Se/g wet wt) than the selenium concentrations found in control monkeys (about 3 nmol Se/g wet wt). There was a tendency to a ''hockey stick''-shaped relationship between concentrations of selenium and inorganic mercury in the thalamus of monkeys with ongoing exposure to MeHg. An important role for selenium in the retention of mercury in brain is indicated.","UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH MED,DEPT PATHOL & ENVIRONM HLTH,SEATTLE,WA 98195; KAROLINSKA INST,CLIN RES CTR,APPL BIOCHEM UNIT,S-14157 HUDDINGE,SWEDEN; UNIV TEXAS,INST BIOMED RES,AUSTIN,TX 78712","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Karolinska Institutet; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","BJORKMAN, L (corresponding author), KAROLINSKA INST,INST ENVIRONM MED,POB 210,S-17177 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,"Vahter, Marie/HGB-1674-2022",,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR 00166] Funding Source: Medline; NIEHS NIH HHS [R01 ES05011] Funding Source: Medline","NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIEHS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS))",,,32,41,42,0,5,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0340-5761",,,"ARCH TOXICOL","Arch.

As iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes inmagnetic relaxation (T2/T2'), is often prone, however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity. Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus, reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Central sensory processing uses also rate coding, and motor outputs appear to be primarily encoded by rate. I propose here a simple, efficient structure, converting temporal coding to rate coding by neuronal phase-locked loops (PLL). The simplest form of a PLL includes a phase detector (that is, a neuronal-plausible version of an ideal coincidence detector) and a controllable local oscillator that are connected in a negative feedback loop. The phase detector compares the firing times of the local oscillator and the input and provides an output whose firing rate is monotonically related to the time difference. The output rate is fed back to the local oscillator and forces it to phase-lock to the input. Every temporal interval at the input is associated with a specific pair of output rate and time difference values; the higher the output rate, the further the local oscillator is driven from its intrinsic frequency. Sequences of input intervals, which by definition encode input information, are thus represented by sequences of firing rates at the PLL's output. The most plausible implementation of PLL circuits is by thalamocortical loops in which populations of thalamic relay neurons function as phase detectors that compare the timings of cortical oscillators and sensory signals. The output in this case is encoded by the thalamic population rate. This article presents and analyzes the algorithmic and the implementation levels of the proposed PLL model and describes the implementation of the PLL model to the primate tactile system.","Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Weizmann Institute of Science","Ahissar, E (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",,,,,,,,108,71,73,2,8,"M I T PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","FIVE CAMBRIDGE CENTER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA","0899-7667",,,"NEURAL COMPUT","Neural Comput.","APR 1",1998,10,3,,,,,597,650,,"10.1162/089976698300017683","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976698300017683"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976698300017683"")",,,54,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Neurosciences & Neurology","ZH576",9527836,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000073125300001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000073125300001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We have examined and quantified in primate prefrontal cortex the subcellular distribution of two isoforms of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, which are components of the signal transduction pathway accessed by the D-1 dopamine receptor. Both PP1 alpha- and PP1 gamma1-labeled puncta are seen in cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and thalamus. Viewed with the electron microscope, both PP1 isoforms are selectively localized to dendritic spines and are found in different percentages of spines; PP1 alpha is present in roughly 70% and PP1 gamma1 in roughly 40% of dendritic spines. Our analysis indicates that three populations of spines are defined by the distribution of these PP1 isoforms: those that contain both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, those that contain only PP1 alpha and those that contain neither. The D-1 receptor is present in a subset of the population that contains both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1. The nonhomogeneous distribution of signal transduction proteins in the spines and dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells may help to explain differences in the actions of receptors that nominally use the same signal-transduction pathway.

Responsiveness within the hand region of the second somatosensory area of cortex (SII) was investigated in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in association with cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the primary somatosensory area, SI. The aims were to determine whether thalamocortical systems in this primate species are organized according to a serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII as the next hierarchical level of processing and to establish whether primates are fundamentally different, in this respect, from mammals in which tactile information is conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII. 2. Inactivation of the SI hand area was achieved when the temperature at the face of the silver cooling block over this SI region was lowered to less than or equal to 13 degrees C. Inactivation was confirmed by abolition of the SI surface potential evoked by a brief tap stimulus to the hand and by the abolition of responsiveness in single SI neurons located beneath and around the edge of the block. 3. The effect of SI inactivation on SII-evoked potentials was investigated in 20 experiments by simultaneous recording of the SI- and SII-evoked potentials. The SII response was never abolished and was unchanged in the majority (12/20) of experiments. In the remainder, the SII-evoked potentials underwent a reduction in amplitude that was usually <30% but never >50%. 4. Tactile responsiveness was examined quantitatively in 47 individual SII neurons of different functional classes before, during, and after the inactivation of SI. Controlled tactile stimuli consisted of trains of sinusoidal vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the glabrous or hairy skin of the hand. 5. Thirteen of the 47 SII neurons (28%) were unaffected in their response levels in association with SI inactivation. The remaining 34 SII neurons underwent some reduction in responsiveness, but in only 6% (3/47) was responsiveness abolished by SI inactivation. As the same range of functional classes of tactile neurons were represented among the affected and unaffected SII neurons, there was no evidence for a differential susceptibility among SII tactile neurons to the effect of SI inactivation. 6. Where reductions in amplitude of the SII-evoked potential or in response levels of SII neurons were observed, the effects were not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SI to the SII hand area as there was no cooling-induced prolongation of either the evoked potential or spike waveform in SII, an effect that is known to precede cooling-induced reductions in responsiveness. 7. These lines of evidence indicate that reductions in SII responsiveness in association with SI inactivation may be attributable to a loss of a background facilitatory influence rather than to a blockage of a component of peripheral input that comes over a putative serial path to SII via SI. First, as SI was cooled, there was a progressive increase in latency and time course of the SI responses before their disappearance, but no comparable delay in the SII responses as might be expected if SI were placed earlier than SII in a strict hierarchical scheme of thalamocortical processing. Second, SI inactivation failed to bring about a tightening in the phase-locking of SII responses to vibrotactile stimuli as might have been expected if the inputs to the SII neurons come via both a direct path from the thalamus and an indirect intracortical path via SI. Blockage of the indirect intracortical pathway through SI might be expected to reduce temporal dispersion in the input to SII neurons and result in an improvement in phase-locking in the SII responses to skin vibration. Third, the background activity of some SII neurons was reduced during SI inactivation along with the reduction in their responses to tactile stimulation. If this background activity is endogenous to SII and not generated by afferent drive that comes via SI, it appears that the inactivation removes a source of background facilitation that arises in SI and affects a proportion of SII neurons. 8. In conclusion, the retention of tactile responsiveness in >90% of marmoset SII neurons in association with SI inactivation demonstrates that within this primate species, tactile inputs can reach SII without traversing an indirect, serially organized path through SI. The results establish that in the marmoset monkey, as in nonprimate species, there is a parallel organization of the SI and Sn areas for tactile processing and therefore necessitate a revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which signals are conveyed from the thalamus to SI, and thence to SII. The results indicate that there is no longer justification for the view that there are fundamental differences between simian primates, in general, and other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems that supply SI and SII.","UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA","University of New South Wales Sydney",,,,,,,,,85,78,78,0,9,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Neurons in dorsal column nuclei respond primarily to innocuous somatic inputs, but noxious stimulation of pelvic viscera activates gracile neurons. The purpose of this study was to compare effects of thoracic visceral input on cuneothalamic and STT neurons. Stellate ganglia of 17 anesthetized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were stimulated electrically to activate cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers. Somatic receptive fields were manipulated with brush, tap, and pinch stimuli. Extracellular discharge rate nias recorded for neurons antidromically activated from ventroposterolateral (VPL) thalamus. Stimulation of the ipsilateral stellate ganglion increased activity of 17 of 35 cuneothalamic neurons and of 1 gracilothalamic neuron with an upper body somatic field. Spinal cord transections showed that cardiopulmonary input to cuneothalamic neurons traveled in ipsilateral dorsal column and probably in dorsolateral funiculus. One of eight gracilothalamic neurons with lower body fields was inhibited by cardiopulmonary input, and none were excited. Stimulation of the ipsilateral stellate ganglion increased activity in 10 of 10 T-3-T-4 STT neurons. Evoked discharge rates, latencies to activation and durations of peristimulus histogram peaks were significantly less for cuneothalamic neurons compared with STT neurons. Furthermore, additional long latency peaks of activity developed in histograms for 6 of 10 STT neurons but never for cuneothalamic neurons. Contralateral cardiopulmonary sympathetic input did not excite cuneothalamic neurons but increased activity of 7 of 10 T-3-T-4 STT neurons. Most cuneothalamic neurons (24 of 31 cells tested) responded primarily to innocuous somatic stimuli, whereas STT neurons responded primarily or solely to noxious pinch of somatic fields. Neurons chat responded to cardiopulmonary input most often had somatic fields located on proximal arm and chest. Results of this study showed that cardiopulmonary input was transmitted in dorsal pathways to cuneate nucleus and then to VPL thalamus and confirmed that STT neurons transmit nociceptive cardiopulmonary input to VPL thalamus. Differences in neuronal responses to noxious stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers suggest that dorsal and ventrolateral pathways to VPL thalamus play different roles in the transmission and integration of nociceptive cardiac information.","Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Physiol, Oklahoma City, OK 73190 USA","University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center","Chandler, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Physiol, POB 26901, Oklahoma City, OK 73190 USA.",,,,"NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-52986, HL-22732] Funding Source: Medline","NHLBI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))",,,39,11,11,0,5,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

To this day, our understanding of the visual system in mammals beyond the few studied animal models remains limited. In the present study, we examined the primary visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls that live on land (sheep, Pere David deer, giraffe); in the sea (bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, long-finned pilot whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale and fin whale); or in an amphibious environment (hippopotamus). We also sampled and studied the visual cortex of the horse (a closely related perissodactyl) and two primates (chimpanzee and pig-tailed macaque) for comparison. Our histochemical and immunohistochemical results indicate that the visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls is characterized by a peculiar organization, structure, and complexity of the cortical column. We noted a general lesser lamination compared to simians, with diminished density, and an apparent simplification of the intra- and extra-columnar connections. The presence and distribution of calcium-binding proteins indicated a notable absence of parvalbumin in water species and a strong reduction of layer 4, usually enlarged in the striated cortex, seemingly replaced by a more diffuse distribution in neighboring layers. Consequently, thalamo-cortical inputs are apparently directed to the higher layers of the column. Computer analyses and statistical evaluation of the data confirmed the results and indicated a substantial correlation between eye placement and cortical structure, with a markedly segregated pattern in cetaceans compared to other mammals. Furthermore, cetacean species showed several types of cortical lamination which may reflect differences in function, possibly related to depth of foraging and consequent progressive disappearance of light, and increased importance of echolocation.","[Graic, Jean-Marie; Peruffo, Antonella; Cozzi, Bruno] Univ Padua, Dept Comparat Biomed & Food Sci, Viale Univ 16 Legnaro, I-35020 Padua, PD, Italy; [Corain, Livio] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy; [Finos, Livio] Univ Padua, Dept Dev Psychol & Socializat, Padua, Italy; [Grisan, Enrico] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy; [Grisan, Enrico] London South Bank Univ, Sch Engn, London SE1 0AA, England","University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua; London South Bank University","Graic, JM (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Comparat Biomed & Food Sci, Viale Univ 16 Legnaro, I-35020 Padua, PD, Italy.","jeanmarie.graic@unipd.it","Grisan, Enrico/K-9381-2016; Finos, Livio/AAQ-6411-2020; Graïc, Jean-Marie/I-2710-2019","Grisan, Enrico/0000-0002-7365-5652; Finos, Livio/0000-0003-3181-8078; Graïc, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-1974-8356; Cozzi, Bruno/0000-0002-7531-7040; Peruffo, Antonella/0000-0003-0454-9087; CORAIN, LIVIO/0000-0002-8104-1255","Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement","Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement","Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.",,175,3,3,1,2,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1863-2653","1863-2661",,"BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT","Brain Struct.

However, equilibrium binding assays alone have not permitted a clear demonstration of the localization of putative Ml, M2, and M3 receptor subtypes in the brain because of the overlapping affinities of virtually all muscarinic antagonists. In the present study, the conditions for selective occupancy of the Ml, M2, and M3 receptor subtypes in the brain of the rhesus monkey were based on the distinct kinetic and equilibrium binding properties of N-[H-3]-methylscopolamine (NMS) at cloned ml-m4 muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in A9L transfected cells. Quantitatitve autoradiography of the Ml, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subytpes in the primate brain was performed according to the following strategy. The Ml (ml) receptor subtype was labeled directly with a non-saturating concentration of [H-3]-pirenzepine. The M2 (m2) subtype was labeled by incubations consisting of short, two minute pulses of [H-3]-NMS after a preincubation with 0.3 muM pirenzepine to occlude ml, m3, and m4 sites. Selective occupancy of the M3 (m3) receptor (subtype) was achieved by pre-incubation with 0.5 nM unlabeled NMS to partially occlude the ml, m2, and m4 sites, equilibrium with 0.5 nM [H-3]-NMS, followed by a 60 minute tracer dissociation in the presence of 1 muM atropine. In vitro autoradiography demonstrated that the Ml receptor subtype was confined to forebrain structures. Ml receptors were prevalent throughout the cerebral cortical mantle, amygdala, hippocampus, and the striatum. Low to background levels of the Ml receptor subtype were measured over the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. The M2 subtype was widely distributed with elevated densities of binding sites seen over all primary sensory cortical areas, and within discrete thalamic, hypothalamic, and brainstem nuclei. The distribution of the M3 receptor subtype was largely coincident with the pattern of the Ml sites labeled by non-saturating concentrations of [H-3]-pirenzepine with some notable exceptions. Within the cerebral cortical mantle, the M3 receptor exhibited an elevated gradient over the orbitofrontal gyrus and the temporal lobe. Within the striatum, the M3 subtype was elevated over the anterior and dorsal part of the caudate nucleus, while the Ml receptors were most prevalent over the ventromedial sector. Selective labeling of M3 receptors was seen over the medial division of the globus pallidus and within the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In contrast to the pattern of the Ml receptor subtype, M3 receptors were prevalent also over midline nuclei of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that the distinct kinetic and equilibrium binding profiles of N-methylscopolamine and pirenzepine for cloned muscarinic receptors provide a viable ligand autoradiographic strategy for mapping the distribution of Ml, M2, and M3 receptors in brain.

In recent studies, we used transneuronal virus tracing techniques to demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum of primates projects via the thalamus not only to its classical motor target, the primary motor cortex, but also to nonmotor cortical areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. We found that dentate neurons projecting to different cortical areas originated from localized regions of the nucleus which we termed output channels. To compare the locations of the output channels projecting to different cortical targets, we have created an unfolded map of the dentate. This unfolded map revealed that dentate output channels were segregated into spatially separate motor and nonmotor domains. The output channels in the motor domain exclusively targeted primary motor and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex. These channels were localized in the dorsal portion of the dentate. The output channels in the nonmotor domain projected to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical areas. The nonmotor domain was confined to the ventral portion of the dentate. In recent studies, we defined a unique molecular marker, monoclonal antibody 8B3. which appears to differentially recognize these two domains. Taken together, our results suggest that dentate output is organized according to the functional capabilities of its cortical targets. This organization provides the dentate nucleus with the anatomical substrate to influence not only the control of movement, but also cognitive, higher-order executive and visuospatial functions.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA)","Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, W1640 Biomed Sci Tower,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.","strickp@pitt.edu",,,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH45156, MH56661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS24328] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,43,99,100,0,7,"NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES","NEW YORK","2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA","0077-8923",,"1-57331-437-4; 1-57331-436-6","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2002,978,,,,,,289,301,,"10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb07575.x","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb07575.x"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb07575.x"")",,,13,"Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology","BW14B",12582061,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000180980000025","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000180980000025"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Despite several studies exploring the somatosensory system of marmosets, all results have come from anesthetized animals using invasive techniques and postmortem analyses. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility for getting high-quality and reproducible somatosensory mapping in awake marmosets with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We acquired fMRI sequences in four animals, while they received tactile stimulation (via air-puffs), delivered to the face, arm, or leg. We found a topographic body representation with the leg representation in the most medial part, the face representation in the most lateral part, and the arm representation between leg and face representation within areas 3a, 3b, and 1/2. A similar sequence from leg to face from caudal to rostral sites was identified in areas S2 and PV. By generating functional connectivity maps of seeds defined in the primary and second somatosensory regions, we identified two clusters of tactile representation within the posterior and midcingulate cortex. However, unlike humans and macaques, no clear somatotopic maps were observed. At the subcortical level, we found a somatotopic body representation in the thalamus and, for the first time in marmosets, in the putamen. These maps have similar organizations, as those previously found in Old World macaque monkeys and humans, suggesting that these subcortical somatotopic organizations were already established before Old and New World primates diverged. Our results show the first whole brain mapping of somatosensory responses acquired in a noninvasive way in awake marmosets. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used somatosensory stimulation combined with functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to reveal the topographic body representation in areas S1, S2, thalamus, and putamen. We showed the existence of a body representation organization within the thalamus and the cingulate cortex by computing functional connectivity maps from seeds defined in S1/S2, using resting-state fMRI data. This noninvasive approach will be essential for chronic studies by guiding invasive recording and manipulation techniques.","[Clery, Justine C.; Hori, Yuki; Schaeffer, David J.; Gati, Joseph S.; Pruszynski, J.

Methods: Carbon-11 was introduced into HOMADAM by preparation of N-methyl -2- (2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzylamine followed by alkylation with carbon-11 iodomethane. Binding affinities of HOMADAM and the radiolabeling substrate, N-methyl-2-(2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzylamine, were determined in cDNA transfected cells expressing human SERT, dopamine transporters (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters NET using [H-3]citalopram, [I-125]RTI-55 and [H-3]nisoxetine, respectively. MicroPET brain imaging was performed in monkeys. Arterial plasma metabolites of HOMADAM were analyzed in a rhesus monkey by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: HOMADAM displayed high affinity for the SERT (K-i=0.6 nM). N-methyl-2-(2-amino-4-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzyiamine displayed moderate affinity for the SERT (K-i = 15.11 nM). The affinities of HOMADAM for the DAT and NET were 2000- and 253-fold lower, respectively, than for the SERT. [C-11]HOMADAM was prepared from [C-11]iodomethane in approximately 25% radiochemical yield (decay-corrected to end of bombardment). MicroPET brain imaging studies in monkeys demonstrated that [C-11]HOMADAM uptake was selectively localized in the raidbrain, thalamus, pons, caudate, putamen and medulla. The inidbrain-to-cerebellum, pons-to-cerebellum, thalamus-to-cerebellum and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios at 85 min were 4.2, 2.8, 2.3 and 2.0, respectively. HOMADAM binding achieved quasi-equilibrium at 45 min. Radioactivity in the SERT-rich regions of monkey brain was displaceable with R,S-citalopram. Radioactivity in the DAT-rich regions of monkey brain was not displaceable with the DAT ligand RTI-113. Radioactivity in the SERT-rich regions of monkey brain was displaceable with the R,S-reboxetine, a NET ligand with a high nanomolar affinity for SERT. Arterial plasma metabolites of HOMADAM were analyzed in a rheses monkey by HPLC and displayed a single peak that corresponded to unmetabolized HOMADAM. Conclusion: HOMADAM is an excellent candidate for PET primate imaging of brain SERTs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, these subdivisions show no correlation with those established by electrophysiological, immunocytochemical, or neuroanatomical tracer studies. In this work, we studied the connections of the pulvinar nucleus of Cebus monkey with visual areas V1, V2, V4, MT, and PO by means of retrograde fluorescent tracers injected into these areas. Based on the projection zones to cortical visual areas, the visual portion of the pulvinar. of Cebus monkey was subdivided into three subregions: P1, P2, and P3, similar to those described in the macaque (Ungerleider ct al., 1984). In Cebus, P1 includes the centrolateral portion of traditionally defined PI and adjacent portion of FL. P? is located in the dorsal portion of PL and P3 includes the medial portion of FI and extends dorsally into adjacent PL and PM. In addition, eve studied the histology of the pulvinar using multiple criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture; histochemistry for cytochrome oxidase, NADPH-diaphorase, and acetylcholinesterase; and immunocytochemistry for two calcium-binding proteins, calbindin and parvalbumin, and for a neurofilament recognized by the SMI-32 antibody. Some of these stains, mainly calbindin, showed additional subdivisions of the Cebus pulvinar, beyond the traditional PI, FL, and PM. Based on this immunohistochemical staining, the border of PI is moved dorsally above the brachium of the superior colliculus and PI can be subdivided in five regions (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PILS).

The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in Al and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area Al in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in Al indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.","Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, H-1394 Budapest, Hungary; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Columbia University","Schroeder, CE (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.","schrod@nki.rfmh.org","Chen, Chi-Ming/G-1321-2010","Chen, Chi-Ming/0000-0003-4419-1593; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021","NIMH NIH HHS [MH61989, R01 MH061989] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,59,689,697,2,59,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0896-6273","1097-4199",,"NEURON","Neuron","JAN 18",2007,53,2,,,,,279,292,,"10.1016/j.neuron.2006.12.011","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.12.011"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.12.011"")",,,14,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","149DG",17224408,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000245126600012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000245126600012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The results indicate that the orbital and medial networks connect to different striatal regions. The ventromedial striatum (the medial caudate nucleus, accumbens nucleus, and ventral putamen) receives input predominantly from the medial PFC (mPFC) and orbital areas 12o, Iai, and 13a, which constitute the medial network. More specifically, caudal medial areas 32, 25, and 14r project to the medial edge of the caudate nucleus, accumbens nucleus, and ventromedial putamen, whereas rostral areas 10o, 10m, and 11m are restricted to the medial edge of the caudate. Projections from orbital areas 12o, 13a, and Iai extend more laterally into the lateral accumbens and the ventral putamen. Area 24 gives rise to a divided pattern of projections, including fibers to the ventromedial striatum, apparently from area 24b, and fibers to the dorsolateral striatum, apparently from area 24c. Other areas of orbital cortex (11l, 12m, 12l, 13m, 13l, Ial, and Iam) that constitute the orbital network project primarily to the central part of the rostral striatum. This region includes the central and lateral parts of the caudate nucleus, and the ventromedial putamen, on either side of the internal capsule. The results support the subdivision of the orbital and medial PFC into medial and orbital networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the PFC rather than topographic location.

Surgical interventions aimed at increasing basal ganglia-thalamic outflow to the cortex, such as electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus with chronically implanted electrodes, have been shown to be effective in improving the clinical symptoms of Parkiuson's disease. This study examined changes in cortical activity, as reflected in the CNV, associated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease, The CNV was recorded from 10 patients with Parkinson's disease when on and off bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, and was compared with the CNV of 10 healthy control subjects. Without subthalamic nucleus stimulation, Parkinson's disease patients showed reduced CNV amplitudes over the frontal and frontocentral regions compared with control subjects. With bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, however, CNV amplitudes over the frontal and frontocentral regions were significantly increased. Results therefore suggest that impaired cortical functioning in Parkinson's disease, particularly within the frontal and premotor areas, is improved by subthalamic nucleus stimulation.","Univ Vienna, Dept Neurol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Dept Neurosurg, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Inst Neurol, MRC, Human Movement & Balance Unit, London WC1N 3BG, England","University of Vienna; University of Vienna; University of London; University College London","Lang, W (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Neurol, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",,"Cunnington, Ross/C-8432-2009; Dirnberger, Georg/F-6030-2010","Cunnington, Ross/0000-0002-7423-4809",,,,,46,70,70,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","DEC",1999,122,,12,,,,2365,2373,,"10.1093/brain/122.12.2365","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/122.12.2365"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/122.12.2365"")",,,9,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","264KP",10581229,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000084181500014","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000084181500014"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

This insectivore shows one of the lowest size indices among mammals for both the cerebellar nuclei and the neocortex. Almost all cerebellodience-phalic target areas found in the tenrec have been described in other mammals. The intensity and extent of particular projections, however, vary considerably in the tenrec compared with the other mammals investigated so far. The most remarkable finding may be the tenrec's cerebellar projection to the nucleus ventralis medialis. This projection is the most prominent cerebellothalamic projection and originates in predominantly the lateral portion of the cerebellar nuclear complex. The projection to the caudolateral portion of the ventralis anterior complex (VAC) is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the intermediate cerebellar nuclear complex. Another cerebellothalamic focus of terminations lies in the paralamellar region of the VAC, whereas the proper intralaminar nuclei, at best, receive a sparse cerebellar input. A faint-to-moderate projection, on the other hand, has been traced consistently to the ventral portion of the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex and the adjacent dorsal geniculate nucleus. In addition, there are prominent cerebellosubthalamic projections to the zona incerta and the ventral geniculate nucleus. The latter projection is confined mainly to the ventralmost subdivision, which has been shown previously to receive ascending somatosensory, but not retinal, afferents. With the exception of the nucleus ventralis medialis, the projections were essentially confined to the contralateral side. J. Comp. Neurol. 402:313-326, 1998.

Combination of these techniques constitutes a novel approach for the collection and analysis of neuroanatomical data. Together, these techniques enable large-scale, and therefore more comprehensive, sampling of selective neuronal populations and establish unbiased quantitative methods for describing morphologically unique neuronal classes within a population. The protocol outlines the use of modified rabies virus to selectively label neurons. G-deleted rabies virus acts like a retrograde tracer following stereotaxic injection into a target brain structure of interest and serves as a vehicle for the delivery and expression of EGFP in neurons. Large numbers of neurons are infected using this technique and express GFP throughout their dendrites, producing Golgi-like complete fills of individual neurons. Accordingly, the virus-mediated retrograde tracing method improves upon traditional dye-based retrograde tracing techniques by producing complete intracellular fills. Individual well-isolated neurons spanning all regions of the brain area under study are selected for reconstruction in order to obtain a representative sample of neurons. The protocol outlines procedures to reconstruct cell bodies and complete dendritic arborization patterns of labeled neurons spanning multiple tissue sections. Morphological data, including positions of each neuron within the brain structure, are extracted for further analysis. Standard programming functions were utilized to perform independent cluster analyses and cluster evaluations based on morphological metrics. To verify the utility of these analyses, statistical evaluation of a cluster analysis performed on 160 neurons reconstructed in the thalamic reticular nucleus of the thalamus (TRN) of the macaque monkey was made. Both the original cluster analysis and the statistical evaluations performed here indicate that TRN neurons are separated into three subpopulations, each with unique morphological characteristics.","[Bragg, Elise M.; Briggs, Farran] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Dartmouth College","Briggs, F (corresponding author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.","Farran.Briggs@dartmouth.edu",,,"NIH [NEI: EY018683]; Whitehall Foundation","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitehall Foundation","We would like to thank Drs.

Using FDG PET data and Structural Equation Modeling, a formal depression model was created to explicitly test current theories of limbic-cortical dysfunction in MDD and to characterize at the path level potential sources of baseline variability reported in this patient population. A 7-region model consisting of lateral prefrontal cortex (latF9), anterior thalamus (aTh), anterior cingulate (Cg24), subgenual cingulate (Cg25), orbital frontal cortex (OF711), hippocampus (Hc), and medial frontal cortex (mF10) was tested in scans of 119 depressed patients and 42 healthy control subjects acquired during three separate studies at two different institutions. A single model, based on previous theory and supported by anatomical connectivity literature, was stable for the three groups of depressed patients. Within the context of this model, path differences among groups as a function of treatment response characteristics were also identified. First, limbic-cortical connections (latF9-Cg25-OF11-Hc) differentiated drug treatment responders from nonresponders. Second, nonresponders showed additional abnormalities in limbic-subcortical pathways (aTh-Cg24-Cg25-OF11-Hc). Lastly, more limited limbic-cortical (Hc-latF9) and cortical-cortical (OF11-mF10) path differences differentiated responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) from responders to pharmacotherapy. We conclude that the creation of such models is a first step toward full characterization of the depression phenotype at the neural systems level, with implications for the future development of brain-based algorithms to determine optimal treatment selection for individual patients.

These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior. This report also introduces a new paradigm for probing the functional integrity of this circuitry in humans.","NIAAA, Sect Brain Electrophysiol & Imaging, Div Intramural Clin & Biol Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)","Knutson, B (corresponding author), NIAAA, Sect Brain Electrophysiol & Imaging, Div Intramural Clin & Biol Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,,"Knutson, Brian/0000-0002-7669-426X",,,,,36,952,961,9,137,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1053-8119",,,"NEUROIMAGE","Neuroimage","JUL",2000,12,1,,,,,20,27,,"10.1006/nimg.2000.0593","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2000.0593"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2000.0593"")",,,8,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","336RX",10875899,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000088317700003","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000088317700003"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recordings in primates during instructed-delay reaching tasks have shown that different types of traveling waves of oscillatory activity are associated with episodes of beta oscillations in motor cortex during movement preparation. We propose here a simple model of motor cortex based on local excitatory-inhibitory neuronal populations coupled by long-range excitation, where additionally inputs to the motor cortex from other neural structures are represented by stochastic inputs on the different model populations. We show that the model accurately reproduces the statistics of recording data when these external inputs are correlated on a short time scale (25 ms) and have two different components, one that targets the motor cortex locally and another one that targets it in a global and synchronized way. The model reproduces the distribution of beta burst durations, the proportion of the different observed wave types, and wave speeds, which we show not to be linked to axonal propagation speed. When the long-range connectivity or the local input targets are anisotropic, traveling waves are found to preferentially propagate along the axis where connectivity decays the fastest. Different from previously proposed mechanistic explanations, the model suggests that traveling waves in motor cortex are the reflection of the dephasing by external inputs, putatively of thalamic origin, of an oscillatory activity that would otherwise be spatially synchronized by recurrent connectivity.","[Kang, Ling; Hakim, Vincent] Univ Paris, Sorbonne Univ, PSL Univ, Lab Phys,Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, Paris, France; [Kang, Ling] East China Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ranft, Jonas] PSL Univ, Inst Biol Ecole Normale Super IBENS, Ecole Normale Super, CNRS, Paris, France","4EU+; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); East China Normal University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)","Hakim, V (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Sorbonne Univ, PSL Univ, Lab Phys,Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, Paris, France.","vincent.hakim@ens.fr",,"Ranft, Jonas/0000-0002-7843-7443; hakim, vincent/0000-0001-7505-8192; KANG, Ling/0000-0001-6532-3773","China Scholarship Council","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","China Scholarship Council Graduate Student Fellowship Ling KangThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,65,0,0,4,4,"eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD","CAMBRIDGE","SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND","2050-084X",,,"ELIFE","eLife","MAR 14",2023,12,,,,,,,,"e81446","10.7554/eLife.81446","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81446"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.81446"")",,,29,"Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","E4AU4",36917621,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000974994600001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000974994600001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The aspects of motor performance which are most severely affected are the chronology, the time course and the distribution of the activatory inputs to the muscles. The cerebellar control of motor synergies partly depends on the intrinsic organization of the cerebellar cortex, but interconnections between the cerebellum and the cortex, as well as the organization of the cerebello-spinal outputs are also involved. All these elements take part in different ways in the various aspects of motor synergy control. Depending on the type of sensory signals involved in the triggering of co-ordinations, different cortico-cerebello-cortical connections take part in their programming. Those synergies wich are initiated by external sensory signals are triggered by inputs from the dentate and interposed nuclei and transmitted to parietal associative areas 5 and 7. The programming of the synergies induced by internal signals or motivational states involves projections from the dentate nucleus to prefrontal area 9 as well as to the supplementary motor (SMA) and premotor (PM) areas. The distribution of the cerebellar outputs to the muscles participating in motor synergies depends on the organization of the cerebellar circuits projecting to PM and M1 neurones at the origin of the descending pathways. The fastigial and dentate nuclei give off projections to the PM whereby they activate both axial and proximal muscles via bilateral reticulo-spinal pathways, and these nuclei are therefore responsible for synergies which provide for the necessary postural ajustments when limb movements are performed. When voluntary movements are to be performed, the cerebellar efferents from the three cerebellar nuclei to the motor cortex (M1) are able to trigger all the necessary synergies. Since the motor cortex can be subdivided into several representation areas dealing with elementary unidirectional movements performed by a single joint, activating the requisite co-ordinations requires particular patterns of cerebello-thalamo-cortical activation. With these networks, which can be said to constitute the morphological basis of motor synergies, several body representation cortical areas can be activated simultaneously. These networks seem to be partly set up before birth ; but they may also be shaped during the early stages of life. They are still adaptable during adult-hood, and they can undergo synaptic and functional changes in response to the sensory constraints imposed by the environment.",,,"RISPALPADEL, L (corresponding author), UNIV TOULOUSE 3, FAC MED, CNRS, CTR RECH CERVEAU & COGNIT, 133 ROUTE NARBONNE, F-31062 TOULOUSE, FRANCE.",,,,,,,,88,13,13,0,0,"MASSON EDITEUR","MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9","21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE","0035-3787","2213-0004",,"REV NEUROL-FRANCE","Rev.

Here we investigate whether the functional organization of the voluntary motor system differs between PD patients with and without resting tremor, and whether these differences relate to the cerebral circuit producing tremor. We compared 18 PD patients with marked tremor, 20 PD patients without tremor, and 19 healthy controls. Subjects performed a controlled motor imagery task during fMRI scanning. We quantified imagery-related cerebral activity by contrasting imagery of biomechanically difficult and easy movements. Tremor-related activity was identified by relating cerebral activity to fluctuations in tremor amplitude, using electromyography during scanning. PD patients with tremor had better behavioral performance than PD patients without tremor. Furthermore, tremulous PD patients showed increased imagery-related activity in somatosensory area 3a, as compared with both healthy controls and to nontremor PD patients. This effect was independent from tremor-related activity, which was localized to the motor cortex, cerebellum, and thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). The VIM, with known projections to area 3a, was unique in showing both tremor- and imagery-related responses. We conclude that parkinsonian tremor influences motor imagery by modulating central somatosensory processing through the VIM. This mechanism may explain clinical differences between PD patients with and without tremor. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

Data are entered into the database by drawing injection and label sites from a particular tracer study directly onto canonical representations of the neuroanatomical structures of interest, along with providing descriptive text information. Searches may then be performed on the data by querying the database graphically, for example by specifying a region of interest within the brain for which connectivity information is desired, or via text information, such as keywords describing a particular brain region, or an author name or reference. Analyses may also be performed by accumulating data across multiple studies and displaying a colour-coded map that graphically represents the total evidence for connectivity between regions. Thus, data may be studied and compared free of areal boundaries (which often vary from one laboratory to the next), and instead with respect to standard landmarks, such as the position relative to well-known neuroanatomical substrates or stereotaxic coordinates. If desired, areal boundaries may also be defined by the user to facilitate the interpretation of results. We demonstrate the application of the database to the analysis of pulvinar-cortical connections in the macaque monkey, for which the results of over 120 neuroanatomical experiments were entered into the database.

These areas occupy the lateral and suprasylvian gyri, from the cingulate sulcus (medially) to the suprasylvian sulcus (laterally) and lie between visual areas 18 and 21 (posteriorly) and the somatosensory areas (anteriorly). Within both areas a coarse representation of the visual field was found and within PPr there was also a representation of the body. Each representation mirrors those within neighboring areas. Cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic fields within this cortical region did not correspond in any simple way to the physiological representations. The architectonic differences correlate to differential callosal connectivity, with predominant connectivity corresponding to the upper hemifield/head representations. PPr and PPc receive thalamic projections from a different, but overlapping, complement of thalamic nuclei. The superimposition of somatic and visual maps in PPr might relate to the probable role of this area in transforming retinal-centered to body-centered spatial coordinates. The organization of the parietal areas in the ferret resembles that of the flying fox and might unveil a common organizational plan from which the primate posterior parietal cortex evolved.","Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Div Neuroanat & Brain Dev, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Karolinska Institutet","Innocenti, GM (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Div Neuroanat & Brain Dev, Retzius Vag 8, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.","giorgio.innocenti@neuro.ki.se","Masiello, Italo/C-6114-2019","Masiello, Italo/0000-0002-3738-7945",,,,,61,66,66,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

We have addressed this issue by examining the topography of developing projections to area 17 in the cat. At different postnatal ages, paired injections of the retrograde tracers diamidino yellow and fast blue were made in area 17. Interinjection separations were carefully controlled and the spatial distribution of the two populations of labelled neurones investigated. Projections to the striate cortex from the lateral geniculate nucleus, area 18, as well as connections intrinsic to area 17 were analysed quantitatively with a graphic method that uses a two-dimensional model of the projection. This allows two parameters of the projection to be calculated: the divergence (the spatial extent of area 17 contacted by an infinitely small region of an afferent structure) and the convergence (the extent of an afferent structure that projects to an infinitely small region of area 17). During postnatal development, the bulk of the connections making up the geniculostriate and corticocortical pathways showed no Variation either in their convergence and divergence. However, the projection of area 18 to area 17 and the intrinsic area 17 connections (but not the geniculostriate projection) in the 3-15-day-old kittens were each found to contain a small subpopulation of widely scattered neurones with widespread axonal trajectories. These results, showing that many initially formed connections display a high degree of topographical order, are discussed in terms of the control mechanisms specifying axonal trajectories during development.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and the subjacent ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified scattered STT terminal bursts and a dense terminal field, respectively. In cases with small or medium-sized injections in VPL, labeled STT cells were located almost entirely in lamina V (in spinal segments consistent with the mediolateral VPL topography); few cells were labeled in lamina 1 (< 8%) and essentially none in lamina VII. Large and very large injections in VPL produced marked increases in labeling in lamina I, associated first with spread into VPI and next into the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo), and abundant labeling in lamina VII, associated with spread into the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus. Small injections restricted to VPI labeled many STT cells in laminae I and V with an anteroposterior topography. These observations indicate that VPL receives STT input almost entirely from lamina V neurons, whereas VPI receives STT input from both laminae I and V cells, with two different topographic organizations. Together with the preceding observation that STT input to VMpo originates almost entirely from lamina 1, these findings provide strong evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.","Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA","Barrow Neurological Institute","Craig, AD (corresponding author), Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, 350 W rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.","bcraig@chw.edu",,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS41287, NS25616] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,62,34,35,0,8,"WILEY-LISS","HOBOKEN","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

The activities of single SNr neurons were studied extracellulary in awake monkeys. SNr neurons showed excitatory and/or inhibitory responses to cortical stimulation. These responses were considered to be mediated by the subthalamic nucleus and striatum, respectively. The neurons receiving inhibitory input from the motor, premotor and supplementary motor areas (Motor-related cortical areas) were located in the lateral part of the SNr, whereas those with input from the medial, dorsal and orbital areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFmdo) were frequently found in the rostro-medial part of this nucleus. SNr neurons with inhibitory input from the ventral periprincipal area (PSv) were mainly distributed in the intermedio-lateral portion, with some degree of overlap with input from other cortical areas. The distribution of the excitatory input was almost similar to that of inhibitory one, but the excitatory input from the PSv was much stronger than that from the PFmdo. Some SNr neurons receiving cortical input were proved to project to the thalamus. Our results support the existence of several parallel organization of the cortico-basal ganglia loop circuits [G.E.

Because the reactivation of deprived hand cortex by the face inputs could depend on axonal connections across the hand-face border, we determined the extent of such connections in New World marmosets, owl monkeys, and squirrel monkeys. Small injections of anatomic tracers were placed in the hand or the face representations after these representations were identified by microelectrode recordings. The positions of retrogradely labeled neurons were plotted in processed brain sections cut parallel to the brain surface, and their locations were related to anatomic isomorphs of the hand and face representations revealed in adjacent brain sections stained for myelin. In these sections, the hand-face border was clearly visualized as a myelin-poor septum. The intrinsic connections of area 3b labeled by injections in either the hand or face representations were almost completely confined to their respective representation, and very few neurons projected across the border. In addition, neurons in the somatosensory thalamus labeled by injections in either face or hand representations were confined to either VPM, representing the face, or the hand subnucleus of VPL. Thus the reactivation of hand cortex by face stimulation does not depend on a previously existing network of intrinsic cortical connections across the hand-face border, or mismatched thalamocortical projections.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA","Vanderbilt University","Kaas, JH (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 David K Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",,"Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010","Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850","NINDS NIH HHS [NS16446] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,43,46,48,0,1,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

In the first experiment, lamina I STT neurons in macaque monkeys were double-labeled for calbindin and for retrogradely transported WGA* HRP following large (n = 2) or small (n = 1) injections that included the posterior thalamus. Most, but not all (78%) of the contralateral retrogradely labeled lamina I STT cells were positive for calbindin. Calbindin-immunoreactivity was not selectively associated with any particular anatomical type of lamina I STT cell; 82% of the fusiform cells, 78% of the pyramidal cells and 67% of the multipolar cells were double-labeled. In the second experiment, oblique transverse sections from upper cervical spinal segments of three macaque monkeys, one squirrel monkey and five humans were stained for calbindin-immunoreactivity. In each case, a distinct bundle of fibers was densely stained in the middle of the lateral funiculus. This matches the location of anterogradely labeled ascending lamina I axons observed in prior work in cats and monkeys, and it matches the location of the classically described 'lateral spinothalamic tract' in humans. This bundle had variable shape across cases, an observation that might have clinical significance. These findings support the view that lamina I STT neurons are involved in spinal cordotomies that reduce pain, temperature and itch sensations.

In order to begin to understand the cellular interactions that are important in cortical target selection by thalamic axons, we have examined the morphology of axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as they navigate their way to the primary visual cortex. The morphology of geniculocortical axons was revealed by placing the lipophilic tracer Dil into the LGN of paraformaldehyde-fixed brains from fetal and neonatal cats between embryonic day 26 (E26; gestation is 65 d) and postnatal day 7 (P7). This morphological approach has led to three major observations. (1) As LGN axons grow within the intermediate zone of the telencephalon toward future visual cortex (E30-40), many give off distinct interstitial axon collaterals that penetrate the subplate of nonvisual cortical areas. These collaterals are transient and are not seen postnatally. (2) There is a prolonged period during which LGN axons are restricted to the visual subplate prior to their ingrowth into the cortical plate; the first LGN axons arrive within visual subplate by E36 but are not detected in layer 6 of visual cortex until about E50. (3) Within the visual subplate, LGN axons extend widespread terminal branches. This represents a marked change in their morphology from the simple growth cones present earlier as LGN axons navigate en route to visual cortex. The presence of interstitial collaterals suggests that there may be ongoing interactions between LGN axons and subplate neurons along the entire intracortical route traversed by the axons. From the extensive branching of LGN axons within the visual subplate during the waiting period, it appears that they are not simply ''waiting.'' Rather, LGN axons may participate in dynamic cellular interactions within the subplate long before they contact their ultimate target neurons in layer 4. These observations confirm the existence of a prolonged waiting period in the development of thalamocortical connections and provide important morphological evidence in support of the previous suggestion that interactions between thalamic axons and subplate neurons are necessary for cortical target selection.","STANFORD UNIV, MED CTR, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROBIOL, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University",,,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY02858] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD07249] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))",,,63,197,198,0,1,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Transcranial passive cavitation detection (PCD) provides methodology for monitoring the treatment in real time, but the skull effects remain a major challenge for its translation to the clinic. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity, reliability, and limitations of PCD through primate (macaque and human) skulls in vitro. The results were further correlated with the in vivo macaque studies including the transcranial PCD calibration and real-time monitoring of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, with magnetic resonance imaging assessing the opening and safety. The stable cavitation doses using harmonics (SCDh) and ultraharmonics (SCDu), the inertial cavitation dose (ICD), and the cavitation SNR were quantified based on the PCD signals. Results showed that through the macaque skull, the pressure threshold for detecting the SCDh remained the same as without the skull in place, whereas it increased for the SCDu and ICD; through the human skull, it increased for all cavitation doses. The transcranial PCD was found to be reliable both in vitro and in vivo when the transcranial cavitation SNR exceeded the 1-dB detection limit through the in vitro macaque (attenuation: 4.92 dB/mm) and human (attenuation: 7.33 dB/mm) skull. In addition, using long pulses enabled reliable PCD monitoring and facilitate BBB opening at low pressures. The in vivo results showed that the SCDh became detectable at pressures as low as 100 kPa; the ICD became detectable at 250 kPa, although it could occur at lower pressures; and the SCDu became detectable at 700 kPa and was less reliable at lower pressures. Real-time monitoring of PCD was further implemented during BBB opening, with successful and safe opening achieved at 250 to 600 kPa in both the thalamus and the putamen. In conclusion, this study shows that transcranial PCD in macaques in vitro and in vivo, and in humans in vitro, is reliable by improving the cavitation SNR beyond the 1-dB detection limit.","[Wu, Shih-Ying; Tung, Yao-Sheng; Marquet, Fabrice; Downs, Matthew Eric; Sanchez, Carlos Sierra; Chen, Cherry Chen; Konofagou, Elisa] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Downs, Matthew Eric] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Ferrera, Vincent] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Konofagou, Elisa] Columbia Univ, Dept Radiol, New York, NY USA","Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University","Wu, SY (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.","ek2191@columbia.edu",,"Ferrera, Vincent/0000-0002-6599-7740; Downs, Matthew/0000-0001-6115-3156","National Institutes of Health [R01 AG038961, R01 EB009041]; Wallace H.

Design: Functional and structural neuroimaging using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Setting: University medical center research facility. Patients: Three patients with complete homonymous hemianopia after acute infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery. Main Outcome Measures: Anatomical location of activated structures during horizontal optokinetic stimulation and T-2-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Occipitotemporal cortical areas (Brodmann areas 39 and 40) were the only activated cortical structures that showed statistically significant (P < .01) activation on the affected hemisphere. Of the subcortical areas, activation of thalamic nuclei appeared to be missing on the affected side, whereas the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus) were bilaterally activated. Conclusions: Bilateral activation of the basal ganglia confirms the concept of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loop and of the efference copy of oculomotor pathways from each hemisphere. Our findings suggest 2 possible explanations for the activation of occipitotemporal areas (the human homolog of middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas) on the infarcted hemisphere: involvement of direct extrastriatal visual pathways or interhemispheric callosal connections between right and left middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neuroradiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany","University of Munich; University of Munich","Brandt, T (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,31,39,39,0,1,"AMER MEDICAL ASSOC","CHICAGO","515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA","0003-9942",,,"ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO","Arch.

Behav. Brain Res. 20, 249-261, 1986) indicated that ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which receives thalamic projections from the limbo-diencephalic system, is critical for visual recognition; whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which receives no such thalamic projections, makes little or no contribution to this type of memory. In the present study, we examined the role in recognition of another prefrontal area outside the thalamic projection zone of the limbo-diencephalic system, namely, the inferior prefrontal convexity. In the first experiment, monkeys with lesions of this cortex (Group IC) were found to be impaired in relearning delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS), but not on the subsequent DNMS performance test in which memory demands were greatly increased. In a second experiment, monkeys with combined lesions of the inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Group LAT) were also found to be impaired in relearning DNMS, but in this case they were impaired, in addition, on the subsequent performance test. Neither group (IC or LAT) showed retardation in acquiring visual discrimination habits. Analysis of the DNMS behavior of both groups suggested that their deficits on this task were due not to a loss in recognition memory, but to various forms of perseverative interference. The results support the view that the inferior prefrontal convexity, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lies outside the limbo-diencephalic memory system not only anatomically but also functionally.","NIMH,NEUROPSYCHOL LAB,BLDG 9,ROOM 1N107,BETHESDA,MD 20892; M NENCKI INST EXPTL BIOL,DEPT NEUROPHYSIOL,PL-02093 WARSAW,POLAND","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Polish Academy of Sciences; Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences",,,,,,,,,33,114,115,0,0,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB","0028-3932",,,"NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","Neuropsychologia",,1991,29,6,,,,,583,600,,"10.1016/0028-3932(91)90012-W","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0028-3932(91)90012-W"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0028-3932(91)90012-W"")",,,18,"Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology","GB346",1944863,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1991GB34600012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1991GB34600012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The aim of this study was to determine whether the existence of this projection could be confirmed unambiguously using electrophysiological methods and, if so, to determine the response characteristics of primate spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons. Fifteen neurons in the lumbar enlargement of macaque monkeys were antidromically activated using low-amplitude current pulses in the contralateral hypothalamus. The points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were found in the supraoptic decussation (n = 13) or in the medial hypothalamus (n = 2). Recording points were located in the superficial dorsal horn (n = 1), deep dorsal horn (n = 10), and intermediate zone (n = 4). Each of the 12 examined neurons had cutaneous receptive fields on the ipsilateral hindlimb. All neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli, suggesting that the transmission of nociceptive information is an important role of primate SHT axons. Twelve SHT neurons were also antidromically activated from the thalamus. Tn all cases, the antidromic latency from the thalamus was shorter than that from the hypothalamus, suggesting that the axons pass through the thalamus then enter the hypothalamus. These results confirm the existence of a SHT in primates and suggest that this projection may contribute to the production of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and emotional responses to noxious stimuli in primates, possibly including humans.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Grad Program Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Giesler, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Cell Biol & Neuroanat, 4-102 Owre Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,"NIDA NIH HHS [DA-09641] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCR NIH HHS [DE-07288] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-25932] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIDCR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,16,17,17,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Here we report the synthesis of a novel PET radioligand, [(11)C]AZ10419369 (5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide), for in vivo visualization of 5-HT1B receptors in the brains of macaques and humans subjects. [(11)C]AZ10419369 was prepared by N-methylation of (8-(1-piperazinyl)5- methylchrom-2-en-4-one-2-(4-morpholinophenyl) carboxamide, using carbon-11 methyl triflate. Regional brain uptake patterns of [(11)C]AZ10419369 were characterized by PET measurements in two macaques and a preliminary study in two human subjects. In addition, AZ10419369 was prepared in tritium labeled form for in vitro autoradiography studies in macaque brain tissue sections. The radiochemical purity of [(11)C]AZ10419369 was >99% and specific radioactivity was >3600 Ci/ mmol. After iv injection of [(11)C]AZ10419369, 3-4% was in brain after 7.5 min. The regional brain distribution of radioactivity was similar in humans and macaques showing the highest uptake of radioactivity in the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia, in accord with autoradiographic studies performed using [(3)H]AZ10419369. Uptake was moderate in the temporal and frontal cortical regions, lower in the thalamus and lowest in the cerebellum. In macaques pre-treated with the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist, AR-A000002, binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with specific binding to 5-HT(1B) receptors. These data support [11C] AZ10419369 as a suitable radioligand for labeling 5-HT(1B) receptors in the primate brain. This radioligand may be useful in future studies evaluating drug-induced receptor occupancy and measurement of brain 5-HT1B receptor levels in patients with psychiatric disorders.

In macaques and cats, for example, preferred orientations of neurons are organized in a specific pattern, where cells with similar selectivity are clustered in iso-orientation domains. However, the map is not always continuous, and there are pinwheel-like singularities around which all orientations are arranged in an orderly fashion. Although subject of intense investigation for half a century now, it is still not entirely clear how these maps emerge and what function they might serve. Here, we suggest a new model of orientation selectivity that combines the geometry and statistics of clustered thalamocortical afferents to explain the emergence of orientation maps. We show that the model can generate spatial patterns of orientation selectivity closely resembling the maps found in cats or monkeys. Without any additional assumptions, we further show that the pattern of ocular dominance columns is inherently connected to the spatial pattern of orientation.","[Sadeh, Sadra; Rotter, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","University of Freiburg","Rotter, S (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Fac Biol, Hansastr 9a, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.","sadra.sadeh@bcf.uni-freiburg.de; stefan.rotter@biologie.uni-freiburg.de",,"Sadeh, Sadra/0000-0001-8159-5461","German Ministry of Education and Research (BCCN Freiburg) [01GQ0420]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BFNT Freiburg*Tubingen) [01GQ0830]","German Ministry of Education and Research (BCCN Freiburg); German Ministry of Education and Research (BFNT Freiburg*Tubingen)","We thank Almut Schutz for her constructive comments on previous versions of our manuscript.

In neocortex and other laminated structures, a simplified, one-dimensional CSD analysis can be computed by differentiation of voltages sampled at discrete points in a linear array. One-dimensional CSD analysis is a practical and accurate method for defining both regional activity patterns and neural generators of surface-recorded evoked and event-related potentials. In computing the CSD, common practices of differentiating across spatial grids of 200 mum or more and use of spatial smoothing routines help to reduce noise, but severely limit the spatial resolution available to the analysis. High-resolution CSD procedures (i.e., 3 point differentiation using a spatial grid of 100 mum or less) are more suited to identification of processes within individual cortical laminae or sublaminae, but can magnify the contributions of computational artifacts. Despite the inclusion of independent indices of cellular activity (e.g., multiunit activity), both high- and low-resolution analyses may indicate current source and sink configurations for which there is more than one plausible physiological interpretation. In the present study we examined the resolving capacity and pitfalls of common CSD procedures using simulated ensembles of current dipoles. These were positioned and oriented to model the depolarization of lamina 4C stellate cells and thalamocortical afferents in macaque striate cortex. Empirically, the surface N40 appears in association with a CSD configuration which includes current sinks within the thalamorecipient (stellate) subdivisions of lamina 4C and a large current source extending considerably below 4C. Dipole ensemble contributions to the CSD profile were computed and compared to physiological data from this region. Small asymmetries in activation of model stellate laminae were sufficient to produce substantial open field contributions. However, the best fit with empirical CSD profile was found when the simulation included contributions from thalamocortical axons, along with both open and closed field contributions from dual stellate cell sublaminae. High-resolution CSD profiles were shown to be interpretable when computational artifacts characteristic of closed and open fields were identified using a series of differentiation grids.","YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROSCI,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT PEDIAT,BRONX,NY 10461","Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine","TENKE, CE (corresponding author), NYS,INST PSYCHIAT,DEPT BIOPSYCHOL,BOX 50,722 W168 ST,NEW YORK,NY 10032, USA.",,,"Tenke, Craig/0000-0002-0924-4314","NIMH NIH HHS [NIMH MH36295, NIMH MH06723] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,33,61,61,0,6,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Selectivity could arise from enhancement of the cell's response by preferred stimuli, suppression by nonoptimal stimuli, or both. Here, we report that the majority of V1 neurons do not only elevate their activity in response to preferred stimuli, but their firing rates are also suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli. The magnitude of suppression is similar to that of enhancement. There is a tendency for net response suppression to peak at orientations near orthogonal to the optimal for the cell, but cases where suppression peaks at oblique orientations are observed as well. Interestingly, selectivity and suppression correlate in V1: orientation and spatial frequency selectivity are higher for neurons that are suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli than for cells that are not. This finding is consistent with the idea that suppression plays an important role in the generation of sharp cortical selectivity. We show that nonlinear suppression is required to account for the data. However, the precise structure of the neural circuitry generating the suppressive signal remains unresolved.

What is the spatial scale of sleep rhythms? To answer this question, we adapted deep learning algorithms initially developed for detecting earthquakes and gravitational waves in high-noise settings for analysis of neural recordings in sleep. We then studied sleep spindles in non-human primate electrocorticography (ECoG), human electroencephalogram (EEG), and clinical intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings in the human. Within each recording type, we find widespread spindles occur much more frequently than previously reported. We then analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of these large-scale, multi-area spindles and, in the EEG recordings, how spindle patterns change following a visual memory task. Our results reveal a potential role for widespread, multi-area spindles in consolidation of memories in networks widely distributed across primate cortex.","[Mofrad, Maryam H.; Muller, Lyle] Western Univ, Dept Math, London, ON, Canada; [Mofrad, Maryam H.; Gilmore, Greydon; Khan, Ali R.; Suller Marti, Ana; Muller, Lyle] Western Univ, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Gilmore, Greydon; Khan, Ali R.] Western Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, London, ON, Canada; [Koller, Dominik] European Space Agcy, Adv Concepts Team, Noordwijk, Netherlands; [Mirsattari, Seyed M.; Burneo, Jorge G.; Steven, David A.; Suller Marti, Ana] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Clin Neurol Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Mirsattari, Seyed M.] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Med Imaging, London, ON, Canada; [Mirsattari, Seyed M.; Khan, Ali R.] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Med Biophys, London, ON, Canada; [Mirsattari, Seyed M.] Western Univ, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada; [Burneo, Jorge G.; Steven, David A.] Western Univ, Schulich Sch Med & Dent, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, ON, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); European Space Agency; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Muller, L (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Math, London, ON, Canada.;Muller, L (corresponding author), Western Univ, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON, Canada.","lmuller2@uwo.ca","burneo, jorge/B-5767-2015; Khan, Ali/P-1353-2014","burneo, jorge/0000-0002-3644-2826; Hasanzadeh Mofrad, Maryam/0000-0002-0094-6694; Muller, Lyle/0000-0001-5165-9890; Mirsattari, Seyed M/0000-0002-5891-6295; Khan, Ali/0000-0002-0760-8647; Koller, Dominik/0000-0002-7449-9516","Canada First Research Excellence Fund; National Science Foundation [2015276]; Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences; Compute Canada; Kyoto University; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [2015276] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Canada First Research Excellence Fund; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences; Compute Canada; Kyoto University; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Canada First Research Excellence Fund BrainsCAN at Western University Lyle Muller; National Science Foundation NeuroNex Grant No. 2015276 Lyle Muller; Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship Maryam H Mofrad; Compute Canada Resource Allocation Competitions (RAC) Lyle Muller; Kyoto University SPIRITS 2020 Lyle Muller; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,83,1,1,1,6,"eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD","CAMBRIDGE","SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND","2050-084X",,,"ELIFE","eLife","JUN 29",2022,11,,,,,,,,"e75769","10.7554/eLife.75769","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75769"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75769"")",,,24,"Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","2P0SW",35766286,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000819462700001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000819462700001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Based on the known anatomical connectivity of hierarchically organized visual cortical areas and electrophysiological measurements of LFP interactions, a framework for interareal frequency-specific communication has emerged. Our goals were to test the predictions of this framework in the context of the early visual pathways and to understand how attention modulates communication between the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex. We recorded LFPs simultaneously in retinotopically aligned regions of the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex in alert and behaving macaque monkeys trained on a contrast-change detection task requiring covert shifts in visual spatial attention. Coherence and Granger-causal interactions among early visual circuits varied dynamically over different trial periods. Attention significantly enhanced alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency interactions, often in a manner consistent with the known anatomy of early visual circuits. However, attentional modulation of communication among early visual circuits was not consistent with a simple static framework in which distinct frequency bands convey directed inputs. Instead, neuronal network interactions in early visual circuits were flexible and dynamic. perhaps reflecting task-related shifts in attention. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Attention alters the way we perceive the visual world. For example, attention can modulate how visual information is communicated between the thalamus and cortex. We recorded local field potentials simultaneously in the visual thalamus and cortex to quantify the impact of attention on visual information communication. We found that attentional modulation of visual information communication was not static, but dynamic over the time course of trials.","[Mock, Vanessa L.] Dartmouth Coll, Program Expt & Mol Med, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mock, Vanessa L.; Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Luke, Kimberly L.; Hembrook-Short, Jacqueline R.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol Dept, Lebanon, NH USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA","Dartmouth College; University of Rochester; Dartmouth College; University of Rochester; University of Rochester; University of Rochester","Briggs, F (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.","farran_briggs@urmc.rochester.edu",,"Briggs, Farran/0000-0002-4037-4731; Hembrook-Short, Jacqueline/0000-0002-4516-4135","National Eye Institute [EY-018683, EY-013588, EY-025219, EY-023165]; National Science Foundation [EPSCoR 1632738]; Whitehall Foundation; Hitchcock Foundation; Graduate Fellowship from the Albert J.

To investigate if similar mechanisms are controlling function in the primate brain (Macaca fascicularis) after MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, we conducted PET studies of cerebral blood flow, oxygen and glucose metabolism, dopamine transporter, and D2 receptor function. Our observations after MPTP-induced dopamine terminal degeneration of the caudate and putamen revealed increased blood flow (15%) in the globus pallidus (GP), while blood flow was moderately decreased (15-25%) in the caudate, putamen, and thalamus and 40 % in the primary motor cortex (PMC). Oxygen extraction fraction was moderately increased (10-20%) in other brain areas but the thalamus, where no change was observable. Oxygen metabolism was increased in the GP and SMA (supplementary motor area including premotor cortex, Fig. 3) by a range of 20-40% and decreased in the putamen and caudate and in the PMC. Glucose metabolism was decreased in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, and PMC (range 35-50%) and enhanced in the GP by 15%. No change was observed in the SMA. In the parkinsonian primate, [C-11]CFT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyltropane) dopamine transporter binding was significantly decreased in the putamen and caudate (range 60-65%). [C-11]Raclopride binding of dopamine D-2 receptors did not show any significant changes. These experimental results obtained in primate studies of striato-thalamocortico circuitry show a similar trend as hypothetized in Parkinson's disease-type degeneration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the first series of experiments, the virus was injected into the MI forelimb region, and the time-dependent distribution patterns of transsynaptic labeling were analyzed in the frontal lobe with various survivals (2-4 d). Two days after the viral injection, neuronal labeling emerged in the caudal aspects of the nonprimary motor-related areas that are known to project to the MI directly. At the same time, the motor thalamus contained labeled neurons. On the third day, cortical labeling extended into the rostral motor-related areas and, also, prearcuate area 8. Moreover, a number of labeled neurons were located in the internal pallidum and the cerebellar nuclei. At the 4 d postinjection period, neuronal labeling occurred widely in prefrontal areas as well as in the putamen and the cerebellar cortex. In the second series of experiments, the viral injection was made into the MI hindlimb region, and the distribution pattern of prefrontal labeling on the fourth day was compared with that in the forelimb-injection case. The labeled neurons in each prefrontal area were much fewer in the hindlimb-injection case than in the forelimb-injection case. Whereas ventral area 46 was most densely labeled from the forelimb region, only sparse labeling from the hindlimb region was observed in this prefrontal area. The present results suggest the importance of ventral area 46 in the cognitive control of forelimb movements.","Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838526, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; Natl Inst Infect Dis, Tokyo 1628640, Japan; Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Juntendo University; National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID); Nagasaki University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)","Miyachi, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, 2-6 Musashidai, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838526, Japan.","miyachi@tmin.ac.jp",,"Nambu, Atsushi/0000-0003-2153-5445",,,,,60,70,75,0,2,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

A total of 23 subjects participated in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Liquid stimuli were presented at supra-threshold concentrations and delivered by means of a computer controlled gustometer. Left and right sides of the mouth were stimulated separately in order to correlate statistical parametrical maps to both the site of the stimulus and the specific taste quality. Following the effects of the site of stimulation through primary and secondary gustatory cortices an effort was made to explore the laterality of the gustatory pathways. Our results showed for both tastants a predominance of ipsilateral connections at the thalamus level. Insula left and right regions were both involved for both tastants. In these regions we found a high proportion of ipsilateral connection again for both the tastants. Considering orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex, left-sided stimulation with NaCl or MSG produced left-sided activation of the orbito-frontal cortex clearly indicating the presence of an ipsilateral path. Finally, the hypothesis of frontal operculum as primary gustatory cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex as secondary was also supported by the results from dynamic causal modeling.

Here, we present the first validation of eight optogenetic constructs driven by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and a WGA-Cre based dual injection strategy for projection targeting in a widely-used New World primate model, the common squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus. We observed opsin expression around the local injection site and in axonal projections to downstream regions, as well as transduction to thalamic neurons, resembling expression patterns observed in macaques. Optical stimulation drove strong, reliable excitatory responses in local neural populations for two depolarizing opsins in anesthetized monkeys. Finally, we observed continued, healthy opsin expression for at least one year. These data suggest that optogenetic tools can be readily applied in squirrel monkeys, an important first step in enabling precise, targeted manipulation of neural circuits in these highly trainable, cognitively sophisticated animals. In conjunction with similar approaches in macaques and marmosets, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits in squirrel monkeys will provide functional, comparative insights into neural circuits which subserve dextrous motor control as well as other adaptive behaviors across the primate lineage. Additionally, development of these tools in squirrel monkeys, a well-established model system for several human neurological diseases, can aid in identifying novel treatment strategies.","[O'Shea, Daniel J.; Ferenczi, Emily A.; Kaufman, Matthew T.; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [O'Shea, Daniel J.; Kalanithi, Paul; Chandrasekaran, Chandramouli; Diester, Ilka; Ryu, Stephen I.; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kalanithi, Paul] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hsueh, Brian; Goo, Werapong; Diester, Ilka; Ramakrishnan, Charu; Deisseroth, Karl; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Deisseroth, Karl] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yeom, Kristen W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diester, Ilka] Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, Dept Otophysiol, Freiburg, Germany; [Diester, Ilka] Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, BrainLinks BrainTools, Freiburg, Germany; [Kaufman, Matthew T.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA; [Ryu, Stephen I.] Palo Alto Med Fdn, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Deisseroth, Karl; Shenoy, Krishna V.] Stanford Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Stanford University","O'Shea, DJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Neurosci Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;O'Shea, DJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","djoshea@stanford.edu","Chandrasekaran, Chandramouli/H-3442-2019; Kaufman, Matthew/AAK-2860-2020; O'Shea, Daniel J/AAK-6525-2020; Core, Vector/CAF-4832-2022","Chandrasekaran, Chandramouli/0000-0002-1711-590X; Kaufman, Matthew/0000-0002-8072-023X; O'Shea, Daniel/0000-0002-1366-1743; Yeom, Kristen/0000-0001-9860-3368; Diester, Ilka/0000-0001-9362-0986","Michael J.

Areal and laminar origins were characterized as part of a larger study of thalamic input and cortical origins of projections to each area. Cholera toxin beta subunit (CT beta) and cholera toxin beta subunit gold-conjugate (CT beta G) were injected separately within an area or in different areas in an experiment. The areas were identified independently with SMI-32, which revealed differences in neurofilament immunoreactivity in layers III, V, and VI. Each area received convergent AC input from 3 to 6 (mean, 5) contralateral areas. Most of the projections (>75%) were homotopic and from topographically organized loci in the corresponding area. Heterotopic projections (>1 mm beyond the main homotopic projection) constituted approximate to 25% of the input. Layers III and V contained >95% of the commissural neurons. Commissural projection neurons were clustered in all areas. Commissural divergence, assessed by double labeling, was less than 3% in each area. This sparse axonal branching is consistent with the essentially homotopic connectivity of the commissural system. The many heterotopic origins represent unexpected commissural influences converging on an area. Areas more dorsal on the cortical convexity have commissural projections originating in layers III and V; more ventral areas favor layer III at the expense of layer V, to its near-total exclusion in some instances. Some areas have almost entirely layer III origins (temporal cortex and area All), whereas others have a predominantly layer V input (anterior auditory field) or dual contributions from layers III and V (the dorsal auditory zone). A topographic distribution of commissural cells of origin is consistent with the order observed in thalamocortical and corticocortical projections, and which characterizes all extrinsic projection systems (commissural, corticocortical, and thalamocortical) in all AC areas. Thus, laminar as well as areal differences in projection origin distinguish the auditory cortical commissural system.","[Lee, Charles C.; Winer, Jeffery A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Lee, CC (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol, 947 E 58th St,MC0926, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","clee@bsd.uchicago.edu","Lee, Charles/AGY-0285-2022","Lee, Charles/0000-0001-6938-1604","NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC002319, R01 DC2319-29, R01 DC002319-27] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))",,,81,50,51,0,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

These precerebellar nuclei, in turn, receive a feedback projection from the cerebellar nuclei, which mostly originate in the lateral nucleus (LN). It has been suggested that the feedback projection from the LN partially uses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a transmitter. We tested this hypothesis by using a combination of anterograde tracing (biotinylated dextran amine injection into the LN) and postembedding GABA and glutamate immunogold histochemistry. The pattern of labeling in the PN and the NRTP was compared with that of cerebellonuclear terminals in two other target structures, the parvocellular part of the nucleus ruber (RNp) and the ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamus (VM/VL). The projection to the inferior olive (IO), which is known to be predominantly GABAergic, served as a control. A quantitative analysis of the synaptic terminals labeled by the tracer within the PN, the NRTP, and the VL/VM revealed no GABA immunoreactivity. Only one clearly labeled terminal was found in the RNp. In contrast, 72% of the terminals in the IO were clearly GABA immunoreactive, confirming the reliability of our staining protocol. Correspondingly, glutamate immunohistochemistry labeled the majority of the cerebellonuclear terminals in the PN (88%), the NRTP (90%), the RNp (93%), and the VM/VL (63%) but labeled only 5% in the IO. These data do not support a role for GABAergic inhibition either in the feedback systems from the LN to the PN and the NRTP or within the projections to the RNp and the VM/VL.

The next advance was the development of well-tolerated intracerebral stimulation with reversible effects. The quality of the results depends on optimal definition of the stimulation target. Optimally, the surgical protocol includes stereotaxic ventriculography to identify targets followed by electrical activity recordings of the structures crossed by the electrode. Finally, a minute study of the stimulation effects is performed under sterotaxic control while the patient is awake. Parkinson's diseases: Indications for thalamic stimulation in Parkinson's disease have given way to subthalamic stimulation which improves tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity simultaneously. This result confirms the implication of the subthalamic nucleus in the pathogenesis of Parkinson syndromes.

It is highly developed in human and nonhuman primates, but its origin, mode, and dynamics of development, resolution, and eventual extinction are not well understood because human postmortem tissue offers only static descriptive data, and mice cannot serve as an adequate experimental model for the distinct regional differences in primates. Here, we take advantage of the large and slowly developing SP in macaque monkey to examine the origin, settling pattern, and subsequent dispersion of the SP neurons in primates. Monkey embryos exposed to the radioactive DNA replication marker tritiated thymidine ([H-3]dT, or TdR) at early embryonic ages were killed at different intervals postinjection to follow postmitotic cells' positional changes. As expected in primates, most SP neurons generated in the ventricular zone initially migrate radially, together with prospective layer 6 neurons. Surprisingly, mostly during midgestation, SP cells become secondarily displaced and widespread into the expanding SP zone, which becomes particularly wide subjacent to the association cortical areas and underneath the summit of its folia. We found that invasion of monoamine, basal forebrain, thalamocortical, and corticocortical axons is mainly responsible for this region-dependent passive dispersion of the SP cells. Histologic and immunohistochemical comparison with the human SP at corresponding fetal ages indicates that the same developmental events occur in both primate species.","[Duque, Alvaro; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Duque, Alvaro; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Krsnik, Zeljka; Kostovic, Ivica] Univ Zagreb, Sch Med, Croatian Inst Brain Res, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Yale University; Yale University; University of Zagreb","Rakic, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.;Rakic, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.","pasko.rakic@yale.edu","Krsnik, Zeljka/AAI-2999-2020","Krsnik, Zeljka/0000-0001-5238-6820","NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse [R01-DA023999]; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01-NS014841]; NIH/National Eye Institute [R01-EY002593]; Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University; Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost)","NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NIH/National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University; Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost)","This work was supported by grants from the NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01-DA023999), NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01-NS014841), NIH/National Eye Institute (R01-EY002593), and Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University (to P.R.), as well as a Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost) (to I.K.).",,26,72,72,0,6,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424",,,"P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

No other cells of brain tissue exerted KAT-I immunoreactivity during this period. From P3 on, the neurons of the subplate gave rise to KAT-I immunoreactive, varicose axons, which entered the thalamus and terminated around thalamic nerve cells that are devoid of KAT-I immunoreactivity. Other subplate markers displayed a different expression pattern during development. Thus, subplate neurons displayed parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity from E16 to P10 and an intense NPY immunoreaction from P7 to P1. They also exhibited nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity from E16 to P10, whereas on the surface of the subplate neurons, the 0 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was present from P1 to P10. The cells of Cajal-Retzius were nAChR-immunoreactive during this period. Between P1 and P7, the perikarya of subplate neurons also showed an intense immunoreaction with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype R2A. After the first postnatal week, many of the KAT-I positive subplate neurons display a gradual decrease of immunoreactivity and undergo programmed cell death. Since KAT-I persists in the subplate through the period E16-P7, we conclude that KAT-I is a useful and reliable subplate marker in the rat. Since it is assumed that migration of nerve cells is regulated by NMDA receptors, and since kynurenic acid - the only naturally occurring NMDA receptor antagonist - is synthesized by KAT, we suggest that a temporary breakdown of the delicate equilibrium between NMDA and KAT might induce abnormal neuronal migration, giving rise to developmental abnormalities.","Univ Szeged, Dept Neurol, Albert Szent Gyorgyi Med & Pharmaceut Ctr, Szeged, Hungary; Univ Szeged, Dept Anat, Albert Szent Gyorgyi Med & Pharmaceut Ctr, Szeged, Hungary; Wakayama Med Coll, Dept Biochem, Wakayama 640, Japan","Szeged University; Szeged University; Wakayama Medical University","Csillik, AE (corresponding author), Univ Szeged, Dept Neurol, Albert Szent Gyorgyi Med & Pharmaceut Ctr, Semmelweis Utca 6, Szeged, Hungary.","knyihar@nepsy.szote.u-szeged.hu","Vecsei, Laszlo/ABA-6137-2021; Vécsei, László/B-2066-2010","Vécsei, László/0000-0001-8037-3672",,,,,69,30,31,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds).","[Telenczuk, Bartosz; Destexhe, Alain] CNRS, Unite Neurosci Informat & Complexite, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Kempter, Richard] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Curio, Gabriel] Univ Med Charite, Dept Neurol, D-12203 Berlin, Germany","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Humboldt University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin","Telenczuk, B (corresponding author), CNRS, Unite Neurosci Informat & Complexite, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.","telenczuk@unic.cnrs-gif.fr",,"Telenczuk, Bartosz/0000-0002-9884-3537; Curio, Gabriel/0000-0002-3377-7735; Kempter, Richard/0000-0002-5344-2983; Destexhe, Alain/0000-0001-7405-0455","Centre de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France); European Community Future and Emerging Technologies program (Human Brain Project) [FP7-604102, H2020-720270]; Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung [BCCN-B1, 01GQ1001A, 01GQ0972]","Centre de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); European Community Future and Emerging Technologies program (Human Brain Project); Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung","This work was partially funded by the Centre de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France), European Community Future and Emerging Technologies program (Human Brain Project FP7-604102, H2020-720270), and Bundesministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung (Grants BCCN-B1, 01GQ1001A, and 01GQ0972).",,78,4,4,1,1,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,"2373-2822",,"ENEURO","eNeuro","JUL-AUG",2017,4,4,,,,,,,"UNSP e0173-17.2017","10.1523/ENEURO.0173-17.2017","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0173-17.2017"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0173-17.2017"")",,,17,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","FS1DY",28840189,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000419515600013","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000419515600013"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Here, we first review the recent literature on the connectivity and the functions of this structure. It appears that this small lobe, taking up less than 2% of the total cortical surface area, receives afferents from some sensory thalamic nuclei, is (mostly reciprocally) connected with the amygdala and with many limbic and association cortical areas, and is implicated in an astonishingly large number of widely different functions, ranging from pain perception and speech production to the processing of social emotions. Next, we embark on a long, adventurous journey through the voluminous literature on the structural organization of the insular cortex. This journey yielded the following take-home messages: (1) The meticulous, but mostly neglected publications of Rose (1928) and Brockhaus (1940) are still invaluable for our understanding of the architecture of the mammalian insular cortex. (2) The relation of the insular cortex to the adjacent claustrum is neither ontogenetical nor functional, but purely topographical. (3) The insular cortex has passed through a spectacular progressive differentiation during hominoid evolution, but the assumption of Craig (2009) that the human anterior insula has no homologue in the rhesus monkey is untenable. (4) The concept of Mesulam and Mufson (1985), that the primate insula is essentially composed of three concentrically arranged zones, agranular, dysgranular, and granular, is presumably correct, but there is at present much confusion concerning the more detailed architecture of the anterior insular cortex. (5) The large spindle-shaped cells in the fifth layer of the insular cortex, currently known as von Economo neurons (VENs), are not only confined to large-brained mammals, such as whales, elephants, apes, and humans, but also occur in monkeys and prosimians, as well as in the pygmy hippopotamus, the Atlantic walrus, and Florida manatee. Finally, we point out that the human insula presents a unique opportunity for performing an in-depth comparative analysis of the relations between structure and function in a typical sensory and a typical cognitive cortical domain.","Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN-KNAW)","Nieuwenhuys, R (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.","RudolfN@planet.nl",,,,,,,118,379,386,8,173,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"978-0-44-453867-3; 978-0-44-453860-4","PROG BRAIN RES","Prog.

To test this hypothesis in the macaque monkey, we used a subtype-specific antibody to the m2 muscarinic receptor. Immunoreactive cells were well visualized in the nucleus basalis, where some of these cells displayed dense m2 immunoreactivity, while others were lightly labeled. This heterogeneity of labeling intensity was not based on peculiarities of the methodology, because cholinergic cells of the striatum expressed uniformly dense m2 immunoreactivity. Concurrent labeling with choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity proved that most of the heavily m2-labeled cells in the nucleus basalis were also choline acetyltransferase positive. The Endings demonstrate that at least 10-25% of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of the monkey are densely m2 immunoreactive. In the striatum, concurrent labeling demonstrated that the majority, if not all, choline acetyltransferase-positive cells also contained m2 immunoreactivity. In addition, these experiments identified a population of smaller striatal cells which were m2 immunoreactive and choline acetyltransferase negative. Consecutive labeling with m2 immunoreactivity and NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry demonstrated that many of these m2-immunoreactive non-cholinergic neurons belonged to the population of nitric oxide-synthesizing medium aspiny neurons. The findings indicate that the m2 muscarinic receptor may be expressed at high levels in only a subset of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. In contrast, m2 receptors appear to be expressed by all cholinergic cells of the striatum. (C) 1999 IBRO.

A fundamental issue concerns the roles that thalamocortical input and intracortical connectivity play in generating the activities. Here we addressed this issue in guinea pigs using in vivo and in vitro real-time optical imaging techniques. As reported previously, tone-evoked activity propagated dorsoventrally along a strip (an IS) in AI. We found that an electrical pulse applied focally within the strip, triggered activity propagation with a spatiotemporal pattern highly similar to tone-evoked activation. The propagation velocity of electrically evoked activity was significantly slower than that of tone-evoked activity, but was comparable to the velocity of lateral activity propagation in cortical slices, suggesting that the electrically evoked activity propagation in vivo is mediated by intracortical circuits. To test this notion, we lesioned the auditory thalamus chemically; in such animals, electrically evoked activity in AI was not affected, although tone-evoked activity was abolished. Further, in slices of the AI, the extent of electrically evoked activity propagation in layer II/III was significantly larger in coronal slices than in horizontal slices. Together, our results suggest that intracortical connectivity in AI enables a focally evoked activity to propagate throughout an IS.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; Hitachi Ltd, Adv Res Lab, Saitama 3500395, Japan","Osaka University; Hitachi Limited","Song, WJ (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.","song@ele.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp",,"Nishimura, Masataka/0000-0002-3309-458X; Song, Wen-Jie/0000-0003-2909-3098",,,,,45,50,50,0,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Previous experiments have indicated that the periodicity of these columns can be influenced by visual experience: compared to normally raised animals both strabismic cats and cats raised with alternating monocular exposure displayed an increased spacing of adjacent ocular dominance columns in the primary visual cortex (area 17). However, recently it was shown that the formation of ocular dominance columns begins much earlier than previously supposed, indicating that early visual experience might only have a limited influence on the development of the spatial pattern of ocular dominance columns. We therefore visualized the complete pattern of ocular dominance columns in area 17 of normally raised and strabismic kittens during early postnatal development (age 3-6 weeks), particularly focussing on littermates. In addition, we used a previously developed spatial analysis (period statistics) to quantify columnar spacing two-dimensionally. We observed a pronounced interindividual variability in both normally raised and strabismic animals, with column spacings ranging from 783 to 1362 mum. In contrast to previous reports, there were no significant differences in columnar periodicity between normally raised and strabismic cats. These data indicate that rearing has less influence on column spacing while the interindividual variability is much greater than previously supposed, suggesting that genetic differences have an influence on column spacing.","Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Forschergrp Visuelle Entwicklung & Plast, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Hirnforsch, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany","Leibniz Institut fur Neurobiologie (LIN); Max Planck Society","Lowel, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Forschergrp Visuelle Entwicklung & Plast, Brenneckestr 6, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany.","loewel@ifn-magdeburg.de",,,,,,,46,9,11,0,2,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

The projection of cells in the cervical spinal cord of monkeys to the cuneate nucleus has been reported to avoid pars rotunda of that nucleus, the part that contains the somatotopic representation of the ipsilateral hand. We used the sensitive anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin to reexamine this projection. We made multiple iontophoretic injections into the cervical enlargements of three monkeys (two Macaca fascicularis and one Macaca mulatta). Control injections were made in the contralateral dorsal columns of one of these and in the dorsal roots of a fourth animal (M. fascicularis) to test for transport by fibers of passage. After 28-39 days, the animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused, and the tissue was processed for immunohistochemical detection of the label. In all cases (excluding control injections), labeled fibers and varicosities were distributed widely in the ipsilateral cuneate and external cuneate nuclei, including pars rotunda. The dorsal column nuclei ipsilateral to control injections contained no label or only very few poorly labeled fibers, indicating that labeling through fibers of passage did not contribute importantly to the results. This study indicates that the postsynaptic projection to the cuneate nucleus is widespread and includes pars rotunda. Such projections may contribute to transmission of information originating in nociceptors through the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system to the ventrobasal thalamus.

Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to trace the development of a laminar cytoarchitecture and an adult pattern of axonal neurofilament expression. From the 16th fetal week to the 4th postnatal month, the cortex progresses from a marginal layer and an undifferentiated cortical plate to incipient lamination. Between the 22nd fetal week and the 4th postnatal month, a two-tiered band of neurofilament-immunoreactive axons develops in layer I, but subsequent to the 4th month, the number of immunopositive axons in this layer is greatly reduced. Between the middle of the first year of life and age 3 years, the laminar pattern of cytoarchitecture becomes fully mature and a network of immunostained axons develops in layers VI, V, IV, and IIIc. This axonal plexus in the deep cortical layers continues to increase in density until age 5. Beginning at 5 years of age, a network of neurofilament-positive axons develops in the superficial layers IIIb, IIIa, and II, and by 11-12 years of age, overall axonal density is equivalent to that seen in young adulthood. This extended time span of axonal maturation has implications for the emergence of auditory cortical function.","House Ear Res Inst, Dept Neuroanat, Los Angeles, CA 90057 USA","House Research Institute","Moore, JK (corresponding author), House Ear Res Inst, Dept Neuroanat, 2100 W 3rd St,5th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90057 USA.","jmoore@hei.org",,,,,,,84,191,197,0,5,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1525-3961","1438-7573",,"JARO-J ASSOC RES OTO","JARO","DEC",2001,2,4,,,,,297,311,,"10.1007/s101620010052","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101620010052"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101620010052"")",,,15,"Neurosciences; Otorhinolaryngology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Otorhinolaryngology","506QB",11833605,"Green Published, Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000172982300001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000172982300001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Left and right IFCop are implicated in developmental stuttering. Weak left IFCop connections and divergent connectivity of hyperactive right IFCop regions have been related to impeded speech. Here, we reanalyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 83 children (41 stuttering). We generated connection probability maps of functionally segregated area 44 parcels and calculated hemisphere-wise analyses of variance. Children who stutter showed reduced connectivity of executive, rostral-motor, and caudal-motor corticostriatal projections from the left IFCop. We discuss this finding in the context of tracing studies from the macaque area 44, which leads to the need to reconsider current models of speech motor control. Unlike the left, the right IFCop revealed increased connectivity of the inferior posterior ventral parcel and decreased connectivity of the posterior dorsal parcel with the anterior insula, particularly in stuttering boys. This divergent connectivity pattern in young children adds to the debate on potential core deficits in stuttering and challenges the theory that right hemisphere differences might exclusively indicate compensatory changes that evolve from lifelong exposure. Instead, early right prefrontal connectivity differences may reflect additional brain signatures of aberrant cognition-emotion-action influencing speech motor control.","[Neef, Nicole E.] Univ Med Ctr Gottingen, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Neuroradiol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Angstadt, Mike; Chang, Soo-Eun] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, 4250 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Koenraads, Simone P.

Anatomical investigations in animals and post-mortem humans have established that cerebro-cerebellar connections are contralateral to each other and include the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) and cortico-ponto-cerebellar (CPC) pathways. CTC and CPC characterization in humans in vivo is still challenging. Here advanced tractography was combined with quantitative indices to compare CPC to CTC pathways in healthy subjects. Differently to previous studies, our findings reveal that cerebellar cognitive areas are reached by the largest proportion of the reconstructed CPC, supporting the hypothesis that a CTC-CPC loop provides a substrate for cerebro-cerebellar communication during cognitive processing. Amongst the cerebral areas identified using in vivo tractography, in addition to the cerebral motor cortex, major portions of CPC streamlines leave the prefrontal and temporal cortices. These findings are useful since provide MRI-based indications of possible subtending connectivity and, if confirmed, they are going to be a milestone for instructing computational models of brain function. These results, together with further multi-modal investigations, are warranted to provide important cues on how the cerebro-cerebellar loops operate and on how pathologies involving cerebro-cerebellar connectivity are generated.","[Palesi, Fulvia] Univ Pavia, Dept Phys, Pavia, PV, Italy; [Palesi, Fulvia; De Rinaldis, Andrea; Castellazzi, Gloria; D'Angelo, Egidio] C Mondino Natl Neurol Inst, Brain Connect Ctr, Pavia, PV, Italy; [De Rinaldis, Andrea; Castellazzi, Gloria; Magenes, Giovanni] Univ Pavia, Dept Elect Comp & Biomed Engn, Pavia, PV, Italy; [Calamante, Fernando] Melbourne Brain Ctr, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [Calamante, Fernando] Univ Melbourne, Florey Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [Muhlert, Nils; Chard, Declan; Wheeler-Kingshott, Claudia A.

The animals were trained on two reaching tasks and one tactile texture discrimination task. Task 1 simply involved reaching toward and grasping a reward from one of five well positions. Task 2 required the monkey to use both hands simultaneously to obtain a reward. The tactile texture discrimination task required the monkey to signal the roughness of a passively delivered texture using its jaw. After lesions to area 5, the monkeys showed a decrease in hand use for tasks 1 and 2 and an inability to perform task 2 in specific locations in visual space. These deficits recovered within several days. No deficits were observed in the tactile texture discrimination task or in an analgesic control monkey. Electrophysiological recordings made just before the lesion, immediately after the lesion, and 2 months after the lesion demonstrated that cortical areas just rostral to the lesioned area 5, and areas 1 and 2, were topographically reorganized and that receptive fields for neurons in these fields changed location on the body surface. These cortical map changes are correlative and may, in part, contribute to the rapid behavioral recovery observed. The mechanism for such rapid changes may be the unmasking of existing divergent and convergent thalamocortical connections that are part of the normal cortical circuitry.","[Padberg, Jeffrey; Recanzone, Gregg; Engle, James; Cooke, Dylan; Goldring, Adam; Krubitzer, Leah] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Padberg, Jeffrey] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Engle, James; Goldring, Adam; Krubitzer, Leah] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Recanzone, Gregg] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Central Arkansas; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis","Krubitzer, L (corresponding author), Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","lakrubitzer@ucdavis.edu","Cooke, Dylan F./O-9954-2019","Cooke, Dylan F./0000-0002-5976-705X; Goldring, Adam/0000-0003-0082-9532","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01-NS35103]; National Eye Institute (NEI) [R01-EY013458, F32-EY014503-01A1]","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Eye Institute (NEI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))","This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant R01-NS35103 (to L.K.), National Eye Institute (NEI) Grant R01-EY013458 (to G.

However, it is unclear when and how the cerebellar outputs contribute to M1 activity. To address this question, we examined the response of M1 neurons to electrical stimulation of the DN and M1 activity during performance of arm-reaching tasks. Based on response patterns to DN stimulation, M1 neurons were classified into facilitation-, suppression-, and no-response-types. During tasks, not only facilitation- and suppression-type M1 neurons, but also no response-type M1 neurons increased or decreased their firing rates in relation to arm reaching movements. However, the firing rates of facilitation- and suppression-type neurons were higher than those of no-response-type neurons during both inter-trial intervals and arm reaching movements. These results imply that cerebellar outputs contribute to both spontaneous and movement-related activity in the M1, which help to maintain muscle tones and execute coordinated movements, although other inputs also contribute to movement-related activity.

Here we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that project via the thalamus to supplementary eye field (SEF) of the frontal cortex of macaques. After rabies injections into the SEF, many neurons in the restricted region, the ventral aspects of the dentate nucleus (DN), the caudal pole of the DN, and the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of DN and PIN neurons labeled from the motor cortex. In the basal ganglia, a large number of labeled neurons were confined to the dorsomedial portion of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) as more neurons were labeled in the inner portion of the GPi (GPii) than in the outer portion of the GPi (GPio). This is the first evidence of a projection between cerebellum/basal ganglia and the SEF that could enable the cerebellum to modulate the cognitive control of voluntary eye movement.","[Lu, Xiaofeng] Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Lu, Xiaofeng] Vet Adm Med Ctr, Brain Sci Ctr, One Vet Dr,Bldg 49,Rm 240, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA; [Lu, Xiaofeng; Ohmae, Shogo; Uchida, Yusuke] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurophysiol, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Ohmae, Shogo] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Uchida, Yusuke] Meijo Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, Tempaku Ku, 1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Nagoya, Aichi 4688502, Japan","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System; Juntendo University; Kyoto University; Baylor College of Medicine; Meijo University","Lu, XF (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.;Lu, XF (corresponding author), Vet Adm Med Ctr, Brain Sci Ctr, One Vet Dr,Bldg 49,Rm 240, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA.;Lu, XF (corresponding author), Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurophysiol, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.","luxxx049@umn.edu","; Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015","Ohmae, Shogo/0000-0003-1726-4961; Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [18500247, 20500293]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20500293, 18500247] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by Scientific Research (18500247 and 20500293) to X.L. from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.",,85,2,2,0,2,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1473-4222","1473-4230",,"CEREBELLUM","Cerebellum","JUN",2020,19,3,,,,,401,408,,"10.1007/s12311-020-01108-8","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01108-8"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12311-020-01108-8"")",,"FEB 2020",8,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","LK4NE",32076936,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000516366600002","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000516366600002"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

[C-11]-Mecamylamine was prepared and evaluated as a putative radioligand for positron emission tomography to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The radiosynthesis consisted in the [C-11]-methylation of the desmethyl precursor within 40 min with 30-40% radiochemical yield decay corrected. Biodistribution studies in rats showed that radioligand crossed the blood-brain barrier (0.39% ID at 30 min) and only unmetabolized tracer was recovered from brain at 45 min. Ex vivo autoradiography studies in rats did not indicate preferential uptake, and pre-treatment mecamylamine or with chlorisondamine, an nicotinic receptor inhibitor, did not demonstrate a significant specific binding. To investigate possible specie differences and effects of anesthesia, in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out on anaesthetized baboons and conscious macaques. The regional brain distribution of [C-11]-mecamylamine in the two species of primates exhibited similar kinetics as did the rat with steady state reached about 45-50 min after radiotracer administration. Uptake values were two-fold higher in brain of conscious macaque than in anaesthetized baboon (thalamus: 0.258% ID/(kg mL) in conscious macaques and 0.129% ID/(kg mL) in baboons). PET images showed a radioactivity distribution which was quite homogeneous throughout the brain but with somewhat higher uptake in grey matter than in white. Brain distribution was unaltered by saturation or displacement studies. Possible explanation for the failure to establish specific binding in vivo could be long-lived structural modifications of the ionotropic channel by the unlabeled ligand administered before the tracer. In conclusion, [C-11]-mecamylamine did not satisfy the requirements for a PET tracer of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Some response features, including all spatial receptive field characteristics and bursting behavior, are entirely normal in beta2-/- dLGN cells. In other respects, the responses of beta2-/- dLGN cells are quantitatively abnormal: the mutation is associated with higher spontaneous and visually evoked firing rates, faster visual response latencies, a preference for higher temporal frequencies, and a trend toward greater contrast sensitivity. The normal response properties in the beta2-/- dLGN show that none of the many effects of the mutation, including disrupted geniculate functional organization and abnormal cholinergic transmission, have any effect on spatial response characteristics and bursting behavior in dLGN neurons. The abnormal response characteristics in the beta2-/- dLGN are most interesting in that they are no worse than normal; any visual processing deficits found in studies of the beta2-/- visual cortex must therefore arise solely from abnormalities in cortical processing.","Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England","University of Oxford","Thompson, ID (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PT, England.","ian.thompson@physiol.ox.ac.uk","Thompson, Ian D/C-5785-2009; Grubb, Matthew S/B-4939-2008","Grubb, Matthew S/0000-0002-2673-274X","Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,44,16,20,0,0,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Although developmental mechanisms that govern the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex have been characterized in rodents(6-9), the mechanisms that underlie the development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity and the lateral expansion of the PFC with a distinct granular layer 4 in primates(10,11) remain unknown. Here we report an anterior (frontal) to posterior (temporal), PFC-enriched gradient of retinoic acid, a signalling molecule that regulates neural development and function(12-15), and we identify genes that are regulated by retinoic acid in the neocortex of humans and macaques at the early and middle stages of fetal development. We observed several potential sources of retinoic acid, including the expression and cortical expansion of retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzymes specifically in primates as compared to mice. Furthermore, retinoic acid signalling is largely confined to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a retinoic-acid-catabolizing enzyme, which is upregulated in the prospective motor cortex. Genetic deletions in mice revealed that retinoic acid signalling through the retinoic acid receptors RXRG and RARB, as well as CYP26B1-dependent catabolism, are involved in proper molecular patterning of prefrontal and motor areas, development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity, intra-PFC dendritic spinogenesis and expression of the layer 4 marker RORB. Together, these findings show that retinoic acid signalling has a critical role in the development of the PFC and, potentially, in its evolutionary expansion.","[Shibata, Mikihito; Pattabiraman, Kartik; Lorente-Galdos, Belen; Andrijevic, David; Kim, Suel-Kee; Kaur, Navjot; Muchnik, Sydney K.; Xing, Xiaojun; Santpere, Gabriel; Sousa, Andre M.

To overcome these issues, we propose two new dimensionality reduction methods that use minimum and maximum information models. These methods are information theoretic extensions of STC that can be used with non-Gaussian stimulus distributions to find relevant linear subspaces of arbitrary dimensionality. We compare these new methods to the conventional methods in two ways: with biologically-inspired simulated neurons responding to natural images and with recordings from macaque retinal and thalamic cells responding to naturalistic time-varying stimuli. With non-Gaussian stimuli, the minimum and maximum information methods significantly outperform STC in all cases, whereas MID performs best in the regime of low dimensional feature spaces.","[Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Rowekamp, Ryan J.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Rowekamp, Ryan J.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Rowekamp, Ryan J.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sincich, Lawrence C.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Vis Sci, Birmingham, AL USA","Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Salk Institute; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham","Fitzgerald, JD (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","sharpee@salk.edu","Sharpee, Tatyana O/E-8663-2010","Sharpee, Tatyana/0000-0002-7483-5081","NIH [EY019493]; NSF [IIS-0712852, PHY-0822283]; Searle Funds; Alfred P.

The following components of the somatosensory evoked potentials were simultaneously recorded from 21-27 epidural electrodes: P7 (the letter indicates positive or negative polarity; the number indicates the approximate latency of the peak in ms) was recorded widely from various locations on both the left and right hemispheres, P10 was recorded near the anterior side of the central sulcus contralateral to the stimulation side, N10 was recorded near the posterior side of the contralateral central sulcus, P12 was recorded on both sides of the contralateral central sulcus, and P18 was recorded posterior to the contralateral central sulcus. Current source generators (dipoles) of each component of somatosensory evoked potentials were localized by dipole tracing: a dipole for P7 was located in the thalamus contralateral to the stimulation side; a dipole for P10 and N10 in the posterior wall of the contralateral central sulcus (area 3b); a dipole for P12 in the contralateral post central gyrus (areas 1 and 2); and a dipole for P18 in the anterior wall of the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (area 5). The locations and latencies of dipoles that generated cortical components of somatosensory evoked potentials, estimated by dipole tracing, were confirmed by direct cortical surface recording from a 16-25 electrode array placed directly on the cortical surface; and multiple unit recording from the anterior and posterior parietal cortices. After excision of area 5, P18 and N18 were abolished, whereas P10, N10, and P12 were not affected. The results suggest that dipoles for somatosensory evoked potentials progressed from the thalamus to area 5 via the primary somatosensory area. This progress is consistent with the hierarchical sequence of somatosensory information processing.","TOYAMA MED & PHARMACEUT UNIV,FAC MED,DEPT NEUROSURG,TOYAMA 93001,JAPAN","University of Toyama","HAYASHI, N (corresponding author), TOYAMA MED & PHARMACEUT UNIV,FAC MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,TOYAMA 93001,JAPAN.",,,,,,,,40,30,30,0,0,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB","0306-4522",,,"NEUROSCIENCE","Neuroscience","SEP",1995,68,2,,,,,323,338,,"10.1016/0306-4522(95)00126-4","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00126-4"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00126-4"")",,,16,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","RL983",7477944,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1995RL98300005","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1995RL98300005"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Here we found neural correlates of confidence in the primate pulvinar, a visual thalamic nucleus that has been expanding markedly through evolution. During a categorization task, the majority of pulvinar responses did not correlate with any 'perceptual content'. During an opt-out task, pulvinar responses decreased when monkeys chose 'escape' options, suggesting less confidence in their perceptual categorization. Functional silencing of the pulvinar increased monkeys' escape choices in the opt-out task without affecting categorization performance; this effect was specific to the contralateral visual target. These data were supported by a theoretical model of confidence, indicating that pulvinar activities encode a subject's certainty of visual categorization and contribute to perceptual confidence.","[Komura, Yutaka; Nikkuni, Akihiko; Hirashima, Noriko; Uetake, Teppei; Miyamoto, Aki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Technol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Komura, Yutaka] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol, Saitama, Japan","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)","Komura, Y (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Technol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.","komura-y@aist.go.jp",,,"Japan Science and Technology Agency; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21683008, 24120525] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Science and Technology Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank K.

As the original Papez circuit failed to explain functional imaging findings, a more detailed investigation is needed to delineate connections among the circuit's key hubs. Here we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) from eight normal subjects and used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to elucidate connections among hubs in the retrosplenial gyrus, hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Our results show that the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) was visualized in all eight individual DSI datasets, as well as in the DSI and HCP group datasets, but a strictly defined VHC was only visualized in one individual dataset. Thalamic fibers were observed to connect with both the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The RSC was mainly responsible for direct hippocampal connections, while the PCC was not. This indicates that the RSC and PCC represent separate functional hubs in humans, as also shown by previous primate axonal tracing studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations.

We previously found a substantial 25% reduction in neuron number of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17, BA17) in postmortem tissue from subjects with schizophrenia. Also, many studies have found reduced volume and neuron number of the pulvinar-the large thalamic association nucleus involved in higher-order visual processing. Here, we investigate if the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the visual relay nucleus of the thalamus, has structural changes in schizophrenia. We used stereological methods based on unbiased principles of sampling (Cavalieri's principle and the optical fractionator) to estimate the total volume and neuron number of the magno- and parovocellular parts of the left LGN in postmortem brains from nine subjects with schizophrenia, seven matched normal comparison subjects and 13 subjects with mood disorders. No significant schizophrenia-related structural differences in volume or neuron number of the left LGN or its major subregions were found, but we did observe a significantly increased total volume of the LGN, and of the parvocellular lamina and interlaminar regions, in the mood group. These findings do not support the hypothesis that subjects with schizophrenia have structural changes in the LGN. Therefore, our previous observation of a schizophrenia-related reduction of the primary visual cortex is probably not secondary to a reduction in the LGN.","[Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Psychiat Res, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark; [Zhang, Wei; Sampson, Allan R.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Lewis, David A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Caric, Damira] Allegheny Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15212 USA; [Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton; Caric, Damira; Saghafi, Ramin; Lewis, David A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Aarhus University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Allegheny General Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Dorph-Petersen, KA (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Psychiat Res, Skovagervej 2, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark.","Karl-Anton@Dorph-Petersen.dk","Lewis, David A/G-4053-2014; Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton/A-9039-2015","Lewis, David A/0000-0002-3225-6778; Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton/0000-0002-6676-034X","National Institute of Mental Health [MH43784, MH45156]","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","The project described was supported by Grants Numbers MH43784 and MH45156 from the National Institute of Mental Health.

We studied the structural, topographic, neurochemical and intrinsic connectional features of IM neurons in the rhesus monkey brain. We found that the intercalated neurons are not confined to discrete cell clusters, but form a neuronal net that is interposed between the basal nuclei and extends to the dorsally located anterior, central, and medial nuclei of the amygdala. Unlike the IM in rodents, which are prominent in the anterior half of the amygdala, the primate inhibitory net stretched throughout the antero-posterior axis of the amygdala, and was most prominent in the central and posterior extent of the amygdala. There were two morphologic types of intercalated neurons: spiny and aspiny. Spiny neurons were the most abundant; their somata were small or medium size, round or elongated, and their dendritic trees were round or bipolar, depending on location. The aspiny neurons were on average slightly larger and had varicose dendrites with no spines. There were three nonoverlapping neurochemical populations of IM neurons, in descending order of abundance: (1) Spiny neurons that were positive for the striatal associated dopamine-and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+); (2) Aspiny neurons that expressed the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB+); and (3) Aspiny neurons that expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS+). The unique combinations of structural and neurochemical features of the three classes of IM neurons suggest different physiological properties and function. The three types of IM neurons were intermingled and likely interconnected in distinct ways, and were innervated by intrinsic neurons within the amygdala, or by external sources, in pathways that underlie fear conditioning and anxiety.

The cerebellum has interconnections with brainstem and thalamic reticular systems that subserve arousal. Autonomic activity is supported by the reciprocal interconnections with the hypothalamus. Limbic and paralimbic connections include the hypothalamus, septal region, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Associative connections consist of both feedforward and feedback limbs. The basilar pons receives inputs from the prefrontal, posterior parietal, superior temporal, parahippocampal, and cingulate cortices, as well as from the sensorimotor cortices. This information is conveyed from the pons to cerebellum, before it is relayed back via thalamus to the associative and paralimbic regions of the cerebral cortex. The anatomical arrangement of segregated loops of cerebral cortical connections stands in contrast to the cerebellar cortical architecture that is essentially uniform. This has theoretical and clinical ramifications. It is the anatomical basis for the dysmetria of thought hypothesis that postulates a universal cerebellar transform, in which the cerebellum performs its unique computation in a topographically precise manner on diverse streams of information relating to almost all aspects of behavior including cognition and emotion. It provides an anatomic basis for the observations of cerebellar activation by cognitive and affective paradigms in functional neuroimaging experiments. It helps explain the clinical phenomena that characterize the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome, and it provides an anatomic basis for a causal relationship between cerebellar pathology and psychiatric and neurobehavioral conditions. Knowledge of these anatomical pathways is critical to the further development of hypotheses, experimental approaches, and clinical questions that can advance the understanding of the contribution of the cerebellum to cognition and to disorders of intellect and emotion.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Schmahmann, JD (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Burnham 823,Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",,"Schmahmann, Jeremy/ABF-1215-2021","Schmahmann, Jeremy/0000-0003-0706-5125",,,,,156,90,95,0,18,"CARFAX PUBLISHING","BASINGSTOKE","RANKINE RD, BASINGSTOKE RG24 8PR, HANTS, ENGLAND","0954-0261",,,"INT REV PSYCHIATR","Int.

Their responses to various visual stimuli and to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were characterized. In retrograde double-labelling experiments, the pretectal projections to the LP-P and to the LGN were tested for possible overlap. Forty-five neurons were antidromically activated from the LP-P; 55 % of them could also be activated orthodromically from the optic chiasm. Most antidromically activated neurons responded to rapid movements of large textured visual stimuli as well as to 'on' or 'off' visual stimulation with short bursts. When stimulated with a slowly moving, large, structured visual stimulus, most cells showed a slight but significant activity increase. None of the neurons projecting to the LP-P was also activated antidromically from the LGN. Thus, the two populations are separate. This is supported by the results from the retrograde double-labelling experiments. None of the LP-P projecting neurons showed any directional selectivity to slow movements of large visual stimuli, a property by which pretectal neurons projecting to the inferior olive are characterized. Thus, neurons projecting to the LP-P do not bifurcate to the inferior olive. Response properties of neurons projecting to the LP-P were very similar to those of the 'jerk' neurons described by Schweigart and Hoffmann (Exp.

We present a modular neural network model of these areas that encodes the serial order of events into spatial patterns of PF activity. The model is based on the topographically specific circuits linking the PF with the basal ganglia. Each module traces a pathway from the PF, through the basal ganglia and thalamus, and back to the PF. The complete model consists of an array of modules interacting through recurrent corticostriatal projections and collateral inhibition between striatal spiny units. The model's architecture positions spiny units for the classification of cortical contexts and events and provides bistable cortical-thalamic loops for sustaining a representation of these contextual events in working memory activations. The model was tested with a simulated version of a delayed-sequencing task. In single-unit studies, the task begins with the presentation of a sequence of target lights. After a short delay, the monkey must touch the targets in the order in which they were presented. When instantiated with randomly distributed corticostriatal weights, the model produces different patterns of PF activation in response to different target sequences. These patterns represent an unambiguous and spatially distributed encoding of the sequence. Parameter studies of these random networks were used to compare the computational consequences of collateral and feed-forward inhibition within the striatum. In addition, we studied the receptive fields of 20,640 model units and uncovered an interesting set of cue-, rank- and sequence-related responses that qualitatively resemble responses reported in single unit studies of the PF. The majority of units respond to more than one sequence of stimuli. A method for analyzing serial receptive fields is presented and utilized for comparing the model units to single-unit data.","Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Northwestern University","Houk, JC (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, M211,Ward Bldg 5-315,303 E Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",,,"Beiser, David/0000-0001-9676-087X","NIMH NIH HHS [P50-MH-48185] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,105,186,187,0,8,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

They were then examined using the electron microscope for their synaptic contacts, both the afferent contacts onto their dendrites and their presynaptic dendritic contacts onto presumptive projection (relay) neuron dendrites. The somata of these interneurons were small (mean = 178 mu m(2)), but the dendritic trees were large compared with those of projection neurons. All three interneurons had similar synaptic patterns onto their dendrites with about equal numbers of retinal, cortical, and GABAergic contacts. The distribution of these contacts was more uniform compared with the same types of contacts made onto projection neurons. The presynaptic dendrites were observed to contact only the dendrites of presumptive projection neurons, and these contacts were nearly all in the form of geniculate triads. None of the three interneurons displayed an axon. The receptive fields of these interneurons were similar to those of projection cells, but were larger and had center-response signs that were the opposite of the projection neurons around them (e.g. OFF center for the dorsal part of the parvocellular mass where ON-center projection neurons reside). The squirrel monkey data provides additional evidence that one aspect of the laminar pattern observed in the parvocellular pathway of the primate's dLGN might be related to a segregation of projection neurons of one center-response sign with interneurons of the opposite center-response sign.","EMORY UNIV, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, ATLANTA, GA 30322 USA; EMORY UNIV, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, ATLANTA, GA 30322 USA","Emory University; Emory University","Wilson, JR (corresponding author), EMORY UNIV, YERKES REG PRIMATE RES CTR, ATLANTA, GA 30322 USA.",,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR00165] Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [EY04976] Funding Source: Medline","NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,57,8,8,0,0,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0952-5238","1469-8714",,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","NOV-DEC",1996,13,6,,,,,1129,1142,,"10.1017/S095252380000777X","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095252380000777X"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095252380000777X"")",,,14,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","VQ369",8961542,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1996VQ36900013","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1996VQ36900013"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

However, little anatomical data are available in human about the functional networks these cingulate areas underlie. Therefore, networks anchored in the rostral and caudal cingulate motor areas (rCMA and cCMA, respectively) were studied in human using functional connectivity during the brain resting state. Since the rCMA and cCMA are located just under the pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA and SMA), the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks were also studied to ensure that these four circuits were correctly dissociated. Data from 14 right-handed healthy volunteers were acquired at rest and analyzed by region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations of separate ROIs located in rCMA, cCMA, pre-SMA, and SMA were successively used to identify significant temporal correlations with BOLD signal fluctuations of other brain regions. Low-frequency BOLD signal of the CMA was correlated with signal fluctuations in the prefrontal, cingulate, insular, premotor, motor, medial and inferior parietal cortices, putamen and thalamus, and anticorrelated with the default-mode network. rCMA was more in relation with prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and language-associated cortices than cCMA more related to sensory cortex. These cingulate networks were very similar to the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks, although pre-SMA and SMA showed stronger correlation with the prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and with the cerebellum and the superior parietal cortex, respectively. The human cingulate motor areas constitute an interface between sensorimotor, limbic and executive systems, sharing common cortical, striatal, and thalamic relays with the overlying premotor medial areas.","Univ Paris 06, Serv NeuroImagerie, CHNO Quinze Vingts, F-75012 Paris, France","4EU+; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; CHNO des Quinze-Vingts","Habas, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, Serv NeuroImagerie, CHNO Quinze Vingts, 28,Rue Charenton, F-75012 Paris, France.","chabas@quinze-vingts.fr",,,,,,,34,37,38,0,5,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0028-3940",,,"NEURORADIOLOGY","Neuroradiology","JAN",2010,52,1,,,,,47,59,,"10.1007/s00234-009-0572-1","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00234-009-0572-1"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00234-009-0572-1"")",,,13,"Clinical Neurology; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","537FE",19629462,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000273097700005","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000273097700005"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In humans, the organization and layout of core and belt auditory fields are still poorly understood, and most auditory neuroimaging studies rely on macroanatomical criteria, rather than functional localization of distinct fields. A myeloarchitectonic method has been suggested recently for distinguishing between core and belt fields in humans (Dick F, Tierney AT, Lutti A, Josephs O, Sereno MI, Weiskopf N. 2012. In vivo functional and myeloarchitectonic mapping of human primary auditory areas. J Neurosci. 32:16095-16105). We propose a marker for core AC based directly on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and pattern classification. We show that a portion of AC in Heschl's gyrus classifies sound frequency more accurately than other regions in AC. Using fMRI data from macaques, we validate that the region where frequency classification performance is significantly above chance overlaps core auditory fields, predominantly A1. Within this region, we measure tonotopic gradients and estimate the locations of the human homologues of the core auditory subfields A1 and R. Our results provide a functional rather than anatomical localizer for core AC. We posit that inter-individual variability in the layout of core AC might explain disagreements between results from previous neuroimaging and cytological studies.","[Schoenwiesner, Marc] Lab Brain Mus & Sound Res BRAMS, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Schoenwiesner, Marc] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Schoenwiesner, Marc] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dechent, Peter] Univ Med Gottingen, MR Res Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Cognit Neurol, Gottingen, Germany; [Voit, Dirk] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Biomed NMR Res GmbH, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Petkov, Christopher I.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Sch Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Krumbholz, Katrin] MRC, Inst Hearing Res, Nottingham, England","Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; McGill University; University of Gottingen; Max Planck Society; Newcastle University - UK","Schonwiesner, M (corresponding author), Lab Brain Mus & Sound Res BRAMS, Pavil 1420 Mt Royal, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.","marc.schoenwiesner@umontreal.ca","Petkov, Christopher I/O-5318-2015","Petkov, Christopher I/0000-0002-4932-7907; Schonwiesner, Marc/0000-0002-2023-1207; Krumbholz, Katrin/0000-0001-8297-2628","Discipline Bridging Award of the University of Nottingham, UK; German Academy of Sciences; Volkswagen Foundation; Medical Research Council (UK); Wellcome Trust (UK); BBSRC [BB/J009849/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_U135097128] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U135097128] Funding Source: researchfish","Discipline Bridging Award of the University of Nottingham, UK; German Academy of Sciences; Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); Medical Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust (UK)(Wellcome Trust); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This work was supported by the Discipline Bridging Award of the University of Nottingham, UK.

Recent findings in the monkey and in humans have led to a parallel and interconnected network. Nevertheless, little is known about these networks. Here, we present two cases of patients with a parietal low-grade glioma. They underwent surgery under local anesthesia with cortical and subcortical mapping. For patient 1, subcortical electrostimulation immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced movement disorders, with an inhibition of leg and arm movements medially and, more laterally, an acceleration of arm movement. For patient 2, electrostimulation of white matter immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced an inhibition of both arm movement. It means that the detected fibers in the parietal lobe may be involved in the motor control modulation. They are distributed veil-like immediately posterior to thalamocortical pathways and could correspond to a fronto-parietal movement control subnetwork. These two cases highlight the major role of the subcortical connectivity in movement regulation, involving parietal lobe, thus the necessity to be identified and preserved during brain surgery.","[Almairac, Fabien] Hop Louis Pasteur, Dept Neurosurg, Univ Hosp Nice, F-06000 Nice, France; [Herbet, Guillaume; Duffau, Hugues] Univ Montpellier, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Hop Gui de Chauliac, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Moritz-Gasser, Sylvie] Univ Montpellier, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Hop Gui de Chauliac, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Herbet, Guillaume; Moritz-Gasser, Sylvie; Duffau, Hugues] Univ Montpellier, Team Plast Cent Nervous Syst Human Stem Cells & G, INSERM U1051, Inst Neurosci Montpellier,Med Ctr, F-34059 Montpellier, France","CHU Nice; Universite de Montpellier; CHU de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; CHU de Montpellier; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Montpellier","Almairac, F (corresponding author), Hop Louis Pasteur, Dept Neurosurg, Univ Hosp Nice, Pavillon G,Ave Voie Romaine, F-06000 Nice, France.","fabien.almairac@gmail.com","Herbet, Guillaume/AAA-2204-2021","Herbet, Guillaume/0000-0001-6690-254X; Moritz-Gasser, Sylvie/0000-0001-6386-9617",,,,,17,21,21,0,2,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0344-5607","1437-2320",,"NEUROSURG REV","Neurosurg.

Areas S2, PV, and 3b were mapped after long-term unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns at cervical levels in adult macaque monkeys. In areas S2 and PV, we found neurons responding to touch on the face in regions in which responses to touch on the hand and other body parts are normally seen. In the reorganized parts of S2 and PV, inputs from the chin as well as other parts of the face were observed, whereas in area 3b only the chin inputs expand into the deafferented regions.

Although the V1 projection forms only a small minority of synapses in V5, its affect could be considerably amplified by local circuits in V5, in a way analogous to the amplification of the small thalamic input to area V1.","Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Iowa Hosp & Clin, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","University of Iowa","Anderson, JC (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, ETH Zurich, Winterthurerstr 150, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785","NIMH NIH HHS [MH 53598] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,63,74,74,0,2,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Pharmacological studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the plasticity of the visual cortex just as they are involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), another activity-dependent form of plasticity. The setting up of synaptic connectivity in the neocortex may rely on LTP-like mechanisms. By using immunohistochemistry techniques, we tested the hypothesis of the role of subunit R1 of NMDA (NMDAR1) receptors in the thalamocortical afferent segregation into ocular-dominance columns in the New World monkey, Callithrix jacchus. We employed early and short (2 weeks) monocular-deprivation periods at different ages of postnatal development(17, 46, 67, 107, and 188 postnatal days). We observed heterogeneous distribution of NMDAR1 in the layer IVC receiving the thalamic inputs if the deprivation was realized between the ages of 46 and 107 days. Layers IVC alpha and IVC beta were involved differently as a function of the deprivation age. The striped pattern lost its differential intensity with the postnatal age. These results are compared with the ocular-dominance pattern evolution described in other works on this primate. They provide evidence of the NMDAR1 role in the modular organization, within time limits, during the postnatal development of the primary visual cortex.

It is characterized by the presence of retinal afferents and peptidergic cells projecting via a geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT) to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), site of the mammalian circadian clock. The adult IGL also contains abundant reactive astrocytes immunoreactive to GFAP. Because glia have a large role in brain development, we examined the ontogeny of the hamster IGL with respect to both glial and neuronal markers. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-IR) cells destined for the IGL appear on embryonic day 11 (E11) in a matrix of vimentin (VIM)-IR radial glia. Migratory ellipsoid NPY-IR cells with long leading and trailing processes become oriented between the reticular thalamic neuroepithelial lobule, and the developing IGL. Most NPY-IR cells arrive in the IGL by E14 and extend axons ventrally into the GHT. These penetrate the SCN at P3 and arborize to an adult-like stage by pin. A specialized GFAP-IR radial glial path coinciding with the migratory route of NPY-IR cells appears by E14. As early as E15, cells contributing to this path are found displaced away from the ventricle. As the glial path disappears from the maturing brain, the entire length of the IGL becomes filled with GFAP-IR astrocytes. These features are consistent with translocation and transformation of a specialized set of radial glia into IGL astrocytes. The results demonstrate that the IGL is a large, developmentally important, feature of the lateral geniculate complex that is embryologically distinct from adjacent dorsal and ventrolateral geniculate nuclei.","SUNY STONY BROOK,HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT PSYCHIAT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook",,,"Morin, Lawrence P/B-7487-2009","Morin, Lawrence/0000-0002-6580-6545","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS022168-14, NS22168, R01 NS022168] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,45,30,30,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

We investigated whether this sparing was due to compensation by undamaged orbital frontal cortex (O), an area also critical for DNMS, by comparing combined IC and O damage (Neo-ICO) with damage to O alone (Neo-O). Group Neo-ICO was impaired on DNMS learning at 3 months and 2 years of age. In contrast, Group Neo-O was impaired at 3 months, but recovered this function by 2 years, compared with Neo-IC and controls (N). We propose that the intact IC assumed the function of learning the DNMS rule for Group Neo-O. The persistent impairment after Neo-ICO lesions suggests that whereas O may likely support the rule acquisition in the absence of IC, no compensatory mechanisms are available after the combined damage. For the memory of lists of items, all groups were impaired at 3 months. At 2 years, the performance of Groups N and Neo-IC dramatically improved, whereas that of groups with O damage (Neo-O and Neo-ICO) remained impaired, indicating a critical role for O in recognition memory that cannot be substituted by another area.","[Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Washington, DC USA; [Alvarado, Maria C.; Bachevalier, Jocelyne] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Georgetown University; Emory University","Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Washington, DC 20007 USA.","malkoval@georgetown.edu; jbachev@emory.edu","Alvarado, Maria C./AAG-1751-2021","Alvarado, Maria C./0000-0001-8858-6373","National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program at National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Mental Health at National Institutes of Health [MH58848]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at National Institutes of Health [HD35471, KO2 HD42269]","National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program at National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Mental Health at National Institutes of Health; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at National Institutes of Health","This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program, the National Institute of Mental Health (MH58848 to J.B.) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HD35471 to J.B. and KO2 HD42269 to L.M.), all at the National Institutes of Health.",,50,4,4,0,6,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Using fMRI we performed a neck muscle vibration paradigm in humans in order to detect brain areas involved in processing changes of the head position in relation to the rest of the body. We identified a network of primary and secondary cortical areas: (I) regions that presumably receive direct proprioceptive thalamic input such as areas 3a, 2, S2 and the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), (II) foci in the intraparietal sulcus, motor and premotor areas, and the frontal eye field (FEF). Activation of the former reflect early stages of proprioceptive processing, nevertheless these areas contain polysensory subdivisions such as area 3aNv, which also receives vestibular afferents. Together with area PIVC and the vestibular field in area 2 (2v), area 3aNv constitutes the inner vestibular circuit, an interconnected cortical triangle of polysensory areas that project to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which is known to be involved in polysensory integration. With respect to possible analogies in the monkey, we speculate that the activation we observed in the PPC is closely related to the LIP and VIP regions of the macaque. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TorsinA immunoreactivity was visualized using a monoclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein encoding exon 4 of human torsinA. Western blot analysis of brain homogenates revealed a major species of about 39 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of glycosylated torsinA protein. By light microscopy, torsinA like-immunoreactivity was enriched in gray matter in all brain regions examined. Immunoreactivity was concentrated in the neuropil and immunopositive cell bodies were not observed. Structures particularly enriched in torsinA like-immunoreactivity included the cerebral cortex, the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, the hippocampal formation, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and molecular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Cell bodies of pigmented dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. pars compacta were immunonegative. Biochemical fractionation of the human striata revealed a concentration of torsinA immunoreactivity in particulate fractions. Ultrastructural studies of the human and Macaque striata further revealed an association of torsinA immunostaining with small vesicles within axons and presynaptic terminals forming symmetric synapses. These ultrastructural studies are consistent with a pre-synaptic localization of torsinA protein in the adult striatum and are consistent with a role of torsinA in modulating striatal signaling, although the widespread localization of the protein suggests it probably also participates in signaling in other regions.

Although recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of rodents, particularly mice, to investigate PPC and related networks, a coherent anatomical definition of PPC in the mouse is still lacking. To address this, we delineated the mouse PPC, using cyto-and chemoarchitectural markers from Nissl-, parvalbumin-and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2-staining. Additionally, we performed bilateral triple anterograde tracer injections in primary visual cortex (V1) and prepared flattened tangential sections from one hemisphere and coronal sections from the other, allowing us to co-register the cytoarchitectural features of PPC with V1 projections. This revealed that extrastriate area A was largely contained within lateral PPC, that medial PPC overlapped with the anterior portion of area AM, and that anterior RL overlapped partially with area PtP. Furthermore, triple anterograde tracer injections in PPC showed strong projections to associative thalamic nuclei as well as higher visual areas, orbitofrontal, cingulate and secondary motor cortices. Retrograde circuit mapping with rabies virus further showed that all cortical connections were reciprocal. These combined approaches provide a coherent definition of mouse PPC that incorporates laminar architecture, extrastriate projections, thalamic, and cortico-cortical connections.","[Hovde, Karoline; Gianatti, Michele; Witter, Menno P.; Whitlock, Jonathan R.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Trondheim, Norway; [Gianatti, Michele] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Oslo","Hovde, K; Whitlock, JR (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Trondheim, Norway.","karoline.hovde@ntnu.no; whitlock@ntnu.no",,"Whitlock, Jonathan/0000-0003-2642-8737","Norges Forskningsrad [223262, 197467, 239963]; FP7 Ideas: European Research Council [335328]; European Research Council (ERC) [335328] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Norges Forskningsrad; FP7 Ideas: European Research Council; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","Norges Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: Centre for Neural Computation, grant No. 223262, NORBRAIN, grant No. 197467 and Young Research Talents, grant No. 239963; FP7 Ideas: European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Starting Grant, No. 335328",,65,28,29,1,10,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Via this pathway information from sensory, motor and associative areas of the cerebral cortex are routed to a variety of thalamocortical and brainstem networks involved in the organization of motor behaviour. In a previous analysis of the rat substantia nigra pars reticulata we have shown that the nigral cells which project to thalamus, tectum and tegmentum are topographically ordered along a series of curved laminae. Extending these observations, the present study examined how striatal regions related to particular areas of the cerebral cortex innervate the lamellar keyboard of nigral output neurons. For this purpose, small microiontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were performed in the striatum and the distribution of retrogradely-labelled cells in the cerebral cortex and anterogradely-labelled axons in the substantia nigra were conjointly examined. The results indicate that with the exception of the striatal region related to the allocortex, all the various components of the striatal functional mosaic art represented in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. This representation is organized under the form of longitudinal bands which compose a series of curved laminae enveloping a core located dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra. The striatal mapping in substantia nigra pars reticulata is such that the projections of the auditory and visual compartments are confined to the most ventral lamina. More dorsally, an ordered representation of the body is achieved by the nigral lamination. The oral and perioral body parts are centred on the dorsolateral core and the more distal parts of the face and limbs are progressively set out in more peripheral laminae. In the region affiliated to the prefrontal cortex, the dorsal cingulate district innervate a ventromedial lamina, the prelimbic:insular district lie dorsal to it. Projections from lateral orbital and insular compartments extend laterally along the dorsal margin of the pars reticulata. Since the ''onion-like'' distribution of striatal inputs is precisely the form observed in the distribution of nigral efferent neurons, the present observations favour the view that the nigral lamination underlies formation of specific input-output channels of processing. Evidence is considered that these channels are specialized for particular classes of movements or behaviours and integrate the various information relevant to the completion of these movements or behaviours.

Although these maturational changes in synaptic density have been observed across the cortical mantle, little is known about the precise time course of developmental refinements in synaptic inputs to specific populations of cortical neurons. We examined the postnatal development of two markers of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a subpopulation of layer III pyramidal neurons in areas 9 and 46 of rhesus monkey prefrontal cortex. These neurons are of particular interest because they play a major role in the flow ofinformation both within and between cortical regions. Quantitative reconstructions of Golgi-impregnated mid-layer III pyramidal neurons revealed substantial developmental changes in the relative density of dendritic spines, the major site of excitatory inputs to these neurons. Relative spine density;on both the apical and basilar dendritic trees increased by 50% during the first two postnatal months, remained at a plateau through 1.5 years of age, and then decreased over the peripubertal age range until stable adult levels were achieved. As a measure of the postnatal changes in inhibitory input to the axon initial segment of these pyramidal neurons, we determined the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive axon terminals belonging to the chandelier class of local circuit neurons. The density of these distinctive axon terminals (cartridges) exhibited a temporal pattern of change that exactly paralleled the changes in dendritic spine density. These results suggest that subpopulations of cortical neurons may be regulated by dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs during development and, in concert with other data, they emphasize the cellular specificity of postnatal refinements in cortical circuitry.","UNIV PITTSBURGH, DEPT PSYCHIAT, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, DEPT NEUROSCI, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA; UNIV LONDON, INST OPHTHALMOL, DEPT VISUAL SCI, LONDON EC1V 9EL, ENGLAND; UNIV PARIS 11, NEUROBIOL & NEUROPHARMACOL LAB, ORSAY, FRANCE","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of London; University College London; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay",,,"Lewis, David A/G-4053-2014","Lewis, David A/0000-0002-3225-6778","NIMH NIH HHS [MH45156, MH00519] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,65,192,196,0,6,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4522","1873-7544",,"NEUROSCIENCE","Neuroscience","JUL",1995,67,1,,,,,7,22,,"10.1016/0306-4522(95)00051-J","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00051-J"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00051-J"")",,,16,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","RC355",7477911,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1995RC35500002","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1995RC35500002"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Cortex 1:1-47). Some anatomical evidence, such as differences in the laminar distribution of the neurons of origin and of the terminations of their axons, has supported this division. However, very little is actually known about the distribution and morphology of the neurons of the feedback projections. In order to contribute further to our understanding of these two components of the corticocortical projections, I studied the distribution and morphology of a feedback projection, the reciprocal projection from the posterior medial lateral suprasylvian sulcus (PMLS), to primary visual cortex (area 17). Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent tracers in vivo combined with intracellular dye injections in lightly fixed cortical slices revealed many similarities between the feedforward and feedback projections: 1) They both emanate from all layers but layer 1; 2) each layer of origin contains a wide variety of standard and/or inverted pyramidal neurons; and 3) all of these, with the exception of a rare, large layer 5 neuron, have dendritic fields restricted principally to their layers of origin. There was, however, one major difference between the feedforward and feedback projections: In contrast to the projection from area 17 to PMLS, the projection from PMLS had a dense projection from layer 6 that comprised a striking abundance of spiny fusiform and inverted pyramidal neurons. These were morphologically distinct from other layer 6 neurons that project to the thalamus. Taken together, these data suggest that the reciprocal projections between area 17 and area PMLS, although not completely equivalent, share essential features that form a distinct population of neurons differing in morphology from corticothalamic projection neurons.

Recent experimental reports have analyzed neurotransmitter signaling before the onset of synaptogenesis, which could act to influence early developmental events such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation of animal brain development. Such signaling may also occur in human development. The expression of molecules involved in neurotransmission in precocious human brain may reflect either the differentiation of a permanent neurotransmitter system of the adult brain or transient expression to serve specific developmental functions different from those in the adult brain. We review the changes observed in the expression of various catecholamine markers such as tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in various neuronal populations of the developing human telencephalon. The specific transporter for serotonin, serotonin transporter (SERT) has been detected in fibers of the internal capsule (IC) during the restricted time period of 12-14 gestational weeks in humans. These serotonin-containing fibers do not correspond to serotoninergic ascending axons from the raphe nuclei. They may be the human counterpart of the thalamo-cortical axons that have been shown to uptake serotonin during the critical period of development of the sensory systems in rodents. GABA phenotypes are expressed in numerous cells of the human ganglionic eminence (GE) and cerebral wall at the end of the embryonic period proper. These results are similar to that described at comparable developmental stages in the mouse and support the hypothesis of an early migration from ganglionic progenitors in humans. But one cannot exclude a transient expression of GABA within the post-mitotic neurons, which could influence early developmental events. In conclusion, data showing the phenotypic expression of molecules in discrete areas of the brain at various points in the protracted human development require careful interpretation.

These effects seemed to be derived from the supplementary motor area (SMA). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) was used to check this hypothesis. Brain activations were contrasted in Time production and (control) Force production tasks involving left-hand responding. These tasks, presented in mixed order, were designed to be of equivalent difficulty and involve comparable levels of attention. Several brain areas were activated in both tasks relative to baseline: the SMA, the putamen, and the lateral cerebellum. Contrasts between tasks gave clear-cut differences. Activations specific to the Time task were found in the SMA proper and the left primary motor cortex. The Force task activated the right sensorimotor cortex and the left cerebellum, and, bilaterally, the infero-parietal cortex and the insula. The main result, i.e. prominent activation of the SMA proper in relation to temporal production, corroborates our previous studies based on slow cortical potentials.

Here we report that these events correspond to momentary drops in cortical arousal and are associated with activity changes in the basal forebrain and thalamus. Combining fMRI and electrophysiology in macaques, we first establish that fMRI transients co-occur with spectral shifts in local field potentials (LFPs) toward low frequencies. Applying this knowledge to fMRI data from the human connectome project, we find that the fMRI transients are strongest in sensory cortices. Surprisingly, the positive cortical transients occur together with negative transients in focal subcortical areas known to be involved with arousal regulation, most notably the basal forebrain. This subcortical involvement, combined with the prototypical pattern of LFP spectral shifts, suggests that commonly observed widespread variations in fMRI cortical activity are associated with momentary drops in arousal.","[Liu, Xiao; de Zwart, Jacco A.; Chang, Catie; Duyn, Jeff H.] NINDS, Adv MRI Sect, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Liu, Xiao] Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Multimodal & Computat Neuroimaging Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Xiao] Penn State Univ, Inst CyberSci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schoelvinck, Marieke L.] Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NINDS, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Max Planck Society; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)","Liu, X (corresponding author), NINDS, Adv MRI Sect, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Liu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Multimodal & Computat Neuroimaging Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Liu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Inst CyberSci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","xxl213@engr.psu.edu","Duyn, Jozef H/F-2483-2010; Liu, Xiao/C-5943-2016","de Zwart, Jacco/0000-0001-8155-8185; Liu, Xiao/0000-0002-8459-3135; Scholvinck, Marieke/0000-0001-5750-825X","NIH Intramural Research [ZIA MH002896, ZIC MH002899]; NIH [(K99/R00) 4R00NS092996-02]","NIH Intramural Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This research was supported (in part) by the NIH Intramural Research (ZIA MH002896, ZIC MH002899), and the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) 4R00NS092996-02.

In contrast, lesions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule in combination with damage to lateral thalamus compromised motor outcome. In experimental tracing of the topography of the internal capsule in macaque monkeys, we found axons of primary motor cortex passing through the middle third of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Axons of premotor cortex (dorsolateral and post-arcuate area 6) passed through the capsular genu, and those of supplementary motor area (mesial area 6) through the anterior limb. Small capsular lesion can therefore disrupt the output of functionally and anatomically distinct motor areas selectively. The clinically similar motor deficits with a similar course of functional restitution following disruption of these different descending motor pathways indicate a parallel operation of cortical motor areas.

The prefrontal cerebral cortex is thought to be critical to the performance of such behaviors, although the relative contribution of different components of this structure and associated subcortical regions are not fully understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during a simple task which required repeated reversals of a rule linking a colored cue and a left/right motor response. Each trial comprised three discrete events separated by variable delay periods. A colored cue instructed which response was to be executed; followed by a go signal which told the subject to execute the response and a feedback instruction which indicated whether to hold or flip the rule linking the colored cue and response. The design allowed us to determine which brain regions were recruited by the specific demands of preparing a rule contingent motor response, executing such a response, evaluating the significance of the feedback, and reconfiguring stimulus-response (SR) associations. The results indicate that an increase in neural activity occurs within the anterior cingulate gyrus under conditions in which SR associations are labile. In contrast, lateral frontal regions are activated by unlikely/unexpected perceptual events regardless of their significance for behavior. A network of subcortical structures, including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and striatum were the only regions showing activity that was exclusively correlated with the neurocognitive demands of reversing SR associations. We conclude that lateral frontal regions act to evaluate the behavioral significance of perceptual events, whereas medial frontal-thalamic circuits are involved in monitoring and reconfiguring SR associations when necessary.","Univ Exeter, Sch Psychol, Exeter Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Exeter, Devon, England","University of Exeter","Hodgson, TL (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Psychol, Exeter Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Exeter, Devon, England.","t.l.hodgson@ex.ac.uk","Parris, B.

The temporal relationship between the occupancy level of central mAChRs and cognitive impairment was determined. Three conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were subjected to positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11](+)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre-, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h post-intramuscular administration of scopolamine in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg. Occupancy levels of mAChR were maximal 2 h post-scopolamine in cortical regions innervated primarily by the basal forebrain, thalamus, and brainstem, showing that mAChR occupancy levels were 43-59 and 65-89% in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, dose-dependent impairment of working memory performance was measured 2 h after scopolamine. A positive correlation between the mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment 2 and 6 h post-scopolamine was the greatest in the brainstem (P < 0.00001). Although cognitive impairment was not observed 24 h post-scopolamine, sustained mAChR occupancy (11-24%) was found with both doses in the basal forebrain and thalamus, but not in the brainstem. These results indicate that a significant degree of mAChRs occupancy is needed to produce cognitive impairment by scopolamine. Furthermore, the importance of the brainstem cholinergic system in working memory in monkey is described.

These interactions occur via cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. The putamen is one of the major sites of cortical input into basal ganglia loops and is frequently activated during pain. This activity has been typically associated with the processing of pain-related motor responses. However, the potential contribution of putamen to the processing of sensory aspects of pain remains poorly characterized. In order to more directly determine if the putamen can contribute to sensory aspects of pain, nine individuals with lesions involving the putamen underwent both psychophysical and functional imaging assessment of perceived pain and pain-related brain activation. These individuals exhibited intact tactile thresholds, but reduced heat pain sensitivity and widespread reductions in pain-related cortical activity in comparison with 14 age-matched healthy subjects. Using magnetic resonance imaging to assess structural connectivity in healthy subjects, we show that portions of the putamen activated during pain are connected not only with cortical regions involved in sensory-motor processing, but also regions involved in attention, memory and affect. Such a framework may allow cognitive information to flow from these brain areas to the putamen where it may be used to influence how nociceptive information is processed. Taken together, these findings indicate that the putamen and the basal ganglia may contribute importantly to the shaping of an individual subjective sensory experience by utilizing internal cognitive information to influence activity of large areas of the cerebral cortex.","[Starr, Christopher J.; Oshiro, Yoshitetsu; Quevedo, Alexandre S.; McHaffie, John G.; Coghill, Robert C.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Sawaki, Lumy; Wittenberg, George F.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Wittenberg, George F.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore VA Med Ctr, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr GRECC, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Wittenberg, George F.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Burdette, Jonathan H.] Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Geriatric Research Education & Clinical Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Baltimore VA Medical Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Wake Forest University","Coghill, RC (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.","rcoghill@wfubmc.edu","Wittenberg, George/AAM-3428-2020; Wittenberg, George F/J-8698-2015","Wittenberg, George/0000-0001-5603-1197; Quevedo, Alexandre/0000-0001-5613-8015","National Institutes of Health [R01 NS 39426]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This study is supported and funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01 NS 39426).",,97,100,102,0,13,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","JUL",2011,134,,7,,,,1987,2004,,"10.1093/brain/awr117","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr117"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr117"")",,,18,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","782YV",21616963,"Bronze, Green Published",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000292049600014","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000292049600014"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Pulvinar neurons have been shown to integrate the component signals of a plaid pattern into a coherent global percept (pattern-motion selectivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have investigated the possibility that the human pulvinar is also involved in plaid-defined higher-order motion integration. Plaid patterns were presented to normal observers in two conditions (coherent vs. transparent) created by varying the relative spatial frequency of the two gratings comprising the plaid. Regions of interest analysis revealed a significant activation of the pulvinar in the coherent condition supporting the notion that the human pulvinar nucleus is involved in higher-order motion processing. Plaid pattern activation was also observed in the media temporal gyrus (area MT/V5), a motion area with strong anatomical connections to the pulvinar. These data provide the first direct evidence that the human pulvinar is involved in complex motion integration, as previously shown in animal models, and further support the existence of cortico-thalamo-cortical computational networks involved in higher-order visual processing.

Previously, we have shown that the nonradioactive (R,R)-diastereomer displays an eightfold selectivity for M1 over M2 while the nonradioactive (R,S)-diastereomer displays a sevenfold selectivity for M2 over M1 in vitro. This paper reports the results of in vivo comparison studies. In the rat, uptake of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB was nearly uniform in all brain regions following the concentration of M2 subtype. The uptake was reduced by 36-54% in all brain regions on coinjection with 50 nmol of unlabeled ligand. An injection of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB followed at 60 min by injection of unlabeled ligand and subsequent sacrifice at 120 min displaced 30-50% of radioactivity in the pens, medulla, and cerebellum, which contain a high proportion of M2 subtype. The most dramatic displacement and inhibition of uptake on coinjection of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB was observed in the heart. In rhesus monkey, the compound showed prolonged uptake and retention in the brain. In the blood, the parent compound degraded rapidly to a single radiolabeled polar metabolite believed to be fluoride. Within 30 min the parent compound represented less than 5% of the plasma activity. Displacement with (R)-QNB was generally slow, but was more rapid from those tissues which contain a higher proportion of M2 subtype. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB is M2 selective in vivo. On the other hand, (R,R)-[F-18]-FMeQNB showed higher uptake in those brain regions containing a higher concentration of M1 subtype. Uptake in the heart at 60 min was much lower than that observed with the (R,S)-diastereomer. Inhibition of uptake on coinjection with unlabeled (R,S)-FMeQNB is only significant in the heart, thalamus, and pens. Inhibition of uptake on coinjection with unlabeled (R,R)-FMeQNB is quite uniform in all brain regions. Displacement with (R)-QNB shows a more varying amount displaced. These results are consistent with (R,R)-[F-18]-FMeQNB being M1 selective in vivo.

Here we used binocular flash suppression to investigate whether visual awareness is also explicitly reflected in feature-selective neural activity of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a cortical area reciprocally connected to the temporal lobe. We show that neuronal discharges in the majority of single units and recording sites in the LPFC follow the phenomenal perception of a preferred stimulus. Furthermore, visual awareness is reliably reflected in the power modulation of high-frequency (>50 Hz) local field potentials in sites where spiking activity is found to be perceptually modulated.

Although numerous changes have been reported in local functional studies, few studies have reported on the anatomical network of the entire brain. Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey. Then, the drifts in centrality from normal to PD networks were described in terms of complex network analysis and summarized with principal component analysis. Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns.

The high affinity, K-D = 30 pM, makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing both striatal and extrastriatal binding in the brain. In this work, dynamic PET studies of two macaque monkeys were acquired along with arterial plasma samples. Compartmental analysis and Logan plots were used to analyze the striatum, thalamus, frontal, and temporal cortices and to validate a reference region of analysis which yields a distribution volume ratio (DVR). The cerebellum was used as the reference region. The results indicate that all methods of analysis are in close agreement over all the analyzed regions in the brain. The average DVRs for the two monkeys was found to be: caudate = 26, putamen = 29, thalamus = 3.8, frontal ctx = 1.7, and temporal ctx = 1.7 on a high-resolution PET scanner. It was found that a scan time of 2 h is needed to accurately estimate the DVR for all regions of the brain. The striatal regions require the longest to linearize and are the most sensitive to variations in time average tissue-to-plasma efflux constant, (k) over bar(2). For the extrastriatal regions, the effect of the (k) over bar(2) term on DVR calculation is negligible. Repeatability measurements for all regions were found to be within 10% using the DVR parameter.

We hypothesize that these waves are the predominant physiological process reflected in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal fluctuations. The correlation structure (functional connectivity) of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques. These findings suggest that traveling waves spatiotemporally pattern brain-wide excitability in relation to arousal.","[Raut, Ryan, V; Snyder, Abraham Z.; Raichle, Marcus E.] Washington Univ, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Snyder, Abraham Z.; Raichle, Marcus E.] Washington Univ, Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mitra, Anish] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yellin, Dov; Malach, Rafael] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Fujii, Naotaka] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Adapt Intelligence, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Stanford University; Weizmann Institute of Science; RIKEN","Raut, RV (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Radiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","raut@wustl.edu","Raut, Ryan/AAB-6821-2021","Raut, Ryan/0000-0002-8761-1431; Raichle, Marcus/0000-0002-1847-9588; Mitra, Anish/0000-0002-3362-2274; Malach, Rafi/0000-0002-2869-680X; Yellin, Dov/0000-0002-7520-8581; Snyder, Abraham/0000-0002-3379-9627","NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research [1U54MH091657]; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; NIH [NS080675]; NSF [DGE-1745038]","NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","HCP data were provided by the HCP WU-Minn Consortium (principal investigators: D.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans have shown that the caudal ventrolateral midbrain, encompassing the ventrolateral PAG, has activations during migraine attacks. The PAG may well be involved not only through the descending modulation of nociceptive afferent information, but also by its ascending projections to the pain processing centres of the thalamus. In this study the intranuclear oncogene protein Fos was used to mark cell activation in the PAG following stimulation of the trigeminally-innervated superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in both cats and in nonhuman primates (Macaca nemestrina). Fos expression in the PAG increased following stimulation to a median of 242 cells (interquartile range 236-272) in the cat and 155 cells (range 104-203) in the monkey, compared with control levels of 35 cells (21-50) and 26 cells (18-33), respectively.

Some studies have suggested that functional and structural impairments in the default mode network may play a role in explaining these disorders. In contrast, others have proposed that dysfunctions in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit involving striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus may be the main underlying mechanism. Here, we provide the first report of structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting the nodes of the mesocircuit and the default mode network in 8 patients with DOC. We found evidence of significant damage to subcortico-cortical and cortico-cortical fibers, which were more severe in vegetative state patients and correlated with clinical severity as determined by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. In contrast, fiber tracts interconnecting subcortical nodes were not significantly impaired. Lastly, we found significant damage in all fiber tracts connecting the precuneus with cortical and subcortical areas. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the default mode network and most importantly the precuneus - and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the neural basis of the DOC.

Cerebral in-vivo mapping of glucose metabolism has been studied in severe stable parkinsonian monkeys, but data on brain metabolic changes in early stages of dopaminergic depletion of this model is lacking. Here, we report cerebral metabolic changes associated with progressive nigrostriatal lesion in the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of the progressive 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkey model of Parkinson's Disease. Monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) received MPTP injections biweekly to induce progressive grades of dopamine depletion. Monkeys were sorted according to motor scale assessments in control, asymptomatic, recovered, mild, and severe parkinsonian groups. Dopaminergic depletion in the striatum and cerebral metabolic patterns across groups were studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using monoaminergic ([C-11]-dihydrotetrabenazine; C-11-DTBZ) and metabolic (2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose; F-18-FDG) radiotracers. C-11-DTBZ-PET analysis showed progressive decrease of binding potential values in the striatum of monkeys throughout MPTP administration and the development of parkinsonian signs. F-18-FDG analysis in asymptomatic and recovered animals showed significant hypometabolism in temporal and parietal areas of the cerebral cortex in association with moderate dopaminergic nigrostriatal depletion. Cortical hypometabolism extended to involve a larger area in mild parkinsonian monkeys, which also exhibited hypermetabolism in the globus pallidum pars interna and cerebellum. In severe parkinsonian monkeys, cortical hypometabolism extended further to lateral-frontal cortices and hypermetabolism also ensued in the thalamus and cerebellum. Unbiased histological quantification of neurons in Brodmann's area 7 in the parietal cortex did not reveal neuron loss in parkinsonian monkeys versus controls. Early dopaminergic nigrostriatal depletion is associated with cortical, mainly temporo-parietal hypometabolism unrelated to neuron loss. These findings, together with recent evidence from Parkinson's Disease patients, suggest that early cortical hypometabolism may be associated and driven by subcortical changes that need to be evaluated appropriately. Altogether, these findings could be relevant when potential disease modifying therapies become available.","[Molinet-Dronda, Francisco; Blesa, Javier; Juri, Carlos; Trigo-Damas, Ines; Iglesias, Elena; Hernandez, Ledia F.; Gago, Belen; Rodriguez-Oroz, Maria C.; Obeso, Jose A.] Univ Navarra, Movement Disorders Lab, Neurosci Area, CIMA, Pamplona, Spain; [Molinet-Dronda, Francisco; Collantes, Maria; Ecay, Margarita; Penuelas, Ivan] Clin Univ Navarra, IdiSNA, Translat Mol Imaging Unit UNIMTRA, Pamplona, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Lopez-Gonzalez del Rey, Natalia; Pineda-Pardo, Jose A.; Trigo-Damas, Ines; Hernandez, Ledia F.; Rodriguez-Rojas, Rafael; Obeso, Jose A.] Ctr Networked Biomed Res Neurodegenerat Dis CIBER, Madrid, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Lopez-Gonzalez del Rey, Natalia; Pineda-Pardo, Jose A.; Trigo-Damas, Ines; Hernandez, Ledia F.; Rodriguez-Rojas, Rafael; Obeso, Jose A.] Hosp Univ HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hosp, HM CINAC Ctr Integral Neurociencias Abarca Campal, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Gonzalez del Rey, Natalia; Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel A.; Cavada, Carmen] Autonoma Madrid Univ, PhD Program Neurosci, Cajal Inst, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Juri, Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Santiago, Chile; [Collantes, Maria; Ecay, Margarita; Prieto, Elena; Penuelas, Ivan] Clin Univ Navarra, Dept Nucl Med, Pamplona, Spain; [Gago, Belen] Univ Malaga, Fac Med, Inst Invest Biomed Malaga, Malaga, Spain; [Prieto, Elena] Clin Univ Navarra, Med Phys, Pamplona, Spain; [Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel A.; Cavada, Carmen] Autonoma Madrid Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurosci, Madrid, Spain","University of Navarra; University of Navarra; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Cajal (IC); Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University of Navarra; Universidad de Malaga; University of Navarra","Obeso, JA (corresponding author), Hosp HM Puerta del Sur, HM CINAC, Madrid, Spain.","jobeso.hmcinac@hmhospitales.com","Blesa, Javier/M-3473-2014; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023; Juri, Carlos/B-6213-2008; Collantes, María/A-4641-2015; Prieto, Elena/N-2142-2014; Blesa, Javier/GLQ-5299-2022","Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Juri, Carlos/0000-0002-1939-5976; Collantes, María/0000-0003-1162-1470; Prieto, Elena/0000-0002-3609-1210; Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Pineda-Pardo, Jose Angel/0000-0002-8776-0031; Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-0534-5182; Trigo Damas, Ines/0000-0002-7821-2973; , Natalia/0000-0002-1546-1825","UTE-CIMA agreement of the University of Navarra; Comunidad de Madrid [S2017/BMD-3700]; Structural Funds of the European Union; Fundacion Jesus de Gangoiti (Bilbao, Spain); ISCIII [CP15/00200]; Faculty of Medicine [BEAGAL18/00098]; Grant for I + D Projects for the Beatriz Galindo Program Researchers at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid [SI2/PBG/202000014]; Chair in Neuroscience UAM-Fundacion Tatiana Perez de Guzman el Bueno","UTE-CIMA agreement of the University of Navarra; Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); Structural Funds of the European Union; Fundacion Jesus de Gangoiti (Bilbao, Spain); ISCIII(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Faculty of Medicine; Grant for I + D Projects for the Beatriz Galindo Program Researchers at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; Chair in Neuroscience UAM-Fundacion Tatiana Perez de Guzman el Bueno","We thank the cyclotron staff of the Nuclear Medicine Department and PET-GMP Laboratory of Clinica Universidad de Navarra for radiotracer production.

The simulations predict that the working memory deficits observed in Parkinson's disease result from a local dysfunction within the brain due to a problem in the disinhibitory process arising from the basal ganglia. They also predict that the working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia involve many cortical and subcortical areas and result from a problem in selecting items in working memory which are stored in basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops.

Moreover, dopaminergic projections and D-1/D-5 receptor distributions display a layer-dependent organization, suggesting specific functions in the cortical circuitry. However, the circuit effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission in sensory cortex and their possible roles in perception, learning, and memory are largely unknown. Here, we investigated layer-specific circuit effects of dopaminergic neuromodulation using current source density (CSD) analysis in AI of Mongolian gerbils. Pharmacological stimulation of D1/D5 receptors increased auditory-evoked synaptic currents in infragranular layers, prolonging local thalamocortical input via positive feedback between infragranular output and granular input. Subsequently, dopamine promoted sustained cortical activation by prolonged recruitment of long-range corticocortical networks. A detailed circuit analysis combining layer-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), CSD analysis, and pharmacological cortical silencing revealed that cross-laminar feedback enhanced by dopamine relied on a positive, fast-acting recurrent corticoefferent loop, most likely relayed via local thalamic circuits. Behavioral signal detection analysis further showed that activation of corticoefferent output by infragranular ICMS, which mimicked auditory activation under dopaminergic influence, was most effective in eliciting a behaviorally detectable signal. Our results show that D-1/D-5-mediated dopaminergic modulation in sensory cortex regulates positive recurrent corticoefferent feedback, which enhances states of high, persistent activity in sensory cortex evoked by behaviorally relevant stimuli. In boosting horizontal network interactions, this potentially promotes the readout of task-related information from cortical synapses and improves behavioral stimulus detection.","[Happel, Max F.

Although the basic structure is similar for each cortical area, specialized neural connections likely mediate unique information processing requirements. Relative to primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices, little is known about the intrinsic connectivity of primary auditory cortex (A1). To better understand the flow of information from the thalamus to and through rat A1, we made use of a rapid, high-throughput screening method exploiting laser-induced uncaging of glutamate to construct excitatory input maps of individual neurons. We found that excitatory inputs to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were similar to those in V1 and S1; these cells received strong excitation primarily from layers 2-4. Both anatomical and physiological observations, however, indicate that inputs and outputs of layer 4 excitatory neurons in A1 contrast with those in V1 and S1. Layer 2/3 pyramids in A1 have substantial axonal arbors in layer 4, and photostimulation demonstrates that these pyramids can connect to layer 4 excitatory neurons. Furthermore, most or all of these layer 4 excitatory neurons project out of the local cortical circuit. Unlike S1 and V1, where feedback to layer 4 is mediated exclusively by indirect local circuits involving layer 2/3 projections to deep layers and deep feedback to layer 4, layer 4 of A1 integrates thalamic and strong layer 4 recurrent excitatory input with relatively direct feedback from layer 2/3 and provides direct cortical output.","[Barbour, Dennis L.] Washington Univ, Lab Sensory Neurosci & Neuroengn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Callaway, Edward M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Labs, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Washington University (WUSTL); Salk Institute","Barbour, DL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Lab Sensory Neurosci & Neuroengn, Campus Box 1097,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.","dbarbour@biomed.wustl.edu","Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011","Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267; Barbour, Dennis/0000-0003-0851-0665","National Institutes of Health [EY010742, DC008880]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants EY010742 (E.M.C.) and DC008880 (D.L.B.).

We are interested in questions about the processing of communication calls and their representation within the mammalian auditory cortex. Our studies compare in particular two species for which a large body of data has accumulated: the mustached bat and the rhesus monkey. We conclude that the brains of both species share a number of functional and organizational principles, which differ only in the extent to which and how they are implemented. For instance, neurons in both species use combination-sensitivity (nonlinear spectral and temporal integration of stimulus components) as a basic mechanism to enable exquisite sensitivity to and selectivity for particular call types. Whereas combination-sensitivity is already found abundantly at the primary auditory cortical and also at subcortical levels in bats, it becomes prevalent only at the level of the lateral belt in the secondary auditory cortex of monkeys. A parallel-hierarchical framework for processing complex sounds up to the level of the auditory cortex in bats and an organization into parallel-hierarchical, cortico-cortical auditory processing streams in monkeys is another common principle. Response specialization of neurons seems to be more pronounced in bats than in monkeys, whereas a functional specialization into what and where streams in the cerebral cortex is more pronounced in monkeys than in bats. These differences, in part, are due to the increased number and larger size of auditory areas in the parietal and frontal cortex in primates. Accordingly, the computational prowess of neural networks and the functional hierarchy resulting in specializations is established early and accelerated across brain regions in bats. The principles proposed here for the neural management of species-specific calls in bats and primates can be tested by studying the details of call processing in additional species. Also, computational modeling in conjunction with coordinated studies in bats and monkeys can help to clarify the fundamental question of perceptual invariance (or constancy) in call recognition, which has obvious relevance for understanding speech perception and its disorders in humans.","Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington, DC 20057 USA","Georgetown University","Kanwal, JS (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Biophys, 3900 Reservoir Rd,NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.","kanwalj@georgetown.edu","Rauschecker, Josef P/A-4120-2013; Kanwal, Jagmeet S./D-2145-2009","Kanwal, Jagmeet S./0000-0002-4529-3631; Rauschecker, Josef P./0000-0003-4353-9084","NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC003489, DC03789, DC02054, R01 DC002054, R01 DC003489-05] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R56 NS052494, R01 NS052494] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,115,43,44,0,37,"FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE INC","IRVINE","16471 SCIENTIFIC WAY, IRVINE, CA 92618 USA","1093-9946","1093-4715",,"FRONT BIOSCI-LANDMRK","Front.

Patients are afflicted primarily with progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Studies in mice, cats, and sheep have indicated safety and widespread distribution of Hex in the CNS after intracranial vector infusion of AAVrh8 vectors encoding species-specific Hex alpha- or beta-subunits at a 1: 1 ratio. Here, a safety study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques (cm), modeling previous animal studies, with bilateral infusion in the thalamus as well as in left lateral ventricle of AAVrh8 vectors encoding cm Hex alpha- and beta-subunits. Three doses (3.2 x 10(12) vg [n= 3]; 3.2 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]; or 1.1 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]) were tested, with controls infused with vehicle (n= 1) or transgene empty AAVrh8 vector at the highest dose (n= 2). Most monkeys receiving AAVrh8-cmHexa/b developed dyskinesias, ataxia, and loss of dexterity, with higher dose animals eventually becoming apathetic. Time to onset of symptoms was dose dependent, with the highest-dose cohort producing symptoms within a month of infusion. One monkey in the lowest-dose cohort was behaviorally asymptomatic but had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the thalami. Histopathology was similar in all monkeys injected with AAVrh8cm-Hex alpha/beta, showing severe white and gray matter necrosis along the injection track, reactive vasculature, and the presence of neurons with granular eosinophilic material. Lesions were minimal to absent in both control cohorts. Despite cellular loss, a dramatic increase in Hex activity was measured in the thalamus, and none of the animals presented with antibody titers against Hex. The high overexpression of Hex protein is likely to blame for this negative outcome, and this study demonstrates the variations in safety profiles of AAVrh8-Hex alpha/beta intracranial injection among different species, despite encoding for self-proteins.","[Golebiowski, Diane; Maitland, Stacy; GuhaSarkar, Dwijit; Sena-Esteves, Miguel] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Worcester, MA USA; [Golebiowski, Diane; Maitland, Stacy; GuhaSarkar, Dwijit; Sena-Esteves, Miguel] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Horae Gene Therapy Ctr, Worcester, MA USA; [van der Bom, Imramsjah M.

Visual responses were recorded from neurones in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in two species of New World monkeys - the diurnal squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the nocturnal owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatis). Recording sites were reconstructed in postmortem tissue and comparisons were made between the response properties of magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 2. Receptive fields were characterized with both white noise and drifting gratings. We found that most of the differences between magnocellular and parvocellular neurones that have been described in the macaque monkey hold for the squirrel monkey and owl monkey. In squirrel monkey and owl monkey, receptive fields of magnocellular neurones were larger than those of parvocellular neurones at similar eccentricities. Although visual responses in the owl monkey were significantly slower than in the squirrel monkey, in both species magnocellular neurones differed from parvocellular neurones in that their responses (1) had higher contrast gains, (2) tended to peak at higher temporal frequencies (but with considerable overlap), (3) had shorter response latencies, and (4) were more transient. 3. The strength of a neurone's receptive-field surround was assessed by comparing neuronal responses to gratings of optimal spatial frequency with responses to gratings of low spatial frequency. Using this approach, receptive-field surrounds were found to be equally strong on average for magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 4. Spatial summation, as measured by a null test, was linear for all magnocellular and parvocellular cells tested; that is, Y cells were not observed in either species. Finally, most magnocellular neurones showed a contrast gain control mechanism, although this was not seen for parvocellular neurones.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Reid, RC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","clay_reid@hms.harvard.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [P30 EY012196, EY06604, F32 EY006604, EY10115, EY12196, R01 EY010115] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,55,56,57,0,6,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3751","1469-7793",,"J PHYSIOL-LONDON","J.

Tic generation has been linked to disturbed networks of brain areas involved in planning, controlling and execution of actions, particularly structural and functional disorders in the striatum and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. We therefore applied structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize changes in intrahemispheric white matter connectivity in cortico-subcortical circuits engaged in motor control in 15 GTS patients without psychiatric comorbidities. White matter connectivity was analyzed by probabilistic fiber tractography between 12 pre-defined cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Connectivity values were combined with measures of clinical severity rated by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). GTS patients showed widespread structural connectivity deficits. Lower connectivity values were found specifically in tracts connecting the supplementary motor areas (SMA) with basal ganglia (pre-SMA-putamen, SMA-putamen) and in frontal cortico-cortical circuits. There was an overall trend towards negative correlations between structural connectivity in these tracts and YGTSS scores. Structural connectivity of frontal brain networks involved in planning, controlling and executing actions is reduced in adult GTS patients which is associated with tic severity. These findings are in line with the concept of GTS as a neurodevelopmental disorder of brain immaturity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the spatial organization of the connections that link digit representations of areas 3b with other somatosensory areas is less understood. Here we examined the cortical inputs to individual digit representations of area 3b in four squirrel monkeys and one prosimian galago. Retrograde tracers were injected into neurophysiologically defined representations of individual digits of area 3b. Cortical tissues were cut parallel to the surface in some cases and showed that feedback projections to individual digits overlapped extensively in the hand representations of areas 3b, 1, and parietal ventral (PV) and second somatosensory (S2) areas. Other regions with overlapping populations of labeled cells included area 3a and primary motor cortex (M1). The results were confirmed in other cases in which the cortical tissues were cut in the coronal plane. The same cases also showed that cells were primarily labeled in the infragranular and supragranular layers. Thus, feedback projections to individual digit representations in area 3b mainly originate from multiple digits and other portions of hand representations of areas 3b, 1, PV, and S2. This organization is in stark contrast to the segregated thalamocortical inputs, which originate in single digit representations and terminate in the matching digit representation in the cortex. The organization of feedback connections could provide a substrate for the integration of information across the representations of adjacent digits in area 3b. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3768-3790, 2013.

PM participates in integrative and modulatory functions, including directed attention, and consistently exhibits alterations in disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite essential cognitive functions, the cortical inputs to the PM have not been systematically investigated. To date, less than 20 cortices have been demonstrated to project to PM. The goal of this study was to establish a comprehensive map of the cortical afferents to PM in the marmoset monkey. Using a magnetic resonance imaging-guided injection approach, we reveal 62 discrete cortices projecting to the adult marmoset PM. We confirmed previously reported connections and identified further projections from discrete cortices across the temporal, parietal, retrosplenial-cingulate, prefrontal, and orbital lobes. These regions encompass areas recipient of PM efferents, demonstrating the reciprocity of the PM-cortical connectivity. Moreover, our results indicate that PM neurones projecting to distinct cortices are intermingled and form multimodal cell clusters. This microunit organization, believed to facilitate cross-modal integration, contrasts with the large functional subdivisions usually observed in thalamic nuclei. Altogether, we provide the first comprehensive map of PM cortical afferents, an essential stepping stone in expanding our knowledge of PM and its function.","[Homman-Ludiye, Jihane; Mundinano, Inaki Carril; Kwan, William C.; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute; Monash University","Bourne, JA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, 15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.","james.bourne@monash.edu","Kwan, William/HMW-0054-2023; Bourne, James/B-5265-2018","Kwan, William/0000-0002-3097-969X; Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108; Mundinano, Inaki-Carril/0000-0003-1063-7550","National Health andMedical Research Council (NHMRC) [APP 1077677]; Australian Research Council [DP190101948]; Brain and Behavior Foundation (NARSAD) Independent Investigator Grant; State Government of Victoria; Australian Government","National Health andMedical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Brain and Behavior Foundation (NARSAD) Independent Investigator Grant; State Government of Victoria; Australian Government(Australian Government)","JAB is supported by a Senior Research Fellowship support (APP 1077677) fromthe National Health andMedical Research Council (NHMRC).

Currently, there are no effective therapies for this disease. Previously, we have shown that RNA interference mediated silencing of ATXN1 mRNA provides therapeutic benefit in mouse models of the disease. Adeno-associated viral delivery of an engineered microRNA targeting ATXN1 to the cerebella of well-established mouse models improved motor phenotypes, neuropathy, and transcriptional changes. Here, we test the translatability of this approach in adult rhesus cerebella. Nine adult male and three adult female rhesus macaque were unilaterally injected with our therapeutic vector, a recombinant adeno-associated virus type 1 (rAAV1) expressing our RNAi trigger (miS1) and co-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rAAV1.miS1eGFP) into the deep cerebellar nuclei using magnetic resonance imaging guided techniques combined with a Stealth Navigation system (Medtronics Inc.). Transduction was evident in the deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar Purkinje cells, the brainstem and the ventral lateral thalamus. Reduction of endogenous ATXN1 messenger RNA levels were a parts per thousand yen30% in the deep cerebellar nuclei, the cerebellar cortex, inferior olive, and thalamus relative to the uninjected hemisphere. There were no clinical complications, and quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that this therapeutic intervention strategy and subsequent reduction of ATXN1 is well tolerated.

However, when simulations are conducted on models with sufficient biophysical details, great challenges arise from limited computer power, thereby restricting most existing computational works with biophysical models only to small-scale networks. On the other hand, with the emergence of powerful computing platforms, many recent works are geared to performing large-scale simulations with simple spiking models. However, the applicability of those works is limited by the nature of the underlying phenomenological model. To bridge the gap, an intermediate step is taken to construct a scalable brain model with sufficient biophysical details. In this work, great efforts are devoted to taking into account not only local cortical microcircuits but also the global brain architecture, and efficient techniques are proposed and adopted to address the associated computational challenges in simulation of networks of such complexity. With the customized simulator developed, we are able to simulate the brain model to generate not only sleep spindle and delta waves but also the spike-and-wave pattern of absence seizures, and directly link those behaviors to underlying biophysical mechanism. Those initial results are interesting because they show the possibility to determine underlying causes of diseases by simulating the biologically realistic brain model. With further development, the work is geared to assisting the clinicians in selecting the optimal treatment on an individual basis in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An algorithm for subdivision of the cerebral central white matter according to topographic criteria is developed in the companion manuscript. In the present paper we provide a rationale for this system of parcellation of the central white matter and we extend the system of cerebral parcellation to include principal subcortical gray structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. The volumetric measures of the subcortical gray and white matter parcellation units in 20 young adult brains are computed and reported here as well. In addition, with the comprehensive system for cerebral gray and white matter structure parcellation as reference, we formulate a systematics of forebrain connectivity. The degree to which functionally specific brain areas correspond to topographically specific areas is an open empirical issue. The resolution of this issue requires the development of topographically specific anatomic analyses, such as presented in the current system, and the application of such systems to a comprehensive set of functional-anatomic correlation studies in order to establish the degree of structural-functional correspondence. This system is expected to be applied in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience as an MRI-based topographic systematics of human forebrain anatomy with normative volumetric reference and also as a system of reference for the anatomic organization of specific neural systems as disrupted by focal lesions in lesion-deficit correlations.

Despite the clinical need to understand the neuronal bases of hand function recovery after spinal and/or nerve injuries, relatively few groups have systematically related subtle changes in voluntary hand use following injury to neuronal mechanisms in the monkey. Human and macaque hand anatomy and function are strikingly similar, which makes the macaque the favored nonhuman primate model for the study of postinjury dexterity. In this review of monkey models of cervical spinal injury that have successfully related voluntary hand use to neuronal responses during the early postinjury months, the focus is on the dorsal rhizotomy ( or dorsal rootlet lesion) model developed and used in our laboratory over the last several years. The review also describes macaque monkey models of injuries to the more central cervical spine (e. g., hemisection, dorsal column) that illustrate methods to assess postlesion hand function and that relate it to neurophysiological and neuro-anatomical changes. Such models are particularly important for understanding what the sensorimotor pathways are capable of, and for assessing the outcome of therapeutic interventions as they are developed.","Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University","Darian-Smith, C (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comparat Med, Edwards Bldg,Room R350,300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","CDarian@cmexchange.stanford.edu",,"Darian-Smith, Corinna/0000-0002-4753-4574",,,,,109,21,21,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1084-2020","1930-6180",,"ILAR J","ILAR J.",,2007,48,4,,,,,396,410,,"10.1093/ilar.48.4.396","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ilar.48.4.396"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ilar.48.4.396"")",,,15,"Veterinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Veterinary Sciences","266PB",17712225,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000253447300008","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000253447300008"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Specifically, we were interested in the timing relationship between axon outgrowth and known temporal patterns of neurogenesis in the LGN and striate cortex. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were selected for study because of their immature developmental state in late gestation and relatively large litters. We examined axon outgrowth from the retina, and anlagen of presumptive LGN and striate cortex between embryonic day 21-30 (E21-E30) using in situ inoculations of two fluorescent lipophilic dyes, Dil and DiA. Dil inoculations were made into the cortex and contralateral thalamus, and DiA inoculations were made into the contralateral eye. Retinal axon termination zones in the diencephalon following the DiA inoculations were used to validate the location of the LGN. Visual cortex and LGN neurogenesis begins at E20 in ferrets. No axon outgrowth could be documented from retina or anlagen of striate cortex and LGN until E24. At E24 some retinal axons reach and cross the chiasm, cortical axons extend some distance within the cortical radiations, and thalamic axons are within the internal capsule. Retinogeniculate, geniculocortical, and corticogeniculate axons extend to their target structures by E27, as evidenced by retrograde labeling in cells of origin. These data suggest that in the ferret retina, and developing LGN and striate cortex, (1) axon outgrowth from each visual area begins within 24-h of each other, after neurogenesis has begun at the source but before it is complete in the target; (2) axons may be generated before parent cell bodies have completed migration; and (3) arriving axons are in a position to influence target structures almost from their inception.","VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT CELL BIOL,MED CTR N C2310,NASHVILLE,TN 37232; VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240","Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University",,,,,"NCRR NIH HHS [RR05424-30] Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [P30-EY08126, EY05038] Funding Source: Medline","NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,42,50,51,0,2,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211","0952-5238",,,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","JAN-FEB",1993,10,1,,,,,117,130,,"10.1017/S0952523800003266","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800003266"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800003266"")",,,14,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","KG297",8424921,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993KG29700010","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993KG29700010"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements with [C-11](R)-MeQAA, [C-11]PIB, and [F-18]BCPP-EF were conducted in monkeys in a conscious condition. [C-11](R)-MeQAA binding was analyzed by a simplified reference tissue model to calculate nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), [C-11]PIB uptake was calculated by standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), and [F-18]BCPP-EF binding was determined by Logan graphical analysis to calculate total distribution volume (V-T) with arterial blood sampling. Higher brain uptake was determined in the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and cortical regions for [C-11](R)-MeQAA, while being lower in the cerebellum. Significant age-related reduction of [C-11](R)-MeQAA binding to 7-nAChR was determined only in the occipital cortex. The plot of Vt of [F-18]BCPP-EF against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA indicated a significant negative correlation in the hippocampus and cortical regions in aged animals. Plotting of SUVR of [C-11]PIB against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA showed a positive correlation. The in vivo binding of [C-11](R)-MeQAA could reflect the upregulation of 7-nAChR induced by neurodegenerative damage determined by A deposition as well as impaired MC-I activity in living brain.

The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) fire in relation to primary rewards and reward-conditioned stimuli, but not to rewards that are expected. It has been hypothesized that the anatomical framework for the selective response of these neurons is organized in the projections from some paralimbic areas in the frontal robe to the striosomes of the caudate nucleus, which are also directly connected with the dopaminergic neurons of the SNC. Here, we present two additional pathways that may be related with this neurophysiological finding. We hypothesize that the connections of the paralimbic cortices with the ventral system of the basal ganglia and then with the thalamus and the hypothalamus, and the circuit ventral striatum-substantia nigra pars reticulata-thalamus-striatum could be also involved in the reward-based learning.

Primates have traditionally been used in these studies because of their ability to perform more complex behaviors closely akin to those of humans, a desirable prerequisite since our ultimate aim is to elucidate the neuronal correlates of human behaviors. A wealth of knowledge has accumulated on the sensory and motor systems such as vision, audition, and eye movements. For more demanding behaviors where the main focus has been on attention, recordings in awake primates have begun to yield valuable data on the centers of the brain that are reactive to different attributes of this behavior. As a result, various hypotheses of the origin and distribution of attentional effects have evolved. For instance, visual attentional effects have been described not only in the higher cortical area (W) but also in areas earlier in the visual pathway which presumably involve a feedback mechanism in the latter region. Here we outline the ways in which we have successfully used these methods to make single-cell recordings in awake macaques to show how certain behavioral paradigms affect neurons of the thalamus (with emphasis on the lateral geniculate nucleus). As we have done with established techniques these methods can be readily adapted to incorporate most behaviors needed to be tested and allow recordings to be made in virtually any part of the brain.

First published April 13, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00327.2010.-Invasive microelectrode recordings measure neuronal spikes, which are commonly considered inaccessible through standard surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Yet high-frequency EEG potentials (hf-EEG, f > 400 Hz) found in somatosensory evoked potentials of primates may reflect the mean population spike responses of coactivated cortical neurons. Since cortical responses to electrical nerve stimulation vary strongly from trial to trial, we investigated whether the hf-EEG signal can also echo single-trial variability observed at the single-unit level. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of behaving macaque monkeys and identified variable spike burst responses following peripheral stimulation. Each of these responses was classified according to the timing of its spike constituents, conforming to one of a discrete set of spike patterns. We here show that these spike patterns are accompanied by variations in the concomitant epidural hf-EEG. These variations cannot be explained by fluctuating stimulus efficacy, suggesting that they were generated within the thalamocortical network. As high-frequency EEG signals can also be reliably recorded from the scalp of human subjects, they may provide a noninvasive window on fluctuating cortical spike activity in humans.","[Telenczuk, Bartosz] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Telenczuk, Bartosz; Curio, Gabriel] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Baker, Stuart N.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Herz, Andreas V.

Three monkeys were trained to grasp an unseen instrumented object between the thumb and index finger and to lift and hold it stationary within a position window for 2-2.5 s. The grip and load forces and the object displacement were measured on each trial. Sin.-le-unit activity was recorded from the hand regions in the PMv and PMd. In some conditions a predictable perturbation was applied to the object after 1,500 ms of static holding, whereas in other conditions different random combinations of perturbed and unperturbed trials were given. In the perturbed conditions, some were randomly and intermittently presented with a warning flash, whereas some were unsignaled. The activities of 198 cells were modulated during the task performance. Of these cells, 151 were located in the PMv, and 47 were located in the PMd. Although both PMv and PMd neurons had similar discharge patterns, more PMd neurons (84 vs. 43%) showed early pregrip activity. Forty of 106 PMv and 10/30 PMd cells responded to the perturbation with reflexlike triggered reactions. The latency of this response was always <100 ms with a mean of about 55 ms in both the PMv and the PMd. In contrast, 106 PMv and 30 PMd cells tested with the perturbations, only 9 and 10%, respectively, showed significant but nonspecific adaptations to the perturbation. The warning stimulus did not increase the occurrence of specific responses to the perturbation even though 21 of 42 cells related to the grip task also responded to moving visual stimuli. The responses were retinal and frequently involved limited portions of both foveal and peripheral visual fields. When tested with a 75 x 5.5-cm dark bar on a light background, these cells were sensitive to the direction of movement. In summary, the periarcuate premotor area activity to related to predictable force-pulse perturbations seems to reflect a general increase in excitability in contrast to a more specific anticipatory activity such as recorded in the cerebellum. In spite of the strong cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections, the results of the present study suggest that the cortical premotor areas are not involved in the elaboration of adaptive internal models of hand-object dynamics.","Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sci Neurol, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3T8, Canada","Universite de Montreal","Smith, AM (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sci Neurol, Dept Physiol, CP 6128 Succ A, Montreal, PQ H3C 3T8, Canada.",,,,,,,,57,20,20,1,3,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

New restorative therapies for Parkinson disease, aimed at delivering drugs or cells to the substantia nigra (SN), are becoming available. Therefore, precise surgical approaches to the dopaminergic cell-containing region of the SN are required to avoid damage to nearby structures such as the corticospinal tract and subthalamic nucleus. In a study conducted in nonhuman primates, the authors evaluated the utility and accuracy of electrophysiological techniques in localizing the SN. Three adult rhesus monkeys were used as hosts for intranigal cell transplants. The monkeys were rendered hemiparkinsonian by intracarotid injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. With the aid of stereotactic guidance, chronic recording chambers were placed on the skull of each monkey and directed at the SN. In each monkey, 20 to 40 trajectories were explored with a microelectrode. Spontaneous and movement-related single-unit activities were recorded in the SN, pars reticulata, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, striatum, thalamus, and red nucleus. Motor and ocular responses to microstimulation in the subthalamic area were noted. Using the electrophysiological and stereotactic information that was obtained, three-dimensional maps of the nigral complex were constructed to infer the location of the SN pars compacta. The maps were subsequently used to guide intranigral placement of fetal dopaminergic cells. Accurate delivery was verified by histological analysis. Based on the characteristic electrophysiological properties of the SN and surrounding structures in the parkinsonian state, microelectrode recording techniques may be used to ensure accurate placement of cell transplantation in the intranigral.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosurg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Emory University; Emory University","Starr, PA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurosurg, Moffitt Hosp 779, 505 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",,,"Subramanian, Thyagarajan/0000-0001-5930-017X",,,,,33,19,19,0,2,"AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS","CHARLOTTESVILLE","UNIV VIRGINIA, 1224 WEST MAIN ST, STE 450, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903 USA","0022-3085",,,"J NEUROSURG","J.

It has been thought that the thalamus prevents the relay of sensory information to cortex during sleep, but the consequences for cortical responses to sensory signals in this physiological state remain unclear. We recorded from two auditory cortical areas downstream of the thalamus in naturally sleeping marmoset monkeys. Single neurons in primary auditory cortex either increased or decreased their responses during sleep compared with wakefulness. In lateral belt, a secondary auditory cortical area, the response modulation was also bidirectional and showed no clear systematic depressive effect of sleep. When averaged across neurons, sound-evoked activity in these two auditory cortical areas was surprisingly well preserved during sleep. Neural responses to acoustic stimulation were present during both slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep, were repeatedly observed over multiple sleep cycles, and demonstrated similar discharge patterns to the responses recorded during wakefulness in the same neuron. Our results suggest that the thalamus is not as effective a gate for the flow of sensory information as previously thought. At the cortical stage, a novel pattern of activation/deactivation appears across neurons. Because the neural signal reaches as far as secondary auditory cortex, this leaves open the possibility of altered sensory processing of auditory information during sleep.","[Issa, Elias B.; Wang, Xiaoqin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Johns Hopkins University","Wang, XQ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, 720 Rutland Ave,Traylor 410, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.","xiaoqin.wang@jhu.edu",,"Issa, Elias/0000-0002-5387-7207","National Institutes of Health [R01 DC-03180]; Whitaker Fellowship","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitaker Fellowship","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 DC-03180 ( X.

The neural input into these sectors was investigated with the help of large horseradish peroxidase injections that covered the different sectors of orbitofrontal cortex. The distribution of retrograde labeling showed that the majority of the cortical projections to orbitofrontal cortex arises from a restricted set of telencephalic sources, which include prefrontal cortex, lateral, and inferomedial temporal cortex, the temporal pole, cingulate gyrus, insula, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and claustrum. The posterior portion of the orbitofrontal cortex receives additional input from the piriform cortex and the anterolateral portion from gustatory, somatosensory, and premotor areas. Thalamic projections to the orbitofrontal cortex arise from midline and intralaminar nuclei, from the anteromedial nucleus, the medial dorsal nucleus, and the pulvinar nucleus. Orbitofrontal cortex also receives projections from the hypothalamus, nucleus basalis, ventral tegmental area, the raphe nuclei, the nucleus locus coeruleus, and scattered neurons of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. The non-isocortical (agranular-dysgranular) sectors of orbitofrontal cortex receive more intense projections from the non-isocortical sectors of paralimbic areas, the hippocampus, amygdala, and midline thalamic nuclei, whereas the isocortical (granular) sector receives more intense projections from the dorsolateral prefrontal area, the granular insula, granular temporopolar cortex, posterolateral temporal cortex, and from the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. Retrograde labeling within cingulate, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices was most pronounced when the injection site extended medially into the dysgranular paraolfactory cortex of the gyrus rectus, an area that can be conceptualized as an orbitofrontal extension of the cingulate complex. These observations demonstrate that the orbitofrontal cortex has cytoarchitectonically organized projections and that it provides a convergence zone for afferents from heteromodal association and limbic areas. The diverse connections of orbitofrontal cortex are in keeping with the participation of this region in visceral, gustatory, and olfactory functions and with its importance in memory, motivation, and epileptogenesis.","BETH ISRAEL HOSP, DEPT NEUROL, DIV NEUROSCI & BEHAV NEUROL, BULLARD & DENNY BROWN LABS, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA","Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center",,,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS 20285] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,83,424,428,0,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

What is the Bereitschaftspotential? Clin Neurophysiol 2006; 117:2341-56) were studied in patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MID) to elucidate the pathophysiology of voluntary movement. Methods: We studied nine genetically proven MJD patients and eight age-matched healthy subjects. Multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained during self-paced fast extensions of the wrist. EEG epochs were time-locked to electromyography (EMG) onset or offset of the voluntary EMG burst and averaged. Results: In the MJD patients, the early Bereitschaftspotential (early BP, -1500 to -500 ms) was not affected but the late BP was reduced over the central midline area and contralaterally to the movement side. The amplitude of the fpMP, a post-movement MRCP component, was also reduced. In addition, the offset cortical potential in the first 500 ms after EMG offset (Moff + 500) was attenuated bilaterally over a wide cortical area. Conclusions: Findings suggest that cortical activations associated with the initiation and termination of a voluntary movement are impaired in MJD patients. Significance: Abnormalities of pre- and post-movement MRCP components provide researchers with pathophysiological insight into voluntary motor dysfunction in MJD.

To better understand the mechanisms contributing to brain injury and improve outcomes in neonates with HIE, better preclinical animal models that mimic the clinical situation following birth asphyxia in term newborns are needed. In an effort to achieve this goal, we modified our nonhuman primate model of HIE induced by in utero umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) to include postnatal hypoxic episodes, in order to simulate apneic events in human neonates with HIE. We describe a cohort of 4 near-term fetal Macaca nemestrina that underwent 18 min of in utero UCO, followed by cesarean section delivery, resuscitation, and subsequent postnatal mechanical ventilation, with exposure to intermittent daily hypoxia (3 min, 8% O-2 3-8 times daily for 3 days). After delivery, all animals demonstrated severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7 +/- 0.12; mean +/- SD) and low APGAR scores (< 5 at 10 min of age). Three of 4 animals had both electrographic and clinical seizures. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma metabolites were determined by 2-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). The 4 UCO animals and a single nonas-phyxiated animal (delivered by cesarean section but without exposure to UCO or prolonged sedation) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 8 of life. Thalamic injury was present on MRI in 3 UCO animals, but not in the control animal. Following necropsy on day 8, brain histopathology revealed neuronal injury/loss and gliosis in portions of the ventrolateral thalamus in all 4 UCO, with 2 animals also demonstrating putamen/globus pallidus involvement. In addition, all 4 UCO animals demonstrated brain stem gliosis, with neuronal loss present in the midbrain, pons, and lateral medulla in 3 of 4 animals. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of the brain tissues was performed, which demonstrated ultrastructural white matter abnormalities, characterized by perinuclear vacuolation and axonal dilation, in 3 of 4 animals. Immunolabeling of Nogo-A, a negative regulator of neuronal growth, was not increased in the injured brains compared to 2 control animals. Using GC x GC-TOFMS, we identified metabolites previously recognized as potential biomarkers of perinatal asphyxia. The basal ganglia-thala-mus-brain stem injury produced by UCO is consistent with the deep nuclear/brainstem injury pattern seen in human UCO model permits timely detection of biomarkers associated with specific patterns of neonatal brain injury, and it may ultimately be useful for validating therapeutic strategies to treat neonatal HIE.

There are, however, critical, substantive differences in the neuroendocrinology of puberty among species. The onset of puberty in the human is marked by an increase in the amplitude of LH pulses, an indirect indicator of the increase in amplitude of LHRH pulses. The hypothalamic LHRH-pituitary gonadotrophin complex is functional by at least 0.3 gestation in the human foetus; the sex difference in the fetal and neonatal pattern of LH and FSH secretion is an apparent consequence of imprinting of the fetal hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadotropin apparatus by fetal testosterone. Until about 6 months of age in boys and 12-24 months in girls, the testes and ovaries respond to the increased LH in boys and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in girls by secreting testosterone and oestradiol, respectively, reaching levels that are not again achieved before the onset of puberty, Striking features of the ontogeny of the human hypothalamic pulse generator are: (1) its development and function in the foetus; (2) the continued function of the hypothalamic LHRH pulse generator-pituitary gonadotrophingonadal axis in infancy; (3) the gradual damping of hypo-thalamic LHRH oscillator activity during late infancy; (4) its quiescence during childhood - the so-called juvenile pause; (5) during late childhood the gradual disinhibition and reactivation of the LHRH pulse generator, mainly at night; (6) the increasing amplitude of the LHRH pulses, which are reflected in the progressively increased and changing pattern of circulating LH pulses, with the approach of and during puberty. The intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of the LHRH pulse generator during childhood (the juvenile phase) involve the major role of an inhibitory neuronal system -the CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABAergic neurons, as revealed by studies in the rhesus monkey by Terasawa and her associates. With the onset of puberty, the disinhibition and reactivation of the LHRH pulse generator is associated with a fall in GABAergic neurotransmission and a concomitant increase in the input of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters (including glutamate) and possibly astroglial-derived growth factors. Despite remarkable progress over the past three decades, large gaps remain in our understanding of the neurobiological, genetic and environmental mechanisms involved in the control of the onset of puberty. The role of leptin in the control of the onset of puberty is reviewed. Severe leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; it appears that a critical level of leptin and a leptin signal is required to achieve puberty. The weight of evidence supports the hypothesis that leptin acts as one of several permissive factors and not a trigger in the onset of human puberty. The application of these advances provides a framework for the described classification of sexual precocity and delayed puberty. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG.

The first aim of this work was to compare two alpha(7) nAChRs PET radioligands, [F-18]ASEM (3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-6-([F-18]fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide) and [F-18]DBT-10 (7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-([F-18]fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide), in nonhuman primates. The second aim was to assess further the quantification and test-retest variability of [F-18]ASEM in humans. PET scans with high specific activity [F-18]ASEM or [F-18]DBT-10 were acquired in three rhesus monkeys (one male, two female), and the kinetic properties of these radiotracers were compared. Additional [F-18]ASEM PET scans with blocking doses of nicotine, varenicline, and cold ASEM were acquired separately in two animals. Next, six human subjects (five male, one female) were imaged with [F-18]ASEM PET for 180 min, and arterial sampling was used to measure the parent input function. Different modeling approaches were compared to identify the optimal analysis method and scan duration for quantification of [F-18]ASEM distribution volume (V (T)). In addition, retest scans were acquired in four subjects (three male, one female), and the test-retest variability of V (T) was assessed. In the rhesus monkey brain [F-18]ASEM and [F-18]DBT-10 exhibited highly similar kinetic profiles. Dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]ASEM binding was observed, while administration of either nicotine or varenicline did not change [F-18]ASEM V (T). [F-18]ASEM was selected for further validation because it has been used in humans. Accurate quantification of [F-18]ASEM V (T) in humans was achieved using multilinear analysis with at least 90 min of data acquisition, resulting in V (T) values ranging from 19.6 +/- 2.5 mL/cm(3) in cerebellum to 25.9 +/- 2.9 mL/cm(3) in thalamus. Test-retest variability of V (T) was 11.7 +/- 9.8%. These results confirm [F-18]ASEM as a suitable radiotracer for the imaging and quantification of alpha(7) nAChRs in humans.","[Hillmer, Ansel T.; Li, Songye; Zheng, Ming-Qiang; Lin, Shu-fei; Nabulsi, Nabeel; Holden, Daniel; Pracitto, Richard; Labaree, David; Ropchan, Jim; Esterlis, Irina; Cosgrove, Kelly P.; Carson, Richard E.; Huang, Yiyun] Yale Univ, PET Ctr, POB 208048,801 Howard Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Scheunemann, Matthias; Teodoro, Rodrigo; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie; Brust, Peter] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiopharmaceut Canc Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Yale University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR)","Hillmer, AT (corresponding author), Yale Univ, PET Ctr, POB 208048,801 Howard Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","ansel.hillmer@yale.edu","Carson, Richard E/H-3250-2011; , Ansel/AAV-6622-2020; Cosgrove, Kelly P/J-7004-2013; Esterlis, Irina/J-6153-2014","Carson, Richard E/0000-0002-9338-7966; , Ansel/0000-0002-8105-1381; Esterlis, Irina/0000-0001-6293-1458; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie/0000-0003-3168-3062; Cosgrove, Kelly/0000-0003-1351-9576","NIH [T32 DA022975, R01 DA015577, K02 DA031750, K01 MH092681]; Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DE 1165/2-3]; CTSA from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [UL1 TR000142]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); CTSA from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS))","This work was supported by NIH T32 DA022975, R01 DA015577, K02 DA031750, K01 MH092681 and the Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD.

When most humans learn a new motor skill with one hand, this process results in performance improvements in the opposite hand as well [3-6]. Despite the obvious adaptive advantage of such intermanual transfer, there is no direct evidence identifying the neural substrates of this form of skill acquisition [7-9]. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain regions activated during intermanual transfer of a learned sequence of finger movements. First, we found that the supplementary motor area (SMA) has more activity when a skill has transferred well than when it has transferred poorly. Second, we found that fMRI activity in the ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus correlated with successful future intermanual transfer, whereas activity in the ventrolateral anterior thalamic nucleus correlated with past intermanual transfer. Third, we found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the SMA blocked intermanual transfer without affecting skill acquisition. These findings provide direct evidence for an SMA-based mechanism that supports intermanual transfer of motor-skill learning.","NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect & Stroke, Neurorehabil Clin, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); University of Virginia","Cohen, LG (corresponding author), NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect & Stroke, Neurorehabil Clin, NIH, 10 Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","cohenl@ninds.nih.gov",,"Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907","Intramural NIH HHS Funding Source: Medline","Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)",,,34,106,107,0,17,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0960-9822",,,"CURR BIOL","Curr.

The pOFC also sends a uniquely one-way excitatory pathway to the amygdalar inhibitory intercalated masses (IM), which inhibit the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus (CeM). Inhibition of IM has the opposite effect, allowing amygdalar activation of autonomic structures and emotional arousal. Using multiple labeling approaches to identify pathways and their postsynaptic sites in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, we found that the anterior cingulate cortex innervated mostly the basolateral and CeM amygdalar nuclei, poised to activate CeM for autonomic arousal. By contrast, a pathway from pOFC to IM exceeded all other pathways to the amygdala by density and size and proportion of large and efficient terminals. Moreover, whereas pOFC terminals in IM innervated each of the three distinct classes of inhibitory neurons, most targeted neurons expressing dopamine-and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+), known to be modulated by dopamine. The predominant pOFC innervation of DARPP-32+ neurons suggests activation of IM and inhibition of CeM, resulting in modulated autonomic function. By contrast, inhibition of DARPP-32 neurons in IM by high dopamine levels disinhibits CeM and triggers autonomic arousal. The findings provide a mechanism to help explain how a strong pOFC pathway, which is poised to moderate activity of CeM, through IM, can be undermined by the high level of dopamine during stress, resulting in collapse of potent inhibitory mechanisms in the amygdala and heightened autonomic drive, as seen in chronic anxiety disorders.","[Zikopoulos, Basilis] Boston Univ, Human Syst Neurosci Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [John, Yohan] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zikopoulos, Basilis; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Hoistad, Malin] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Med Management Ctr, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","Boston University; Boston University; Boston University; Karolinska Institutet","Barbas, X (corresponding author), Boston Univ, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu","Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012; John, Yohan/AAJ-2514-2020; John, Yohan/Q-6854-2019","John, Yohan/0000-0001-7018-2995; Hoistad, Malin/0000-0002-2312-3885; Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832","NIH grant from NIMH; NIH grant from NINDS","NIH grant from NIMH; NIH grant from NINDS","This work was supported by NIH grants from NIMH and NINDS.

Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as templates for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.","[Falahpour, Maryam; Wong, Chi Wah; Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Funct MRI, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0677, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Radiol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chang, Catie] NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA","Falahpour, M; Liu, TT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Funct MRI, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0677, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","mfalahpour@ucsd.edu; catie.chang@nih.gov; cwwong@ieee.org; ttliu@ucsd.edu","Wong, Chi Wah/AAQ-6381-2021","Wong, Chi Wah/0000-0002-2833-979X; Liu, Thomas/0000-0002-1978-7486","NIH [R21MH112155]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This work was supported in part by NIH grant R21MH112155.",,51,40,40,0,12,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1053-8119","1095-9572",,"NEUROIMAGE","Neuroimage","JUL 1",2018,174,,,,,,317,327,,"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.012","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.012"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.012"")",,,11,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","GM9XK",29548849,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000438609100028","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000438609100028"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Indeed, in vitro, the molecule displays high selectivity at mGlu(2) receptors. However, PET experiments performed in rats, macaques and humans, have suggested that [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 could interact with an unidentified, non-mGlu(2) receptor binding site. The brain distribution of [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 has not been determined in the brain of the common marmoset, a small non-human primate increasingly used in neuroscience research. Here, we investigated the distribution of [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 in the marmoset brain. Three marmosets underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 90-min dynamic PET scans with [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 in combination with vehicle or the mGlu(2) PAM AZD8529 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg). In the scans in which [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 was co-administered with vehicle, the brain areas with the highest standardised uptake values (SUVs) were the midbrain, cerebellum and thalamus, while the lowest SUVs were found in the pons. The addition of AZD8529 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) to [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 did not modify the SUVs obtained with [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 alone, and ex vivo blocking autoradiography with PAM AZD8529 (10, 100, 300 mu M) on marmoset brain sections showed increased signals in the blocking conditions compared to vehicle, suggesting that no competition occurred between the 2 ligands.

Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure responses in the human LGN and SC during sustained spatial attention. Subjects covertly and continuously tracked one of two segments that rotated through the visual field, composed of either moving dots or transient colored shapes. Activity in both nuclei was generally enhanced by attention, independent of the stimulus type, with the voxels responding more sensitively to stimulus contrast ( those dominated by magnocellular input) exhibiting greater attentional enhancement. The LGN contained clusters of voxels exhibiting attentional enhancement or weak suppression, whereas the SC exhibited predominantly attentional enhancement, which was significantly stronger than in the LGN. The spatial distribution of the attentional effects was unrelated to the retinotopic organization in either structure. The results demonstrate that each of the major subcortical visual pathways participates in attentional selection, and their differential magnitudes of modulation suggest distinct roles.","[Schneider, Keith A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Rochester Ctr Brain Imaging, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA","Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Rochester; University of Rochester","Schneider, KA (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, 210 McAlester Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.","schneiderkei@missouri.edu",,"Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X; Schneider, Keith/0000-0001-7120-3380","National Institutes of Health [2R01 MH64043, 1R01 EY017699, 2P50 MH62196, T32 MH065214]; National Science Foundation [BCS-0633281.]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants 2R01 MH64043, 1R01 EY017699, 2P50 MH62196, and T32 MH065214, and National Science Foundation Grant BCS-0633281.",,45,86,86,1,9,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

We used retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to label second-order neurons that send information to the FEF of cebus monkeys. The saccade region of the FEF was identified physiologically using intracortical stimulation and then injected with a strain of HSV-1 known to be transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. Retrograde transport of virus labeled neurons was observed in all the thalamic sites known to innervate the FEF. In addition, we found neurons labeled by transneuronal transport in three subcortical sites: the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, the optic and intermediate gray layers of the superior colliculus, and a posterior portion of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. Each of these sites has been shown in prior studies to project to thalamic regions that innervate the FEF. Moreover, the neurons labeled through transneuronal transport were located in a subregion of each subcortical site that is known to be involved in oculomotor control. These observations demonstrate that signals from the substantia nigra, superior colliculus and dentate nucleus can have a significant influence on the output of the FEF.","UNIV MISSISSIPPI,MED CTR,DEPT OPHTHALMOL,JACKSON,MS 39216; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT NEUROSURG,SYRACUSE,NY 13210; VET ADM MED CTR,SYRACUSE,NY 13210; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT PHYSIOL,SYRACUSE,NY 13210","University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center","LYNCH, JC (corresponding author), UNIV MISSISSIPPI,MED CTR,DEPT ANAT,2500 N STATE ST,JACKSON,MS 39216, USA.",,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY4159] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS24328, NS2957] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,42,196,196,0,8,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Published studies of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) published between January 1, 2006 and March 1, 2018 comparing SCI patients with controls were collected by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Voxel-wise meta-analyses of GMV and WMV differences between SCI patients and controls were performed separately using seed-based d mapping. Twelve studies with 12 GMV data sets and 9 WMV data sets yielded a total of 466 individuals (190 SCI patients and 276 controls) who were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with controls, SCI patients showed GMV atrophy in sensorimotor system regions including the bilateral sensorimotor cortex (S1 and M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), paracentral gyrus, thalamus, and basal ganglia, as well as WMV loss in the corticospinal tract.GMV aberrancies were also demonstrated in brain regions responsible for cognition and emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the left insula. Additionally, GMV in both the bilateral S1 and the left SMA was positively correlated with the time span after the injury. In conclusion, anatomical atrophy in cortical-thalamic-spinal pathways suggested that SCIs may result in degenerative changes of the sensorimotor system. Further, OFC and insula GMV abnormalities may explain symptoms such as neuropathic pain and potential cognitive-emotional impairments in chronic SCI patients. These findings indicate that anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols could be neuroimaging biomarkers for interventional studies and treatments.","[Wang, Wenzhao; Chen, Jianan; Li, Hongfei; Su, Yanlin; Ning, Bin] Shandong Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenzhao] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shi] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Radiol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Cong] Shandong Univ, Qilu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Shandong University","Ning, B (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, 105 Jiefang Rd, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China.","ningbin@sdu.edu.cn","TANG, Shi/GXH-5719-2022","Wang, Wenzhao/0000-0001-5106-4862","National Natural Science Funds of China [81401014, 81771346]; Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561935, 2015T80725]","National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","We are grateful to Dr. Steven C.

IT(C) contains dorsal (ITCd) and ventral (ITCv) areas. The subcortical connections of these subdivisions of IT cortex were determined in the present study from the results of cortical injections of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, [H-3]-amino acids and fast blue. IT(C) and IT(R) receive afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral hypothalamus, paracentral nucleus, and central medial nucleus; send efferents to the superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, and striatum; and have both afferent and efferent connections with the pretectum, pulvinar, claustrum, amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert. IT(C) and IT(R) have different patterns of connections with a number of subcortical structures, including the pulvinar and amygdala. Injections in IT(C) strongly label multiple nuclei of the inferior pulvinar and the medial division of the lateral pulvinar (PL(M)), and moderately label the medial pulvinar (PM), whereas injections in IT(R) strongly label PM and moderately label PL(M). Injections in IT(C) label sparse projections to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, in contrast to injections in IT(R) that label strong projections to the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala. Injections in ''IT(I)'' produce a pattern of subcortical label that has some features of that observed from injections in IT(C) and that observed from injections in IT(R). Although most of the connections of ITCd and ITCv appear similar, only injections involving ITCd label the middle nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (Pl(M)). Comparison of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in squirrel monkeys and what is presently known of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in macaque monkeys supports the previous suggestion that IT(C) of squirrel monkeys may be comparable to area TEO of macaques, IT(I) may be comparable to posterior area TE, and IT(R) May be comparable to anterior area TE (Weller & Steele, 1992).","UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT PSYCHOL, UAB STN, BIRMINGHAM, AL 35294 USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham",,,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY07147] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [F31 MH10070] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,137,39,40,0,4,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0952-5238","1469-8714",,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","MAY-JUN",1993,10,3,,,,,563,583,,"10.1017/S0952523800004776","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800004776"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800004776"")",,,21,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","KY758",7684249,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993KY75800015","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993KY75800015"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Dextromethorphan (DM) is a widely used antitussive reported to exert anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. In this study, we examined the long-term effect of MDMA on the primate serotonergic system and the protective property of DM against MDMA-induced serotonergic abnormality using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were divided into three groups, namely control, MDMA and co-treatment (MDMA/DM). [I-123]-ADAM was used as the radioligand for serotonin transporters (SERT) in SPECT scans. SERT levels of the brain were evaluated and presented as the uptake ratios (URs) of [I-123]-ADAM in several regions of interest of the brain including midbrain, thalamus and striatum. We found that the URs of [I-123]-ADAM were significantly lower in the brains of MDMA than control group, indicating lower brain SERT levels in the MDMA-treated monkeys. This MDMA-induced decrease in brain SERT levels could persist for over four years. However, the loss of brain SERT levels was not observed in co-treatment group. These results suggest that DM may exert a protective effect against MDMA-induced serotonergic toxicity in the brains of the non-human primate.","[Ma, Kuo-Hsing; Liu, Tsung-Ta; Weng, Shao-Ju; Huang, Yuahn-Sieh; Sung, Chi-Chang; Hsu, Te-Hung] Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Biol & Anat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Fu F.] Natl Def Med Ctr, Grad Inst Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chueh, Sheau-Huei] Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Biochem, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liao, Mei-Hsiu; Chang, Kang-Wei] Inst Nucl Energy Res, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-Sheng] Taipei Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Cheng, Cheng-Yi] Tri Serv Gen Hosp, Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan","National Defense Medical Center; National Defense Medical Center; National Defense Medical Center; Institute of Nuclear Energy Research - Taiwan; Taipei Veterans General Hospital; National Defense Medical Center; Tri-Service General Hospital","Cheng, CY (corresponding author), Tri Serv Gen Hosp, Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan.","chengcy60@gmail.com",,"Chang, Kang-Wei/0000-0002-4476-3603","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 102-2623-E-016-005-NU, NSC 101-2623-E-016-002-NU, NSC 99-2314-B-016-030-MY3]; Ministry of Defense, Taiwan [MAB-104-060]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Ministry of Defense, Taiwan","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC 102-2623-E-016-005-NU, NSC 101-2623-E-016-002-NU and NSC 99-2314-B-016-030-MY3) and from Ministry of Defense (MAB-104-060), Taiwan.",,65,6,6,0,12,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322",,,"SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","DEC 12",2016,6,,,,,,,,38695,"10.1038/srep38695","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep38695"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep38695"")",,,8,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","EE5KQ",27941910,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000389646300001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000389646300001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Quantitative electron microscopy was carried out on the posteromedial barrel subfield of mouse somatosensory cortex from postnatal day 4 (P4) when thalamocortical innervation of the barrels is becoming established, through to sexual maturity (>P32), and in adulthood. Both asymmetrical (putatively excitatory) and symmetrical (putatively inhibitory) synapses were present in all layers from P4. The symmetrical synapses were immunoreactive for BABA at all ages, There was a progressive increase in both asymmetrical and symmetrical synapses up to P32, density in all layers increasing 16-fold, with the production of asymmetrical synapses leading and greatly outstripping that of symmetrical. From P32 to P120, the oldest age studied, synaptic numbers declined by 18% to 13 times the P4 level, but this affected predominantly layers II/III, IV and V, and mainly involved asymmetrical synapses. The relative percentage of asymmetrical to symmetrical synapses from P4 to P8 was 57%/43% but at P32 it was 89.5%/10.5% and in adulthood 85.4%/14.6%. These data indicate that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the rodent cortex begins earlier than previously thought, a basis for inhibition being present from the earliest period. Pruning of all synapses occurs well after thalamocortical innervation is established and inhibitory synapses are less affected by the pruning process.","UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717; CSIC,INST CAJAL,E-28002 MADRID,SPAIN; UNIV ALICANTE,INST NEUROCIENCIAS,SAN JUAN 03550,SPAIN","University of California System; University of California Irvine; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Cajal (IC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante (IN); Universitat d'Alacant",,,"DEFELIPE, JAVIER/D-1195-2014","DEFELIPE, JAVIER/0000-0001-5484-0660",,,,,67,206,209,0,7,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Therefore, the ability to accurately predict the precise locations of brain regions of interest (ROI) and to retrieve those areas as quickly as possible following the brain harvest is critical for Subsequent analyses. One way to achieve this objective is the utilization of high-resolution MRI to guide the subsequent dissections. In the present study, individual MRI images of the brains of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques that had chronically self-administered ethanol were employed in Order to determine which blocks of dissected tissue contained specific ROIs. MRI-guided brain dissection of discrete brain regions was completely accurate in 100% of the cases. In comparison, approximately 60-70% accuracy was achieved in dissections that relied on external landmarks alone without the aid of MRI. These results clearly demonstrate that the accuracy of targeting specific brain areas can be improved with high-resolution MR imaging. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

An accurate map of D-4 distribution and density in brain is essential to clarify the role of this receptor subtype in normal brain function and in neuropsychiatric disorders. We investigated the autoradiographic distribution of D-4 receptors in non-human primate (Macaca mulatta) brain (N = 3) with the novel Dq receptor probe [H-3]PNU-101958. Quantification of [H-3]PNU-101958 binding sites in 77 brain regions revealed dense levels of D-4 receptors in several cortical areas, especially in prefrontal cortex, uncus, hypothalamic median eminence, hippocampal formation, and distinct thalamic nuclei, but mere significantly lower in striatum. The results correspond tt ell with previous reports of brain distribution of D-4 receptors using other radiolabeled probes, and of D-4 mRNA localization (with some exceptions). Overall, this study reveals that [H-3]PNU-101958 binding sites in non-human primate brain appear to reflect D-4 dopamine receptor distribution. The significance of a dense localization of D-4 receptors in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and broad distribution in other brain areas, allows for investigation of the relationship of these receptors to specific neuropsychiatric disorders and effects produced by psychostimulants.

This study reports the implementation of a baboon model for blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies (1.5 x 1.5 x 4 mm resolution) on a clinical 3 T-MRI scanner. BOLD fMRI responses to hypercapnic (5% CO2) challenge, 10 Hz flicker visual, and vibrotactile somatosensory-motor stimulations were investigated in baboons anesthetized sequentially with isoflurane and ketamine. Hypercapnia evoked robust BOLD increases. Paralysis was determined to be necessary to achieve reproducible functional activations within and between subjects under our experimental conditions. With optimized anesthetic doses (0.8-1.0% isoflurane or 6-8 mg/kg/h ketamine) and adequate paralysis (vecuronium, 0.2 mg/kg), robust activations were detected in the visual (V), primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory, primary motor (M cortices), supplementary motor area (SMA), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and thalamus (Th). Data were tabulated for 11 trials under isoflurane and 10 trials under ketamine on 5 baboons. S1, S2, M, and V activations were detected in essentially all trials (90-100% of the time, except 82% for S2 under isoflurane and 70% for M under ketamine). LGN activations were detected 64-70% of the time under both anesthetics. SMA and Th activations were detected 36-45% of the time under isoflurane and 60% of the time under ketamine. BOLD percent changes among different structures were slightly higher under ketamine than isoflurane (0.75% versus 0.58% averaging all structures), but none was statistically different (P>0.05). This baboon model offers an opportunity to non-invasively image brain functions and dysfunctions in large non-human primates. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Most of it derives from brain activation studies with PET and fMRI conducted over the last decade. The patterns of activations and deactivations during caloric and galvanic vestibular stimulations in healthy subjects have been compared with those in patients with acute and chronic peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Major findings are the following: (1) In patients with vestibular neuritis the central vestibular system exhibits a spontaneous visual-vestibular activation-deactivation pattern similar to that described in healthy volunteers during unilateral vestibular stimulation. In the acute stage of the disease regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) increases in the multisensory vestibular cortical and subcortical areas, but simultaneously it significantly decreases in the visual and somatosensory cortex areas. (2) In patients with bilateral vestibular failure the activation-deactivation pattern during vestibular caloric stimulation shows a decrease of activations and deactivations. (3) Patients with lesions of the vestibular nuclei due to Wallenbergs syndrome show no activation or significantly reduced activation in the contralateral hemisphere during caloric irrigation of the ear ipsilateral to the lesioned side, but the activation pattern in the ipsilateral hemisphere appears normal. These findings indicate that there are bilateral ascending vestibular pathways from the vestibular nuclei to the vestibular cortex areas, and the contralateral tract crossing them is predominantly affected. (4) Patients with posterolateral thalamic infarctions exhibit significantly reduced activation of the multisensory vestibular cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere, if the ear ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion is stimulated. Activation of similar areas in the contralateral hemisphere is also diminished but to a lesser extent. These data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a vestibular gatekeeper. (5) In patients with vestibulocerebellar lesions due to a bilateral floccular deficiency, which causes downbeat nystagmus (DBN), PET scans reveal that rCGM is reduced in the region of the cerebellar tonsil and flocculus/paraflocculus bilaterally. Treatment with 4-aminopyridine lessens this hypometabolism and significantly improves DBN. These findings support the hypothesis that the (para-) flocculus and tonsil play a crucial role in DBN. Although we can now for the first time attribute particular activations and deactivations to functional deficits in distinct vestibular disorders, the complex puzzle of the various multisensory and sensorimotor functions of the phylogenetically ancient vestibular system is only slowly being unraveled.","[Dieterich, Marianne] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Brandt, Thomas] Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich","Dieterich, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.","dieterich@neurologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de",,,"German Research Foundation [Di 379/4-3/4, Br 639/6-3/4]; BMBF [01GW0642]","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","We are grateful to Judy Benson for critically reading the manuscript.

Unfortunately, a complete within-subject mapping of commissural projections in humans has been limited due to the inability of typical imaging methods to detect lateral projections in posterior cortical regions. Here, we set out to map callosal projection connectivity, at the single subject level (N=6), by combining high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging and a novel multi-stage, region-of-interest (ROI) based fiber tracking approach. With these methods we were able to obtain a consistent increase in coverage of lateral projections to posterior cortical regions. Using 70 automatically segmented ROIs in each hemisphere and permutation statistics, we characterized significant interhemispheric connectivity patterns within each subject and observed: (1) consistent projections to frontal, parietal and occipital, but not temporal, areas, (2) a greater relative proportion of homotopic than heterotopic connections, and (3) commissural projections to the basal ganglia and thalamus that are consistent with human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomical literature. These results illustrate the first full connectivity analysis of the human corpus callosum, revealing several patterns consistent with histological findings in the nonhuman primate.

Of the commonly identified central structures, only the anterior cingulate cortex shows a consistent response during the experience of pain. The insula and thalamus demonstrate reasonable consistency while all other regions, including the lentiform nucleus, somatosensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, are active in no more than half the current studies. The reason for such discrepancy is likely to be due in part to methodological variability and in part to individual variability. One aspect of the methodology which is likely to contribute is the stimulus intensity. Studies vary considerably regarding the intensity of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli delivered. This is likely to produce varying activation of central structures coding for the intensity, affective and cognitive components of pain. Using twelve healthy volunteers and positron emission tomography (PET), the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to four intensities of stimulation were recorded. The stimulation was delivered by a CO2 laser and was described subjectively as either warm (not painful), pain threshold (just painful), mildly painful or moderately painful. The following group subtractions were made to examine the changing cerebral responses as the stimulus intensity increased: (1) just painful - warm; (2) mild pain - warm; and (3) moderate pain - warm. In addition, rCBF changes were correlated with the subjective stimulus ratings. The results for comparison '1' indicated activity in the contralateral prefrontal (area 10/46/44), bilateral inferior parietal (area 40) and ipsilateral premotor cortices (area 6), possibly reflecting initial orientation and plans for movement. The latter comparisons and correlation analysis indicated a wide range of active regions including bilateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and premotor cortices and thalamic responses, contralateral hippocampus, insula and primary somatosensory cortex and ipsilateral perigenual cingulate cortex (area 24) and medial frontal cortex (area 32). Decreased rCBF was observed in the amygdala region. These responses were interpreted with respect to their contribution to the multidimensional aspects of pain including fear avoidance, affect, sensation and motivation or motor initiation. It is suggested that future studies examine the precise roles of each particular region during the central processing of pain. (C) 1997 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Caudal lateral prefrontal areas (areas 8 and 46) receive projections from cortices representing early stages in visual or auditory processing, and from intraparietal and posterior cingulate areas associated with oculomotor guidance and attentional processes. Cortical input to areas 46 and 8 is complemented by projections from the thalamic multiform and parvicellular sectors of the mediodorsal nucleus associated with oculomotor functions and working memory. In contrast, caudal orbitofrontal areas receive diverse input from cortices representing late stages of processing within every unimodal sensory cortical system. In addition, orbitofrontal and caudal medial(limbic) prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the amygdala, associated with emotional memory, and from medial temporal and thalamic structures associated with long-term memory. Prefrontal cortices are linked with motor control structures related to their specific roles in central executive functions. Caudal lateral prefrontal areas project to brainstem oculomotor structures, and are connected with premotor cortices effecting head, limb and body movements. In contrast, medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal limbic cortices project to hypothalamic visceromotor centers for the expression of emotions. Lateral, orbitofrontal, and medial prefrontal cortices are robustly interconnected, suggesting that they participate in concert in central executive functions. Prefrontal limbic cortices issue widespread projections through their deep layers and terminate in the upper layers of lateral (eulaminate) cortices, suggesting a predominant role in feedback communication. In contrast, when lateral prefrontal cortices communicate with limbic areas they issue projections from their upper layers and their axons terminate in the deep layers, suggesting a role in feedforward communication. Through their widespread connections, prefrontal limbic cortices may exercise a tonic influence on lateral prefrontal cortices, inextricably linking areas associated with cognitive and emotional processes. The integration of cognitive, mnemonic and emotional processes is likely to be disrupted in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases which preferentially affect limbic cortices and consequently disconnect major feedback pathways to the neuraxis, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.","Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu",,"Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832",,,,,182,451,465,1,54,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0361-9230","1873-2747",,"BRAIN RES BULL","Brain Res.

VGLUT2 is localized in the cortical terminals of neuronal somas located in the main sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Thus, immunolabeling of cortex with antibodies to VGLUT2 can reveal geniculostriate terminal distributions in species in which connectivity cannot be studied with tract-tracing techniques, permitting broader comparative studies of cortical specializations. Here, we used VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry to compare the organization of geniculostriate afferents in primary visual cortex in hominid primates (humans, chimpanzees, and an orangutan), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaques and vervets), and New World monkeys (squirrel monkeys). The New and Old World monkeys had a broad, dense band of terminal-like labeling in cortical layer 4C, a narrow band of labeling in layer 4A, and additional labeling in layers 2/3 and 6, consistent with results from conventional tract-tracing studies in these species. By contrast, although the hominid primates had a prominent layer 4C band, labeling of layer 4A was sparse or absent. Labeling was also present in layers 2/3 and 6, although labeling of layer 6 was weaker in hominids and possibly more individually variable than in Old and New World monkeys. These findings are consistent with previous observations from cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and a very small number of connectivity studies, suggesting that the projections from the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4A were strongly reduced or eliminated in humans and apes following their evolutionary divergence from the other anthropoid primates.

Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.","[Schaffer, Evan S.; Miller, Kenneth D.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Schaffer, Evan S.; Miller, Kenneth D.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ozeki, Hirofumi; Finn, Ian M.; Ferster, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Columbia University; Columbia University; Northwestern University","Miller, KD (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.","ken@neurotheory.columbia.edu; ferster@northwestern.edu",,"Schaffer, Evan/0000-0002-8731-4939","National Institutes of Health [R01 EY04726, R01 EY11001]; JSPS","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We thank N.

Our immediate aim was to explore the inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to orientation selectivity, perhaps the most dramatic response property to emerge across the thalamocortical synapse. The broader goal was to understand how inhibitory circuits operate. Using whole-cell recording in cats in vivo, we found that layer 4 contains two populations of inhibitory cells defined by receptive field class-simple and complex. The simple cells were selective for stimulus orientation, whereas the complex cells were not. Our observations help to explain how neurons become sensitive to stimulus orientation and maintain that selectivity as stimulus contrast changes.

The [F-18]fluoroethylated analogs of SA4503 and SA5845 ([F-18]FE-SA4503 and [F-18]FE-SA5845) were evaluated in conscious monkeys to estimate its suitability for human application for PET. Conscious monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) were either scanned with [F-18]FE-SA4503 or [F-18]FE-SA5845 (n = 3 for both groups, 220 - 802 MBq). After a dynamic study of 120 min, radioactivity was displaced by intravenous (i.v.) injection of haloperidol (1 mg/kg). One month later the same set of three monkeys were scanned with [F-18]FE-SA4503 for 120 min and cold SA4503 (1 mg/kg) was infused to displace the radioactivity, and the other three monkeys were pretreated with haloperidol (1 mg/kg) before the 120-min PET-scan with [F-18]FE-SA5845. Cortical areas (cingulate, frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal), striatum, and thalamus showed high radioactivity uptake. Infusion of haloperidol displaced the radioactivity levels of the two radioligands. The same effect was found for [18F]FE-SA4503 after SA4503 displacement. Pretreatment with haloperidol blocked the [F-18]FE-SA5845 binding to give PET-images with low and uniform uptake in the brain. The findings demonstrated the reversible binding of the two radioligands. Metabolite analysis showed that 14% and 23% parent compound of [F-18]FE-SA5845 and [F-18]FE-SA4503, respectively, at 120 min postinjection was present in plasma. Kinetic analysis showed that the binding potential of [F-18]FE-SA5845 was higher in all brain regions than that of [F-18]FE-SA4503 (4.75-8.79 vs. 1.65-4.04).

As brain atlases are essential tools for brain investigation, the objective of the current work was to create the first 3D digital atlas of the mouse lemur brain. For this, a template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, we generated probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and probability maps, as well as imaging tools used to create and manipulate the template, can all be freely downloaded. The atlas was first used to automatically assess regional age-associated cerebral atrophy in a cohort of mouse lemurs previously studied by voxel based morphometry (VBM). Results based on the atlas were in good agreement with the VBM ones, showing age-associated atrophy in the same brain regions such as the insular, parietal or occipital cortices as well as the thalamus or hypothalamus. The atlas was also used as a tool for comparative neuroanatomy. To begin with, we compared measurements of brain regions in our MRI data with histology-based measures from a reference article largely used in previous comparative neuroanatomy studies. We found large discrepancies between our MRI-based data and those of the reference histology-based article. Next, regional brain volumes were compared amongst the mouse lemur and several other mammalian species where high quality volumetric MRI brain atlases were available, including rodents (mouse, rat) and primates (marmoset, macaque, and human). Unlike those based on histological atlases, measures from MRI atlases indicated similar cortical to cerebral volume indices in all primates, including in mouse lemurs, and lower values in mice. On the other hand, white matter to cerebral volume index increased from rodents to small primates (mouse lemurs and marmosets) to macaque, reaching their highest values in humans.","[Nadkarni, Nachiket A.; Bougacha, Salma; Garin, Clement; Dhenain, Marc; Picq, Jean-Luc] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, UMR 9199,Neurodegenerat Dis Lab, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Nadkarni, Nachiket A.; Bougacha, Salma; Garin, Clement; Dhenain, Marc; Picq, Jean-Luc] Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat CEA, DRF, Inst Francois Jacob, MIRCen, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Bougacha, Salma] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, UMR S U1237,GIP Cyceron, Caen, France; [Bougacha, Salma] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Neuropsychol & Imagerie Memoire Humaine, EPHE,INSERM,U1077,CHU Caen, F-14000 Caen, France; [Picq, Jean-Luc] Univ Paris 08, Lab Psychopathol & Neuropsychol, EA 2027, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93000 St Denis, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Caen Normandie; CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite Paris-VIII","Dhenain, M (corresponding author), CEA, CNRS, UMR 9199, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France.","marc.dhenain@cea.fr","Dhenain, Marc/K-5630-2013; Garin, Clement M./AAS-3862-2021","Dhenain, Marc/0000-0001-8804-4101; Garin, Clement M./0000-0003-0712-7330","France-Alzheimer Association; Plan Alzheimer Foundation; French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program","France-Alzheimer Association; Plan Alzheimer Foundation; French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program","We thank the France-Alzheimer Association, Plan Alzheimer Foundation and the French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program for funding this study.",,44,15,15,0,22,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1053-8119","1095-9572",,"NEUROIMAGE","Neuroimage","JAN 15",2019,185,,,,,,85,95,,"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.010","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.010"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.010"")",,,11,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","HC2JN",30326295,"Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000451628200008","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000451628200008"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Parabrachiofugal fibers ascended to the forebrain along three pathways: the central tegmental tract, the ventral ascending catecholaminergic pathway, and a pathway located on the midline between the medial longitudinal fasciculi. The PBN projected heavily to the central nucleus of the amygdala and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and moderately to the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra. Light terminal label also was present within the dorsomedial, ventromedial, lateral, supramammillary, and infundibular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the annular nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus within the brain stem. The overall pattern. of terminal label was similar to that previously reported for nonprimate species, but several differences were notable. In monkey the projection to the ventrobasal thalamus did not coincide with the region that contains gustatory-responsive neurons. In rats, these parabrachiothalamic fibers convey gustatory activity but in the monkey these fibers may carry visceral afferent information. The projections from the PBN to the hypothalamus in the monkey were neither as widespread nor as intense as in the rat, and the monkey lacks a projection from the PBN to the frontal and insular cortices, (C) 2000 Academic Press.","Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Behav Sci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health","Pritchard, TC (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Behav Sci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",,,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC00246] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH00653] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,143,78,79,0,5,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","0014-4886","1090-2430",,"EXP NEUROL","Exp.

Whether the claustrum has closer affinities with the cortex or the striatum has been debated for many decades. Our observation of histological sections from primate brains and genomic data in the mouse suggest former. Given this, the present study compares the connections of the two structures in Micro-cebus using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI, with 72 directions), with a very small voxel size (90 micra), and probabilistic fiber tractography. High angular and spatial resolution diffusion imaging is non-destructive, requires no surgical interventions, and the connection of each and every voxel can be mapped, whereas in conventional tract tracer studies only a few specific injection sites can be assayed. Our data indicate that despite the high genetic and spatial affinities between the two structures, their connectivity patterns are very different. The claustrum connects with many cortical areas and the olfactory bulb; its strongest probabilistic connections are with the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that the claustrum may have a role in spatial memory and navigation. By contrast, the insula connects with many subcortical areas, including the brainstem and thalamic structures involved in taste and visceral feelings. Overall, the connections of the Microcebus claustrum and insula are similar to those of the rodents, cat, macaque, and human, validating our results. The insula in the Microcebus connects with the dorsolateral frontal cortex in contrast to the mouse insula, which has stronger connections with the ventromedial frontal lobe, yet this is consistent with the dorsolateral expansion of the frontal cortex in primates. In addition to revealing the connectivity patterns of the Microcebus brain, our study demonstrates that HARDI, at high resolutions, can be a valuable tool for mapping fiber pathways for multiple sites in fixed brains in rare and difficult-to-obtain species.","[Park, Soyoung; Tyszka, J.

Recent studies have suggested that parkinsonism is closely associated with increased amplitude and duration of beta burst activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). How beta burst dynamics are altered from the normal to parkinsonian state across the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) motor network, however, remains unclear. In this study, we simultaneously recorded local field potential activity from the STN, internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and primary motor cortex (M1) in three female rhesus macaques, and characterized how beta burst activity changed as the animals transitioned from normal to progressively more severe parkinsonian states. Parkinsonism was associated with an increased incidence of beta bursts with longer duration and higher amplitude in the low beta band (8-20 Hz) in both the STN and GPi, but not in M1. We observed greater concurrence of beta burst activity, however, across all recording sites (M1, STN, and GPi) in PD. The simultaneous presence of low beta burst activity across multiple nodes of the BGTC network that increased with severity of PD motor signs provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that low beta synchronized oscillations play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of PD. Given its immersion throughout the motor circuit, we hypothesize that this elevated beta-band activity interferes with spatial-temporal processing of information flow in the BGTC network that contributes to the impairment of motor function in PD.","[Yu, Ying; Sanabria, David Escobar; Wang, Jing; Hendrix, Claudia M.; Zhang, Jianyu; Nebeck, Shane D.; Amundson, Alexia M.; Busby, Zachary B.; Bauer, Devyn L.; Johnson, Luke A.; Vitek, Jerrold L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Vitek, JL (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.","vitek004@umn.edu",,"Wang, Jing/0000-0002-9883-4972; Bauer, Devyn/0000-0003-3414-411X; Yu, Ying/0000-0002-5693-0755; Johnson, Luke/0000-0002-9069-1436","NINDS NIH HHS [P50 NS098573, R37 NS077657, R01 NS058945, R01 NS110613, R01 NS117822, R01 NS037019] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,68,12,12,0,6,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","1529-2401",,"J NEUROSCI","J.

There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.","[Ferster, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Priebe, Nicholas J.] Univ Texas Austin, Neurobiol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Northwestern University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Ferster, D (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, 2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","ferster@northwestern.edu",,,,,,,148,252,253,6,39,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0896-6273","1097-4199",,"NEURON","Neuron","FEB 28",2008,57,4,,,,,482,497,,"10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.005","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.005"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.005"")",,,16,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","270EQ",18304479,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000253703600004","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000253703600004"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We manipulated lateral pulvinar neural activity in prosimian primates and assessed the effect on supra-granular layers of V1 that project to higher visual cortex. Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields fourfold and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields toward the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations. Excitation of lateral pulvinar after LGN lesion activated supra-granular layer V1 neurons.

Extracellular cell activity during saccades, saccade-like image shifts, and various stationary visual stimuli was recorded together with the animals' eye positions. All neurons analyzed had receptive fields that covered most of the central 80x80 degrees of the animals' visual field and did only respond to large (>20 degrees) visual stimuli. According to their response properties, recorded neurons were divided into three populations. The first group, termed S neurons (16%), responded when the animals performed saccades but were unresponsive to any of the visual stimuli tested. These neurons do not seem to receive a visual input that is strong enough to drive them. The second group, termed V neurons (51%), responded to various visual stimuli including saccade-like image motion when the eyes were stationary, but not when the animals executed saccades. V neurons therefore distinguish retinal image movements that are generated externally from internally generated image motion. Finally, SV neurons (31%) responded when the animals made saccades as well as to saccade-like image motion or to stationary stimuli. Although these neurons do not distinguish self-induced retinal image motion from motion generated by external stimulus movements, they must receive non-retinal motion-related input, because responses elicited by saccades had shorter latencies than responses to saccade-like stimulus movements. Only SV neurons resemble response properties of pretectal neurons that project to the pulvinar and that comprise the major subcortical visual input. The functional significance of pulvinar neuronal populations for visual and visuomotor information processing is discussed.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum","Schmidt, M (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.","mschmidt@neurobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de",,,,,,,41,9,9,0,0,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Pioneering studies on perceptual suppression (PS) described specific local neural network responses in primary visual cortex, thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex of the macaque brain. Yet the neural effects of PS have rarely been studied with intracerebral recordings outside these cortices and simultaneously across distant brain areas. Here, we combined (1) a novel experimental paradigm in which we produced a similar perceptual disappearance and also re-appearance by using visual adaptation with transient contrast changes, with (2) electrophysiological observations from human intracranial electrodes sampling wide brain areas. We focused on broadband high-frequency (50-150 Hz, i.e., gamma) and low-frequency (8-24 Hz) neural activity amplitude modulations related to target visibility and invisibility. We report that low-frequency amplitude modulations reflected stimulus visibility in a larger ensemble of recording sites as compared to broadband gamma responses, across distinct brain regions including occipital, temporal and frontal cortices. Moreover, the dynamics of the broadband gamma response distinguished stimulus visibility from stimulus invisibility earlier in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus than in temporal regions, suggesting a possible role of fronto-insular cortices in top down processing for conscious perception. Finally, we report that in primary visual cortex only low-frequency amplitude modulations correlated directly with perceptual status. Interestingly, in this sensory area broadband gamma was not modulated during PS but became positively modulated after 300 ms when stimuli were rendered visible again, suggesting that local networks could be ignited by top down influences during conscious perception.","[Vidal, Juan R.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe] INSERM, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Brain Dynam & Cognit Team, U1028,CNRS,UMR5292, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lyon 1, F-69365 Lyon, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela] CNRS, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, UMR 5105, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Kahane, Philippe] CHU Grenoble, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Kahane, Philippe] INSERM, Dept Neurol, U704, F-38043 Grenoble, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; CHU Grenoble Alpes; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)","Vidal, JR (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Pierre Mendes France, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, CNRS,UMR 5105, Batiment Sci Homme & Math BP 47, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France.","juan.vidal@upmf-grenoble.fr","Vidal, Juan R/C-7291-2016; KAHANE, PHILIPPE/P-5669-2016; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe/K-1681-2017","Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela/0000-0001-9981-7042",,,,,102,12,12,1,17,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078",,,"FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

While amnestic AD is characterized by disrupted default mode network (DMN) connectivity with corresponding increases in salience network (SN) connectivity, a visuospatial network appears to be disrupted early in PCA. Based on PCA patients' clinical features, we hypothesized that, in addition to early decreased integrity within the visuospatial network, patients with PCA would show increases in SN connectivity despite relative preservation of DMN. As the lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus has direct anatomical connections with striate and extrastriate cortex and DMN, and the medial pulvinar is anatomically interconnected with SN, we further hypothesized that lateral and medial pulvinar nuclei might be implicated in intrinsic connectivity changes in PCA. Methods: 26 patients with PCA and 64 matched controls were recruited through UCSF Memory and Aging Center research programs. Each completed a standardized neuropsychological battery, structural MRI, and task-free fMRI. Seed-based functional correlations were used to probe networks of interest, including those seeded by the medial and lateral pulvinar thalamic nuclei, across the whole brain, and functional data analyses were adjusted for brain atrophy. Results: Patients with PCA showed disproportionate deficits in the visuospatial domain; they also showed preserved social sensitivity and endorsed more depressive symptoms than HCs. PCA patients had significant parietooccipital atrophy accompanied by widespread connectivity decreases within the visuospatial network, enhanced connectivity between some structures in SN, and enhanced connectivity between key nodes of the DMN compared to controls. Increased SN connectivity correlated with a measure of social sensitivity, and increased DMN connectivity correlated with short-term memory performance. Medial pulvinar connectivity increases in PCA were topographically similar to SN (anterior insula) connectivity increases, while lateral pulvinar connectivity increases were similar to DMN (posterior cingulate) connectivity increases. Conclusions: PCA is characterized by preserved to heightened connectivity in the SN and DMN despite decreased visuospatial network connectivity. The spatial similarity of medial and lateral pulvinar connectivity changes to those seen in the SN and DMN suggests a role for the pulvinar in intrinsic connectivity network changes in PCA.","[Fredericks, Carolyn A.; Brown, Jesse A.; Deng, Jersey; Kramer, Abigail; Ossenkoppele, Rik; Rankin, Katherine; Kramer, Joel H.; Miller, Bruce L.; Rabinovici, Gil D.; Seeley, William W.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Memory & Aging Ctr, 675 Nelson Rising Lane, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Fredericks, Carolyn A.] Stanford Ctr Memory Disorders, 213 Quarry Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA; [Ossenkoppele, Rik] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ossenkoppele, Rik] Alzheimer Ctr, Amsterdam Neurosci, Boelelaan 1117, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Fredericks, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Memory & Aging Ctr, 675 Nelson Rising Lane, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.;Fredericks, CA (corresponding author), Stanford Ctr Memory Disorders, 213 Quarry Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA.","cfrederi@stanford.edu; jesse.brown@ucsf.edu; abigail.kramer@ucsf.edu; r.ossenkoppele@vumc.nl; kate.rankin@ucsf.edu; joel.kramer@ucsf.edu; bruce.miller@ucsf.edu; gil.rabinovici@ucsf.edu; bill.seeley@ucsf.edu","Miller, Justin/AAG-8696-2021; Ossenkoppele, Rik/J-5826-2013; Rabinovici, Gil/AAA-2495-2020","Miller, Justin/0000-0002-5309-1570; Ossenkoppele, Rik/0000-0003-1584-7477; Miller, Bruce/0000-0002-2152-4220","National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, USA [P50-AG023501-14, P01-AG019724-16]; NIA [R01-AG045611]; American Academy of Neurology/American Brain Foundation Clinical Research Training Fellowship","National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, USA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); American Academy of Neurology/American Brain Foundation Clinical Research Training Fellowship","This work was supported in part by grants P50-AG023501-14 and P01-AG019724-16, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, USA (BLM), NIA R01-AG045611 (GDR), and by an American Academy of Neurology/American Brain Foundation Clinical Research Training Fellowship (CAF).",,61,12,12,0,4,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","2213-1582",,,"NEUROIMAGE-CLIN","NeuroImage-Clin.",,2019,21,,,,,,,,101628,"10.1016/j.nicl.2018.101628","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.101628"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.101628"")",,,9,"Neuroimaging","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","HN6ZP",30528957,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000460337700041","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000460337700041"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We review recent evidence suggesting that basal ganglia nuclei beyond the substantia nigra may also play a role in eye movements and the cognitive events leading up to the production of eye movements.

The development of this projection was compared to patterns of migration and settling of [H-3]-thymidine-labeled neurons destined for cortical layer IV, and to geniculocortical synapse formation. DiI-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in the intermediate zone beneath the lateral cerebral mantle at embryonic day (E)17 and in the subplate layer underlying visual cortex by E18. On E19 they appeared to accumulate and grow radially into an expanding subplate layer and into the deep part of developing cortical layer VI. By postnatal day (P)0, Dil or WGA-HRP-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in developing cortical layers VI and V. By P1, they invaded the deep portion of the cell-dense cortical plate, where they were in position to make initial contact with neurons that would later form layer IV. A few axons traversed the cortical plate to reach the marginal zone. Layer IV became an identifiable layer on P2, and a clear projection to layer IV was evident by P3. These results suggest that geniculocortical afferents grow continuously from the intermediate zone, initially into an expanding subplate layer and then sequentially into each of the developing cortical layers without evidence of ''waiting.'' Electron microscopic data suggest that geniculocortical axons begin to form immature synapses with dendrites and neuronal perikarya as they first encounter cortical neurons, first in the subplate layer and then in developing layers VI, V and marginal zone, in addition to the primary target layer IV. The precise targeting and overall temporal and laminar patterns of ingrowth and synaptogenesis suggest that geniculocortical axons are directed to the visual cortex by guidance cues within the internal capsule and subplate. Further, they reach the occipital pole early enough to influence the specification and histogenesis of cortical area 17, perhaps by exerting an influence on the deep-to-superficial ''wave'' of neuronal differentiation in sequentially developing subplate and cortical layers VI, V and IV.

We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined.

However, a systematic neuropathological analysis of the hippocampal formation and the thalamus in these rats is lacking. It is also unclear if reelin, a protein consistently associated with schizophrenia and potentially involved in the mechanism of action of MAM, participates in the neuropathological effects of this compound. Therefore, a thorough assessment including cytoarchitectural and neuromorphometric measurements of eleven brain regions was conducted. Numbers of reelin positive cells and reelin expression and methylation levels were also studied. Principal Findings: Compared to untreated rats, MAM-exposed animals showed a reduction in the volume of entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus associated with decreased neuronal soma. The entorhinal cortex also showed laminar disorganization and neuronal clusters. Reelin methylation in the hippocampus was decreased whereas reelin positive neurons and reelin expression were unchanged. Conclusions: Our results indicate that E17-MAM exposure reproduces findings from the hippocampal formation and the mediodorsal thalamus of patients with schizophrenia while providing little support for reelin's involvement. Moreover, these results strongly suggest MAM-treated animals have a diminished neuropil, which likely arises from abnormal neurite formation; this supports a recently proposed pathophysiological hypothesis for schizophrenia.","[Matricon, Julien; Bellon, Alfredo; Frieling, Helge; Kebir, Oussama; Le Pen, Gwenaelle; Jay, Therese M.; Krebs, Marie-Odile] Ctr Psychiat & Neurosci, INSERM, U894, Lab Physiopathol Malad Psychiat, Paris, France; [Beuvon, Frederic; Daumas-Duport, Catherine] Univ Paris 05, Fac Med Paris Descartes, Hop St Anne, Neuropathol Unit, Paris, France; [Frieling, Helge] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Socialpsychiat & Psychotherapy, D-3000 Hannover, Germany; [Beuvon, Frederic; Daumas-Duport, Catherine] Ctr Psychiat & Neurosci, INSERM, U894, Lab Plast Gliale & Tumeurs Cerebrales, Paris, France","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; GHU PARIS Psychiatrie Neurosciences; Hannover Medical School; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite","Matricon, J (corresponding author), Univ Auvergne, Lab Pharmacol Fondamentale & Clin, Fac Med, INSERM,UMR766, Clermont Ferrand, France.","alfredo.bellon@inserm.fr; marie-odile.krebs@inserm.fr","Krebs, Marie-Odile/O-2104-2017; Frieling, Helge/C-5299-2015; Jay, Therese M/G-2297-2015; LE PEN, Gwenaëlle/M-9974-2017","Krebs, Marie-Odile/0000-0002-4715-9890; Frieling, Helge/0000-0001-5146-9720; Jay, Therese M/0000-0002-2468-1141; LE PEN, Gwenaëlle/0000-0002-5405-8094; Jay, Therese/0000-0003-3553-9236","Action Thematique Concertee [ASE2128CSA]; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-05-NEUR-031-03]; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale [SPF20080511940]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [74641]; American Psychiatric Association","Action Thematique Concertee; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale(Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); American Psychiatric Association","This work was supported by Action Thematique Concertee (ASE2128CSA to J.M.); Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR-05-NEUR-031-03 PAIN to J.M.); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (SPF20080511940 to A.

These changes can be attributed to processes that are intrinsic to the cortex, or can be inherited from alterations occurring at stages of sensory processing that are antecedent to the primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual system, focal binocular retinal lesions initially silence an area of cortex that represents the region of retina destroyed, but over a period of months this area recovers visually driven activity. The retinotopic map in the recovered area is altered, shifting its representation to the portion of retina immediately surrounding the lesion. This effectively shrinks the representation of the lesioned area of retina, and expands the representation of the lesion surround. To determine the loci along the visual pathway at which the reorganization takes place, we compared the course of topographic alterations in the primary visual cortex and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats and monkeys, At a time when the cortical reorganization is complete, the silent area of LGN persists, indicating that changes in cortical topography are due to alterations that are intrinsic to the cortex. To explore the participation of thalamocortical afferents in the reorganization, we injected a series of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers into reorganized and surrounding cortex of each animal. Our results show that the thalamocortical arbors do not extend beyond their normal lateral territory and that this physical dimension is insufficient to account for the reorganization. We suggest that the long-range intrinsic horizontal connections are a likely source of visual input into the reorganized cortical area.","ROCKEFELLER UNIV, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA","Rockefeller University",,,,"Darian-Smith, Corinna/0000-0002-4753-4574",,,,,76,255,255,0,6,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Results were compared with expression patterns in adults. In the sensorimotor cortex at E125, overall levels of all subunit transcripts were low. At E137, there was a major lamina-specific increase in all subunit messenger RNAs except gamma(1). For alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(4), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(1) subunit transcripts, this increase was highest in areas 3a and 3b, particularly in layers III/IV and VI. Postnatally, there were significant decreases in all transcripts. alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) subunit transcripts, while still at significantly lower levels than at E137, remained expressed at levels higher than other transcripts. Unlike in rodents, there was no obvious switch in the major subunits expressed in fetal and adult cortex, alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) remaining highest throughout. In area 17, the most prominently expressed subunits at earliest ages were alpha(2), alpha(5), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(2), especially in layers II/III and VI. At E150, expression for alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(1) and beta(3) subunit transcripts in these layers decreased, but levels for alpha(1), alpha(4), alpha(5), beta(2), gamma(1) and gamma(2) transcripts increased, particularly within layer IV. The increase at E150 was particularly marked for alpha(5) transcripts, which were expressed at levels more than four times those of other transcripts. alpha(1), beta(2) and gamma(2) remain highest into aduthood. Fetal area 17 displayed lamina-specific patterns of expression not found in adult animals. In particular, alpha(3) messenger RNAs were present in layer IVA and gamma(1) transcripts were present in layer IVC at E150, despite a lack of expression in these layers in the adult. These data demonstrate increased expression of GABA(A) receptors during the period of establishment of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, and a temporal regulation that may be associated with the period of developmental plasticity.

Although each of these areas has a distinct structure and connections, they can be grouped into two networks, defined by cortico-cortical connections that primarily interconnect areas within each network. The networks also have different connections to the striatum, medial thalamus, and other brain regions. The orbital network consists of most of the areas In the orbital cortex. It receives several sensory inputs (olfactory, gustatory, visceral afferent, somatic sensory, and visual) that appear to be related to feeding. It also receives many limbic inputs from the amygdala, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and subiculum, including a specific projection from the ventrolateral part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. The orbital network may therefore serve as a substrate to integrate viscerosensory information with affective signals. The medial network consists of areas on the medial frontal surface together with a few select areas in the orbital cortex. These areas have few direct sensory inputs, and their limbic inputs are somewhat different than those to the orbital network (e.g., from the ventromedial part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus). However, they provide the major output from the OMPFC to the hypothalamus and brain stem (especially the periaqueductal gray). The medial network may therefore serve as visceromotor system to provide frontal cortical influence over autonomic and endocrine function. Connections between the networks presumably allow information now from viscerosensory to visceromotor systems. In addition to a probable role in eating behavior, this system appears to be involved in guiding behavior and regulation of mood.

(2) A set of projections extends from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and brain stem, which appears to modulate visceral function in relation to emotional stimuli.

The distribution of neuronal populations containing the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and parvalbumin, which are recognized markers for the GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex, is compared in five species of toothed whales and in representatives (one species each) of insectivores, bats, rodents, and primates. Computerized image analysis has shown that overall quantitative characteristics of GABAergic cortical neurons in toothed whales are similar to those in other mammalian orders. Thus, GABA-positive neurons represent 26% of the total population of cortical neurons in the visual cortex of whales. Some 97% of GABA-positive cells contain calcium-binding proteins, which is numerically similar to these parameters found in primates and other mammals. On the other hand, the typology and laminar distribution of calcium-binding protein-containing neurons in the primary visual cortex of five whale species (Delphinapterus leucas, Globicephala melaena, Phocoena phocoena, Stenella coeruleoalba, and Tursiops truncatus) differ significantly from those of primates (Macaca mulatta) and rodents (Rattus rattus) and are similar to those found in insectivorous bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). In whales, bats, and hedgehogs a significant concentration of calbindin-positive, vertically oriented bipolar and bitufted neurons was found in layers I, II, and IIIc/V with their axons arranged in a three-dimensional network. In primates and rodents they are distributed evenly across all cortical layers and are predominantly multipolar or bitufted neurons found in all cortical layers with their axons oriented along the vertical axis of the cortical plate. The parvalbumin-positive neurons in all mammalian species, including toothed whales, are represented by variously sized multipolar non-pyramidal cells. As opposed to all other mammalian species, the major concentrations of parvalbumin-positive neurons in whales are found in layers IIIc/V and VI, whereas in other cortical layers there are only scattered parvalbumin-positive neurons. Thus, in layers IIIc/V and VI calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neuronal populations form overlapping populations. In other mammalian species the parvalbumin-positive neurons are distributed more evenly between different cortical layers. The other prominent difference between mammalian orders was found in the quantitative relationships between calbindin-positive and parvalbumin-positive cortical neurons. Thus, the cortical calbindin-positive neuronal population is significantly (two to four times) higher relative to the parvalbumin-positive population of neurons in whales and evolutionary conservative mammals (bats and hedgehogs), whereas in phylogenetically progressive mammals (primates) and moderately progressive mammals (rodents) calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive populations are approximately equal in their relative concentrations. These data suggest that in cetacean primary visual cortex, as well as in primary cortices of prototypal terrestrial mammals, the calbindin-positive system of neurons is expressed considerably stronger than the parvalbumin system. These findings may relate to the absence or incipience (i.e., relatively poor development) of layer IV and hypertrophy of layers I and II in cetacean and prototypal mammalian sensory neocortices. This, in turn, suggests several important differences between prototypal and evolutionary progressive mammalian orders in the organization of neocortical afferentation. In whales and, to a lesser extent, in archetypal terrestrial mammals calbindin-positive nuclei of the thalamus may send strong calbindin-positive afferents to calbindin-rich superficial cortical layers as well as to limited mid-cortical layers, whereas parvalbumin-positive afferents from the thalamus may be reduced in view of the absence or incipience of layer IV.","CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL,NEW YORK,NY 10029; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV,NEW YORK,NY 10029; YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT OBSTET & GYNECOL,DIV NEUROSCI,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510; WORCESTER FDN EXPTL BIOL INC,NEUROBIOL LAB,SHREWSBURY,MA 01545","City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Yale University; Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research","GLEZER, II (corresponding author), CUNY,SCH MED,DEPT CELL BIOL & ANAT SCI,138 ST & CONVENT AVE,SCI BLDG,ROOM J-903,NEW YORK,NY 10031, USA.",,,,"NICHD NIH HHS [HD-23830, HD-06364] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-26068] Funding Source: Medline","NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,88,71,71,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

The idea that cognition and emotion are separable, antagonistic forces competing for dominance of mind has been hard to displace despite abundant evidence to the contrary. For instance, it is now known that a pathological absence of emotion leads to profound impairment of decision making. Behavioral observations of this kind are corroborated at the mechanistic level: neuroanatomical studies reveal that brain are as typically described as underlying either cognitive or emotional processes are linked in ways that imply complex interactions that do not resemble a simple mutual antagonism. Instead, physiological studies and network simulations suggest that top down signals from prefrontal cortexrealize cognitive control inpart by either suppressing or promoting emotional responses controlled by the a mygdala,in away that facilitates adaptation to changing task demands. Behavioral, anatomical, and physiological data suggest that emotion and cognition are equal partners in enabling a continuumor matrix offl exible behaviors that are sub served by multiple brain regions acting in concert.

We recorded the resting FMRI signal from 16 patients and 22 controls. We used seed-based functional correlation analyses to calculate partial correlations of all voxels in the hippocampus relative to characteristic regional signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while controlling for ventricular CSF and white matter signals. Group comparisons were carried out controlling for age, gender, hippocampal volume and brain volume. The strength of functional connectivity in each region also was correlated with neuropsychological measures. We found that the hippocampus can be segmented into three distinct functional subregions (head, body, and tail), according to the relative connectivity with PFC, PCC and thalamus, respectively. The AD group showed stronger hippocampus-PFC and weaker hippocampus-PCC functional connectivity, the magnitudes of which correlated with MMSE in both cases. The results are consistent with an adaptive role of the PFC in the context of progression of dysfunction in PCC during earlier stages of AD. Extension of our approach could integrate regional volume measures for the hippocampus with their functional connectivity patterns in ways that should increase sensitivity for assessment of AD onset and progression.

In LGN, staining was confined to layers 2, 3, and 5, that is, to the layers innervated by the intact ipsilateral pathway. Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of area 17 and layers 3 and 5 of area 18. The neuropil was stained in all layers of area 17, but more heavily in layers 1, 2, 4B, the bottom of 4C-beta, 5B, and 6B.

This banding pattern is consistent with the presence of NAAG in geniculocortical terminals of the intact ipsilateral pathway and the absence of such terminals for the contralateral pathway, which had undergone transneuronal degeneration due to the optic chiasm sectioning. Overall, our results for monkey are very similar to those in cat and suggest that NAAG or a structurally related molecule may have a prominent role in the communication of visual signals at retinal, thalamic, and cortical levels.","SUNY ALBANY, DEPT BIOL SCI, ALBANY, NY 12222 USA; GEORGETOWN UNIV, DEPT BIOL, WASHINGTON, DC 20057 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Georgetown University","TIEMAN, SB (corresponding author), SUNY ALBANY, NEUROBIOL RES CTR, ALBANY, NY 12222 USA.",,,,"NIDA NIH HHS [DA 02297] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH 34770] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,152,43,43,0,0,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of antimuscarinic agents, oxybutynin and imidafenacin, on temporal changes in cognitive function and central mAChR occupancy in conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatto). Three conscious monkeys underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11]( +)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre, and 1, 4, and 24 h post oral administration of oxybutynin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or imidafenacin (0.01-0.1 mg/kg). Maximum cognitive impairment was observed 1 h post-oxybutynin at oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, in a dose-dependent manner, and oxybutynin produced significant positive correlations between mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment in the cortices, thalamus, brainstem, and striatum. The most significant correlation was observed in the brainstem, and then cortices. In contrast, imidafenacin did not induce discernible cognitive impairment, despite having obtained some lesser occupancy in cortices and brainstem. We propose that the thresholds of mAChR occupancy to produce cognitive impairment by antimuscarinic agents are ca. 30-40% in cortices and ca. 20-30% in brainstem, and a desirable drug for OAB treatment should not occupy central mAChR above these thresholds.

The development of a pseudotyped lentiviral vector with the property of retrograde infection allows us to introduce foreign genes into neurons that are localized in regions innervating the site of vector injection. Here, we report the efficiency of retrograde gene transfer of a recently developed FuG-E pseudotyped lentiviral vector in the primate brain by comparing its transduction pattern with that of the parental FuG-C pseudotyped vector. After injection of the FuG-E vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum of macaque monkeys, many GFP-immunoreactive neurons were found in regions projecting to the striatum, such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Quantitative analysis revealed that in all regions, the number of neurons retrogradely transduced with the FuG-E vector was larger than in the FuG-C vector injection case. It was also confirmed that the FuG-E vector displayed explicit neuronal specificity to the same extent as the FuG-C vector. This vector might promote approaches to pathway-selective gene manipulation and provide a powerful tool for effective gene therapy trials against neurological disorders through enhanced retrograde delivery.

In an attempt to elucidate this problem, we investigated the role of canine auditory core and belt areas in auditory recognition. Either core or posterior belt areas were surgically removed. The core and belt regions were defined on the basis of response properties and thalamocortical connectivity established in previous studies. The animals were tested on auditory delayed matching to sample (DMS, a recognition memory task) using complex, trial-unique auditory stimuli. Both core and belt lesions impaired auditory recognition, however, the underlying deficit was different. Lesions to the core areas impaired auditory localization abilities. Lesions to the posterior belt areas did not affect this component of the recognition task, but affected auditory quality discrimination and/or recognition. The deficit following the posterior belt lesion did not increase with retention delay, suggesting that auditory belt areas do not constitute a substrate for auditory recognition memory.

Presumptive perirhinal or sensorimotor areas of the cerebral wall were removed as slabs from embryonic day 12 (E12), E13, or E14 rats and transplanted heterotopically into either rostral perirhinal or sensorimotor cortical areas of neonatal rats. Two weeks later, the afferent cortical connections of the grafts were labeled by placing DilC(18)-3 (Dil) into each transplant site. Both the E12 and E13 heterotopic transplants of presumptive perirhinal cortex contain mostly precursor cells. When these grafts are placed into sensorimotor cortex, callosal connections are formed primarily with the contralateral sensorimotor (Sml) area, the normal projection of Sml cortex. In contrast, the E14 heterotopic transplants of the perirhinal cortical wall, containing many more postmitotic neurons, developed contralateral connections with both sensorimotor and rostral perirhinal cortices. Thus, when precursor cells are transplanted heterotopically, by using E12/E13 donor tissue, the grafts receive projections that are similar to those of the host cortical area. When older cortical neurons, together with precursors, are transplanted into a heterotopic cortical area, by using E14 donor tissue, their cortical connections exhibit both host and original donor phenotypes. The data are consistent with our previous analysis of thalamocortical connections of grafts (Barbe and Levitt, 1992b) and suggest the existence of a cell-cell recognition system for thalamocortical and corticocortical circuit formation, whose mechanisms of action may be linked to the timing of neurogenesis.","UNIV MED & DENT NEW JERSEY,ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MED SCH,DEPT NEUROSCI & CELL BIOL,PISCATAWAY,NJ 08854","Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University Medical Center","BARBE, MF (corresponding author), TEMPLE UNIV,COLL ALLIED HLTH,DEPT PHYS THERAPY,3307 N BROAD ST,PHILADELPHIA,PA 19140, USA.",,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH45507] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,108,67,67,0,1,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that Occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected Current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.","[Lempka, Scott F.; Miocinovic, Svjetlana; Johnson, Matthew D.; McIntyre, Cameron C.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lempka, Scott F.; Miocinovic, Svjetlana; McIntyre, Cameron C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Vitek, Jerrold L.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA","Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Case Western Reserve University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation","McIntyre, CC (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Biomed Engn, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.","mcintyc@ccf.org","Johnson, Matthew D/B-6276-2015","Johnson, Matthew D/0000-0001-9686-5540; Miocinovic, Svjetlana/0000-0001-9237-0276","National Institutes of Health [R01 NS047388, R01 NS037019]; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in the Areas of National Need (GAANN)","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in the Areas of National Need (GAANN)(US Department of Education)","The authors would like to thank Justin Williams for his helpful discussion on in vivo EIS measurements and model analysis.

In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for >85% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina.","[Sincich, Lawrence C.; Horton, Jonathan C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Salk Institute","Sincich, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, 10 Koret Way, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.","sincichl@vision.ucsf.edu","Sharpee, Tatyana O/E-8663-2010","Sharpee, Tatyana/0000-0002-7483-5081; Horton, Jonathan/0000-0002-3952-435X","National Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-0712852]; National Eye Institute [EY10217, EY02162]; National Institute of Mental Health [MH068904]; Alfred P.

Both the magnocellular (M)- and the parvocellular (P)-cell populations scale allometrically with brain volume in primates, P cells with a significantly higher slope such that, for every increase in M neuron number, P neuron numbers more than double (ln scale; y=0.89x+2.42R(2)=0.664). In diurnal primates, the ratio of P to M cells was slightly but significantly higher than in nocturnal primates. For all mammals, including primates, LGN volume was unrelated to nocturnal or diurnal niche but showed marked differences in slope and intercept depending on taxonomic group. The allometric scaling of M and P cells can be related to the order of neurogenesis, with late-generated P cells increasing with positive allometry compared with the earlier-generated M cells. This developmental regularity links relative foveal representation to relative isocortex enlargement, which is also generated late. The small increase in the P/M cell ratio in diurnal primates may result from increased developmental neuron loss in the M-cell population as it competes for limited termination zones in primary visual cortex.

We have placed deposits of distinguishable fluorescent tracers at multiple restricted sites in CGp and have analyzed the distribution throughout the forebrain of neurons labeled by retrograde transport. Cortical projections to CGp arise (in approximately descending order of strength) from anterior cingulate cortex; prefrontal cortex and premotor areas including the frontal eye fields; visual areas including especially areas 7 and 20b; parahippocampal areas; insular cortex; somesthetic areas; and auditory areas. Corticocortical pathways are organized topographically with respect to the posterior-anterior axis in CGp. Projections from prefrontal cortex and other areas with complex (as opposed to sensory, motor, or limbic) functions are concentrated posteriorly; projections from visual and oculomotor areas are concentrated at an intermediate level; and projections from areas with somesthetic and somatomotor functions are concentrated anteriorly. Thalamic projections to CGp arise from the anterior nuclei (AD, AV, and AM), from restricted portions of the ventral complex (VAd, VAm, and VMP), from discrete sectors of the lateral complex (LD, LPs, and LPm), from the rostral crescent of intralaminar nuclei (CM, PC, and CL), and from the reuniens nucleus. Projections from AM, VAd, LD, and LPs are spatially ordered in the sense that more ventral thalamic neurons project to more anterior cortical sites. Projections from AV and AD are stronger at more posterior cortical sites but do not show other signs of topographic ordering. Projections from LPm, CM, PC, CL, and RE are diffuse. We conclude (1) that cortical afferents of CGp derive predominantly from neocortical areas including those with well established sensory and motor functions; (2) that limbic projections to CGp originate primarily in structures, including the hippocampus, which are associated with memory, as opposed to structures, including the amygdala, which are associated with emotional and instinctual behavior; and (3) that CGp contains subregions in which complex, ocular, or somatic afferents predominate.","NEI, SENSOR MOTOR RES LAB, BETHESDA, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)","OLSON, CR (corresponding author), UNIV MARYLAND, COLL DENT SURG, DEPT ANAT, BALTIMORE, MD 21201 USA.",,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [1 RO1 NS27287] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,86,58,58,0,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

How is information from the cortex transmitted to the periphery? We used two parallel approaches to map simultaneously multiple pathways to determine if hypothalamic autonomic centres are a key link for orbitofrontal areas and medial prefrontal areas, which have been associated with emotional processes, as well as low-level spinal and brainstem autonomic structures. The latter innervate peripheral autonomic organs, whose activity is markedly increased during emotional arousal. Results: We first determined if pathways linking the orbitofrontal cortex with the hypothalamus overlapped with projection neurons directed to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, with the aid of neural tracers injected in these disparate structures. We found that axons from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices converged in the hypothalamus with neurons projecting to brainstem and spinal autonomic centers, linking the highest with the lowest levels of the neuraxis. Using a parallel approach, we injected bidirectional tracers in the lateral hypothalamic area, an autonomic center, to label simultaneously cortical pathways leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axons projecting to low-level brainstem and spinal autonomic centers. We found densely distributed projection neurons in medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axonal terminations in several brainstem structures and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, which innervate peripheral autonomic organs. We then provided direct evidence that axons from medial prefrontal cortex synapse with hypothalamic neurons, terminating as large boutons, comparable in size to the highly efficient thalamocortical system. The interlinked orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal areas and hypothalamic autonomic centers were also connected with the amygdala. Conclusions: Descending pathways from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, which are also linked with the amygdala, provide the means for speedy influence of the prefrontal cortex on the autonomic system, in processes underlying appreciation and expression of emotions.","Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, NEPRC, Southborough, MA 01772 USA","Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu; sgsaha@bu.edu; REMPELCL@grinnell.edu; ttroy@med.unc.edu","anand, amit/A-7222-2009","Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832",,,,,69,266,272,0,3,"BMC","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","1471-2202",,,"BMC NEUROSCI","BMC Neurosci.","OCT 10",2003,4,,,,,,,,25,"10.1186/1471-2202-4-25","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-4-25"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-4-25"")",,,12,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","742YJ",14536022,"gold, Green Published",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000186545500001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000186545500001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results.

The distribution of the 5-HT-positive cells and the pattern of 5-HT innervation resembled those described in other mammalian species but several differences were also noticed. The nine B groups of DAHLSTROM and FUXE (1964) were observed, except for the B4 group which was not detected in the hedgehog. Neuron-like immunoreactive cells were also observed in brain regions located outside the brainstem reticular formation. Among the latter the olfactory tubercle and the thalamus have not been described to contain 5-HT cell bodies in other mammals. The number and the ''lateralization'' of 5-HT-positive neurons in areas outside the midline raphe were more limited than those described in the rodents and much more limited than in the carnivores and the primates. 5-HT-positive axons were unevenly distributed throughout the hedgehog's CNS. From all neocortical areas, which displayed the highest innervation density in the layer I, somatosensory and visual areas were the most heavily and lighty innervated ones respectively. Other regions of the forebrain exhibiting dense serotoninergic innervation were: olfactory cortex; olfactory tubercle, subiculum; lateral septal nucleus; striatum; claustrum; medial and basal amygdaloid nuclei. Dense serotoninergic innervation were also found to receive the following brainstem structures: lateral hypothalamic area; dorsal part of the suprachiasmatic nucleus; arcuate nucleus; median eminence; habenular nuclei; centromedian thalamic nucleus; ventral tegmental area; medial part of the substantia nigra; interpeduncular nucleus; locus coeruleus; cuneiform nucleus; motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve; facial nucleus; parabrachial nucleus; prepositus hypoglossi nucleus; medial subnucleus of the nucleus of the solitary tract; hypoglossal nucleus; dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

Two main aspects are elaborated. The first is the evolution of visual projections from the midbrain to the telencephalon, featuring the encephalization of visual functions. Associated to this, the progressive fusion of the two main visual systems (thalamofugal and tectofugal) in the mammalian telencephalon (striate and extrastriate cortex, respectively) is viewed in the context of increasing cortico-cortical connectivity in the evolution of the mammalian brain. In addition, the issue of a presumed homology between mammalian extrastriate cortex and reptilian anterior dorsal ventricular ridge (ADVR) is reviewed in some detail, and it is concluded that extrastriate cortex is a derived character of mammals while ADVR is a derived character of reptiles and birds. It is not likely that ADVR is ancestral to extrastriate cortex. The second aspect under analysis is the origin of the inverted (inside-out) lamination pattern of mammalian neocortex that differs from the outside-in pattern of reptilian cortex. Furthermore, mammals have developed a transient embryonic cell layer (the subplate zone) that serves as a waiting compartment for thalamic and cortico-cortical axons while their prospective target cells end their migration process to reach their finals positions. It is postulated that both, inverted lamination and the subplate zone arose in evolution as successive and complementary strategies to maximize synaptic contacts between thalamic afferents and the new cortical cell types (belonging to prospective granular and supragranular layers) that were being originated at that moment.",,,"ABOITIZ, F (corresponding author), UNIV CHILE,FAC MED,DEPT MORFOL EXPTL,INDEPENDENCIA 1027,CASILLA 70079,CORREO 7,SANTIAGO,CHILE.",,"Aboitiz, Francisco/A-1016-2008",,,,,,52,10,11,0,3,"CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE","EDINBURGH","JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND EH1 3AF","0306-9877",,,"MED HYPOTHESES","Med.

Here, we examine the role of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets.

The post-surgical in-life was restricted to 3 weeks in order to minimize immunotoxicity expected to arise from expression of GFP in antigen-presenting cells. Three main findings emerged from this work. First, the volume over which AAV9 expression was distributed (Ve) was substantially greater than the volume of distribution of MRI signal (Vd). This stands in contrast with Ve/Vd ratio of rAAV2, which is lower under similar conditions. Second, post-mortem analysis revealed expression of GFP in thalamic and cortical neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons projecting from substantia nigra pars compacta, indicating retrograde transport of AAV9. However, fibers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a region that receives projections from putamen, also stained for GFP, indicating anterograde transport of AAV9 as well. Finally, one hemisphere received a 10-fold lower dose of vector compared with the contralateral hemisphere (1.5 x 10(13) vg ml(-1)) and we observed a much stronger dose effect on anterograde-linked than on retrograde-linked structures. These data suggest that AAV9 can be axonally transported bi-directionally in the primate brain. This has obvious implications to the clinical developing of therapies for neurological disorders like Huntington's or Alzheimer's diseases.","[Green, F.; Samaranch, L.; Forsayeth, J.; Bankiewicz, K.

This paper explores these anatomic substrates, namely, the incorporation of the associative and paralimbic cerebral areas into the cerebrocerebellar circuitry in nonhuman primates. Using the novel information that has emerged concerning this system, proposed rules are derived and specific hypotheses offered concerning cerebellar function and the relationship between cerebellum and nonmotor behavior, as follow. (1) The associative and paralimbic incorporation into the cerebrocerebellar circuit is the anatomic underpinning of the cerebellar contribution to cognition and emotion. (2) There is topographic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions within the cerebellum. The archicerebellum, vermis, and fastigial nucleus are principally concerned with affective and autonomic regulation and emotionally relevant memory. The cerebellar hemispheres and dentate nucleus are concerned with executive, visual-spatial, language, and other mnemonic functions. (3) The convergence of inputs from multiple associative cerebral regions to common areas within the cerebellum facilitates cerebellar regulation of supramodal functions. (4) The cerebellar contribution to cognition is one of modulation rather than generation. Dysmetria of (or ataxic) thought and emotion are the clinical manifestations of a cerebellar lesion in the cognitive domain. (5) The cerebellum performs the same computations for associative and paralimbic functions as it does for the sensorimotor system. These proposed rules and the general and specific hypotheses offered in this paper are testable using functional neuroimaging techniques. Neuroanatomy and functional neuroimaging may thus be mutually advantageous in predicting and explaining new concepts of cerebellar function.

This is made up of the ''system of the basal ganglia'' itself plus its inputs and outputs. The system of rile basal ganglia may be divided into the ''basal ganglia core'' comprising the striatum and its pallidal and nigral targets and the ''regulators of the core''. Distinguishable include regulators of the striatum (the dopaminergic pars compacta and the central complex of the thalamus or centre median-parafascicularis), regulators of the pallidonigrum (the subthalamic nucleus and the pedunculopontine complex) and internal regulators (at first the lateral nucleus of the pallidum). The main input to this system comes from the cerebral cortex. The main output is the thalamus and from it to the cortex. The whole ''basal ganglia related system'' may thus be seen as a cortico-cortical circuit passing through the basal ganglia. Information processing in the system is very complex. New data presented here emphasize two connections: cortico-striate and striato-pallidonigral connections. It is stressed that the first uses complex combinations of confluence or difluence on small matricial islands. This step could be a selection and reorganisation of cortical information. The second process is a strong ''dynamically focused convergence'' combining information from different upstream sources in order to derive an adequate informational product for the production of harmonious and adaptated matricity.","HOP TENON, SERV MALAD SYST NERVEUX, F-75970 PARIS, FRANCE","4EU+; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Tenon - APHP","PERCHERON, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPTL MOUVEMENT LA, 47 BD HOP, F-75013 PARIS 13, FRANCE.",,"Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013; Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018","YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X",,,,,113,17,18,0,3,"MASSON EDITEUR","MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9","21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE","0035-3787","2213-0004",,"REV NEUROL-FRANCE","Rev.

Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes >0.8 degrees. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes >1 degrees. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.","[Liu, Xu; Li, Hui; Lei, Tianhao; Andolina, Ian Max; Wang, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci,Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Andolina, Ian Max; Wang, Wei] Shanghai Ctr Brain & Brain Inspired Intelligence, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xu; Wang, Wei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ye] Commun Univ China, Neurosci & Intelligent Media Inst, State Key Lab Media Convergence & Commun, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jijun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Mental Hlth Ctr, Shanghai Key Lab Psychot Disorders, Sch Med, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Spillmann, Lothar] Univ Freiburg, Dept Neurol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Communication University of China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Freiburg","Andolina, IM; Wang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci,Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Andolina, IM; Wang, W (corresponding author), Shanghai Ctr Brain & Brain Inspired Intelligence, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Wang, W (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","i.andolina@ion.ac.cn; w.wang@ion.ac.cn","Andolina, Ian Max/S-7179-2019; Li, Hui/GXM-5002-2022","Andolina, Ian Max/0000-0001-9985-3414; ","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB32060200]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant [2018SHZDZX05]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31861143032, 32070992]; Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [19411969100]","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Science and Technology Commission(Shanghai Science & Technology CommitteeScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM))","This work was supported by Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Grant XDB32060200 (to W.W.); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant 2018SHZDZX05 (to W.W. and I.M.A.); National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 31861143032 to W.W.) and 32070992 (to I.M.A.); and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Project Grant 19411969100.",,127,3,3,2,11,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","1529-2401",,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Unfortunately, this definition is not consistently used, and it obscures distinct connectional and functional systems within the orbital cortex. It is difficult to interpret data on the orbital cortex that do not take these different systems into account. Analysis of cortico-cortical connections between areas in the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex indicate two distinct networks in this region. One system, called the orbital network, involves most of the areas in the central orbital cortex. The other system, has been called the medial prefrontal network, though it is actually more complex, since it includes areas on the medial wall, in the medial orbital cortex, and in the posterolateral orbital cortex. Some areas in the medial orbital cortex are involved in both networks. Connections to other brain areas support the distinction between the networks. The orbital network receives several sensory inputs, from olfactory cortex, taste cortex, somatic sensory association cortex, and visual association cortex, and is connected with multisensory areas in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex. The medial network has outputs to the hypothalamus and brain stem and connects to a cortical circuit that includes the rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus and dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, the entorhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortex, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL)","Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","pricej@wustl.edu",,,"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH070941] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,54,266,270,0,29,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0077-8923",,"978-1-57331-683-5","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2007,1121,,,,,,54,71,,"10.1196/annals.1401.008","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.008"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.008"")",,,18,"Behavioral Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Behavioral Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry","BHD18",17698999,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000252265300005","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000252265300005"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of 'medial' and 'orbital' networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory-visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to he critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL)","Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Campus Box 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","pricej@thalamus.wustl.edu",,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC00093] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))",,,116,1930,1961,3,179,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Three animals were analyzed. In two, biotin dextran amine was used as tracer; in the third, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used. Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Intracortical projections were found into the neighboring primary motor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, frontoopercular cortex, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. Projections also ended in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex and agranular as well as granular insula. In addition, weaker labeling was found in the inferior and dorsal parietal cortex, and perirhinal and inferotemporal cortex. Subcortically, there was a heavy projection into the ventral putamen, a moderate projection into the caudate nucleus and claustrum, and a weak projection into the anterior, central and lateral amygdala. In the thalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis lateralis, reticularis, centralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, pulvinaris oralis, centrum medianum, reuniens and suprageniculatus in an order of intensity. Subthalamically, weak projections could be traced into the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the colliculus superior, area praetectalis, dorsal reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal gray. In the lower brainstem, fibers ended in the griseum pontis, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation, paramedian and dorsal reticular nuclei, solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei.

Forward connections are involved in the representation of retinal images, whereas feedback pathways may play a role in the selection and interpretation of visual information. To examine the synaptic mechanisms of forward and feedback connections between primary and secondary visual cortical areas directly, we have performed intracellular recordings in slices of rat visual cortex. Irrespective of stimulus intensity and membrane potential, 78% (45/58) of the cells in striate cortex activated by feedback input showed monosynaptic responses that were depolarizing only, and inhibitory inputs were evident merely as a slight acceleration in the decay of EPSPs. In contrast, in 89% (17/19) of the cells, stimulation of forward input evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), followed by disynaptic, hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs followed by IPSPs also were recorded after stimulation of local connections within primary visual cortex (92%, 12/13) and after activation of thalamocortical input (91%, 10/11). These results suggest that the synaptic organization of feedback connections are distinct from forward, local, and thalamocortical circuits. The findings further indicate that intracortical back projections exert modulatory influences via synaptic mechanisms in which weak inhibitory input is strongly dominated by excitation.","WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63110","Washington University (WUSTL)",,,,,"NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY005935, EY05935] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,73,111,111,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Manipulating visual experience in kittens by the induction of squint leads to the emergence of ocular dominance columns with a Larger size and larger column-to-column spacing than in normally raised animals. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is presently unknown. Theory suggests that experience cannot influence the spacing of columns if the development proceeds through purely Hebbian mechanisms. Here we study a developmental model in which Hebbian mechanisms are complemented by activity-dependent regulation of the total strength of afferent synapses converging onto a cortical neurone. We show that this model implies an influence of visual experience on the spacing of ocular dominance columns and provides a conceptually simple explanation for the emergence of larger sized columns in squinting animals. Assuming that during development cortical neurones become active in local groups, which we call co-activated cortical domains (CCDs), ocular dominance segregation is controlled by the size of these groups: (1) Size and spacing of ocular dominance columns are proportional to the size sigma of CCDs. (2) There is a critical size sigma* of CCDs such that ocular dominance columns form if sigma < <sigma>* but do not form spontaneously if sigma > sigma*. This critical size of CCDs is determined by the correlation functions of activity patterns in the two eyes and specifies the influence of experience on ocular dominance segregation. We show that sigma* is larger with squint than with normal visual experience. Since experimental evidence indicates that the size of CCDs decreases during development, ocular dominance columns are predicted to form earlier and with a larger spacing in squinters compared to normal animals.

All 4 circuits were replicated and dissociated in an independent data set (n = 40). Direct comparison of right- and left-seeded frontal regions revealed contralateral lateralization in the cerebellum for each of the segregated circuits. The presence of circuits that involve prefrontal regions confirms that the cerebellum participates in networks important to cognition including a specific fronto-cerebellar circuit that interacts with the default network. Overall, the extent of the cerebellum associated with prefrontal cortex included a large portion of the posterior hemispheres consistent with a prominent role of the cerebellum in nonmotor functions.

Four to five days after virus injections into M1, we observed many densely labeled neurons in localized regions of the output nuclei of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The largest numbers of these neurons were found in portions of the dentate nucleus and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPI). Smaller numbers of labeled neurons were found in portions of the interpositus nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The distribution of neuronal labeling varied with the cortical injection site. For example, within the dentate, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located rostrally, those from face M1 caudally, and those from arm M1 at intermediate levels. In each instance, labeled neurons were confined to approximately the dorsal third of the nucleus. Within GPI, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located in dorsal and medial regions, those from face M1 in ventral and lateral regions, and those from arm M1 in intermediate regions. These results demonstrate that M1 is the target of somatotopically organized outputs from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia, Surprisingly, the projections to M1 originate from only 30% of the volume of the dentate and <15% of GPI, Thus, the majority of the outputs from the cerebellum and basal ganglia are directed to cortical areas other than M1.","Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurosci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Physiol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Millersville University of Pennsylvania; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center","Strick, PL (corresponding author), Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, 1515S, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",,,,"PHS HHS [151S] Funding Source: Medline","PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,71,330,338,0,11,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Tracer studies in adult macaques have shown that the basolateral subnuclei differentially connect to parts of visual cortex, with stronger connections to anterior regions and weaker connections to posterior regions; infant macaques show robust connectivity even with posterior visual regions. Do these developmental differences also exist in the human amygdala, and are there specific functional regions that undergo the most pronounced developmental changes in their connections with the amygdala? To address these questions, we explored the functional connectivity (from resting-state fMRI data) of the basolateral amygdala to occipitotemporal cortex in human neonates scanned within one week of life and compared the connectivity patterns to those observed in young adults. Specifically, we calculated amygdala connectivity to anterior-posterior gradients of the anatomically-defined occipitotemporal cortex, and also to putative occipitotemporal functional parcels, including primary and high-level visual and auditory cortices (V1, A1, face, scene, object, body, high-level auditory regions). Results showed a decreasing gradient of functional connectivity to the occipitotemporal cortex in adults-similar to the gradient seen in macaque tracer studies-but no such gradient was observed in neonates. Further, adults had stronger connections to high-level functional regions associated with face, body, and object processing, and weaker connections to primary sensory regions (i.e., A1, V1), whereas neonates showed the same amount of connectivity to primary and high-level sensory regions. Overall, these results show that functional connectivity between the amygdala and occipitotemporal cortex is not yet differentiated in neonates, suggesting a role of maturation and experience in shaping these connections later in life.","[Hansen, Heather A.; Li, Jin; Saygin, Zeynep M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","University System of Ohio; Ohio State University","Hansen, HA; Saygin, ZM (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","hansen.508@osu.edu; saygin.3@osu.edu","Saygin, Zeynep M./AAV-4951-2020","Hansen, Heather/0000-0002-8917-2516","Alfred P.

Only a few previous studies have been concerned with the distribution of the subtypes of EAA receptor binding in the primate brain. We examined NMDA- and quisqualate-sensitive [H-3]glutamate binding using quantitative autoradiography in monkey brain (Macaca fascicularis). The two types of binding were differentially distributed. NMDA-sensitive binding was most dense in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, stratum pyramidale of hippocampus, and outer layers of cerebral cortex. Quisqualate-sensitive binding was most dense in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, inner and outer layers of cerebral cortex, and molecular layer of cerebellum. In caudate nucleus and putamen, quisqualate- and NMDA-sensitive binding sites were nearly equal in density. However, in globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus, quisqualate-sensitive binding was several-fold greater than NMDA-sensitive binding. In thalamus, [H-3]glutamate binding was generally low for both subtypes of binding except for the anterior ventral, lateral dorsal, and pulvinar nuclei. In the brainstem, low levels of binding were found, and strikingly the red nucleus and pons, which are thought to receive glutamatergic projections, had approximately 1/20 the binding observed in cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate that NMDA- and quisqualate-sensitive [H-3]glutamate binding are observed in all regions of primate brain, but that in some regions one subtype predominates over the other. In addition, certain areas thought to receive glutamatergic projections have low levels of both types of binding.","UNIV MICHIGAN,MED CTR,DEPT NEUROL,1500 E MED CTR DR,1914 TAUBMAN CTR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan",,,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS19613] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,53,55,55,0,0,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012","0360-4012",,,"J NEUROSCI RES","J.

However, knowledge of the reversibility of these neurotoxic effects based on in vivo evaluations of serotonin transport (SERT) availability remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurotoxicity of MDMA after 66 months abstinence and explored whether Dextromethorphan, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, could attenuate MDMA-induced neurotoxicity using 4-[F-18]-ADAM, an imaging ligand that selectively targets SERT, with positron emission tomography technology (PET). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were used in this study: control, MDMA, and DM + MDMA. Static 4-[F-18]-ADAM PET was performed at 60 and 66 months after drug treatment. Serotonin transport (SERT) availability was presented as the specific uptake ratios (SURs) of 4-[F-18]-ADAM in brain regions. Voxel-based region-specific SERT availability was calculated to generate 3D PET/MR images. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetric analysis was also conducted at 60 months. Significantly decreased 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs were observed in the striatum and thalamus of the MDMA group at 60 and 66 months compared to controls; the midbrain and frontal cortex SURs were similar at 60 and 66 months in the MDMA and control groups. All eleven brain regions showed significantly lower (similar to 13%) self-recovery rates over time; the occipital cortex and cingulate recovered to baseline by 66 months. DM attenuated MDMA-induced SERT deficiency on average, by similar to 8 and similar to 1% at 60 and 66 months, respectively; whereas significant differences were observed between the thalamus and amygdala of the MDMA and DM + MDMA groups at 66 months. Compared to controls, the MDMA group exhibited significantly increased (similar to 6.6%) gray matter volumes in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, midbrain, and amygdala. Moreover, the gray matter volumes of the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala correlated negatively with the 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs of the same regions. DM (n = 2) did not appear to affect MDMA-induced volumetric changes. The 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs, lower self-recovery rate and increased volumetric values indicate the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala still exhibit MDMA-induced neurotoxicity after 66 months' abstinence. Moreover, DM may prevent MDMA-induced serotonergic deficiency, as indicated by increased 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs and SERT availability, but not volumetric changes.","[Yeh, Skye Hsin-Hsien; Yu, Tsung-Hsun] Natl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Brain Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yeh, Skye Hsin-Hsien] Natl Def Med Ctr, Sch Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kuo, Yu-Yeh] Hsin Sheng Coll Med Care & Management, Dept Nursing, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-Sheng] Cheng Hsin Gen Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Wen-Sheng; Tsai, Chi-Jung] Taipei Med Univ Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chuang-Hsin; Cheng, Cheng-Yi] Triserv Gen Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ii, Leo Garcia Flores] Radiomedix Inc, Houston, TX USA; [Ma, Kuo-Hsing] Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Biol & Anat, Taipei, Taiwan","National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Defense Medical Center; Cheng Hsin General Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University Hospital; Tri-Service General Hospital; National Defense Medical Center","Tsai, CJ (corresponding author), Taipei Med Univ Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan.;Cheng, CY (corresponding author), Triserv Gen Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Taipei, Taiwan.;Ma, KH (corresponding author), Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Biol & Anat, Taipei, Taiwan.","gironggirl@hotmail.com; chengcy60@gmail.com; kuohsing91@yahoo.com.tw",,,"Ministry of Science and Technology R.O.C.

It is involved in high order association functions that include the integration of emotion, behavior, and various sensory processes. To define the cyto- and chemo-architectonic organization of the human orbitofrontal cortex, we have used antibodies to the nonphosphorylated neurofilament triplet protein and to the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calretinin. Immunohistochemistry revealed labeling patterns corresponding to the cytoarchitecture defined by Nissl preparations. Neurofilament protein-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were located only in layers V-VI in the agranular posterior orbitofrontal cortex, whereas they were distributed in both layers III and V-VI in the anteromedial and anterolateral granular regions. The intermediate dysgranular portion of the orbitofrontal cortex represented a transition zone with a progressive decrease in layer III labeled pyramidal cell numbers posteriorly. The distribution of parvalbumin- and calretinin-immunoreactive interneurons was more homogeneous, although the posteromedial region and the cortex of the inferior rostral sulcus had slightly lower parvalbumin-positive neuron counts than the other orbitofrontal areas. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the neuropil exhibited a high degree of regional specialization in that it was consistently less intense in the cortex of the intermediate and posterior part of the gyrus rectus, whereas the other orbitofrontal areas had a very dense neuropil staining in layers III to V. Also, there was a dense plexus of parvalbumin-immunoreactive fibers restricted to layer I in the posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex, and patches of neuropil staining in layer III of the inferior rostral sulcus. These region-specific neuropil staining patterns may correspond to the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive thalamocortical projections to distinct domains of the orbitofrontal cortex. This regional parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex as defined by specific neuronal markers, may represent an anatomical substrate for the localization of the various functions attributed to this poorly understood cortical region.

The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the postcommissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord.","Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Neurobiol Lab, Beauport, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada","Laval University","Parent, A (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Neurobiol Lab, 2601 Canardiere,Local F-6500, Beauport, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada.","Andre.Parent@anm.ulaval.ca",,,,,,,59,89,89,0,5,"WILEY-LISS","HOBOKEN","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

Thus, AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is anterogradely transported (e.g., from cell bodies to nerve terminals) in both rat and non-human primate (NHP) brain. In contrast, AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) is retrogradely transported from terminals to neuronal cell bodies in the rat brain. However, the directionality of axonal transport of AAV6 in the NHP brain has not been determined. In this study, two Cynomolgus macaques received an infusion of AAV6 harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum (caudate and putamen) by magnetic resonance (MR)-guided convection-enhanced delivery. One month after infusion, immunohistochemical staining of brain sections revealed a striatal GFP expression that corresponded well with MR signal observed during gene delivery. As shown previously in rats, GFP expression was detected throughout the prefrontal, frontal and parietal cortex, as well as the substantia nigra pars compacta and thalamus, indicating retrograde transport of the vector in NHP. AAV6-GFP preferentially transduced neurons, although a few astrocytes were also transduced. Transduction of non-neuronal cells in the brain was associated with the upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex-II and lymphocytic infiltration as previously observed with AAV1 and AAV9. This contrasts with highly specific neuronal transduction in the rat brain. Retrograde axonal transport of AAV6 from a single striatal infusion permits efficient transduction of cortical neurons in significant tissue volumes that otherwise would be difficult to achieve.","[San Sebastian, W.; Samaranch, L.; Heller, G.; Kells, A.

These cytoarchitectural divisions and connections are discussed in terms of how they may influence thinking about the OFC's contribution to obsessive-compulsive disorder.","UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT PSYCHIAT, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Zald, DH (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT PSYCHOL, N218 ELLIOTT HALL, 75 E RIVER RD, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA.",,"Zald, David H/A-1448-2011",,,,,,119,128,130,0,12,"AMER PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING, INC","WASHINGTON","800 MAINE AVE SW, SUITE 900, WASHINGTON, DC 20024 USA","0895-0172","1545-7222",,"J NEUROPSYCH CLIN N","J.

A critical node in this network is the posterior cingulate, precuneal, and retrosplenial cortices. The cytological and neurochemical composition of this region is reviewed in relation to the Brodmann map. This region has the highest level of cortical glucose metabolism and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Monkey studies suggest that the anterior thalamic projection likely drives retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortex metabolism and that the midbrain projection to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus is a key coupling site between the brainstem system for arousal and cortical systems for cognitive processing and awareness. The pivotal role of the posterior cingulate, precuneal, and retrosplenial cortices in consciousness is demonstrated with posterior cingulate epilepsy cases, midcingulate lesions that de-afferent this region and are associated with unilateral sensory neglect, observations from stroke and vegetative state patients, alterations in blood flow during sleep, and the actions of general anesthetics. Since this region is critically involved in self reflection, it is not surprising that it is similarly a site for the NNCC. Interestingly, information processing during complex cognitive tasks and during aversive sensations such as pain induces efforts to terminate self reflection and result in decreased processing in posterior cingulate and precuneal cortices.","Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; SUNY Upstat Med Univ, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Univ Liege, Cyclotron Res Ctr, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Liege, Dept Neurol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; University of Liege; University of Liege","Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.","bvogt@twcny.rr.com","Laureys, Steven/A-3349-2011; Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015","Laureys, Steven/0000-0002-3096-3807; Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410","NINDS NIH HHS [NS44222, R01 NS044222, R01 NS044222-05] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,59,386,398,0,37,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"0-444-51851-7","PROG BRAIN RES","Prog.

Endeavors to understand its role in vision have focused on its abundant connections with the visual cortex. While its connectivity mapping in the cortex displays a broad topographic organization, its projections are also marked by considerable convergence and divergence. As a result, the pulvinar is often regarded as a central forebrain hub. Moreover, new evidence suggests that its comparatively modest input from structures such as the retina and superior colliculus may critically shape the functional organization of the visual cortex, particularly during early development.

Interposed between these two sites is a large transitional field. We have earlier demonstrated experimentally in rats with H-3-thymidine autoradiography that this transitional field is a stratified structure composed of discrete layers of migrating and sojourning cells, and fiber bands. Here we show that the different layers of the stratified transitional field are identifiable without experimental procedures in the developing human cerebral cortex and that there are conspicuous regional differences in its stratification. At the peak of its development, the stratified transitional field contains three fibrous bands in an inside-out order: the commissural fibers of the corpus callosum, the thalamocortical and corticofugal projection fibers, and the expanding white matter. There are regional differences in the thickness of these fibrous layers as well as in the number and configuration of the perikaryal layers. This preview focuses on laminar differences of the transitional fields of the agranular frontal lobe and the granular parietal and occipital lobes. At the latter sites, but not in the frontal lobe, there is a distinctive multi-layered band, the honeycomb matrix, where radially oriented fiber columns are sandwiched between two perikaryal sublayers and are separated from one another by radially oriented cells. We postulate that the radial fiber columns of the honeycomb matrix are composed of topographically organized thalamocortical fibers and that the unspecified young neurons acquire their enduring topographic identity by making selective contacts with tagged fibers here before they resume their radial or tangential migration to the cortical plate.","Dev Neurobiol Lab, Indianapolis, IN 46278 USA",,"Altman, J (corresponding author), Dev Neurobiol Lab, 7715 W 88th St, Indianapolis, IN 46278 USA.",,,,,,,,21,18,18,0,3,"KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-4864",,,"J NEUROCYTOL","J.

These are important for the accurate location of visual objects in extrapersonal space, It can be predicted that these areas will show increased activation during the performance of eye movements at high frequency. In the present study PET and measurements of the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used as indirect measures of neural activity. Two independent groups of normal volunteers performed large-amplitude self-generated eye movements in complete darkness, thus removing the confounding effects of visual stimulation on parietooccipital activation. The first group (group A; n = 5) served as a hypothesis-generating group and the second group (group B; n = 4) served as a hypothesis-testing group, The data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping at a significance level corrected for multiple comparisons (group A, Z > 4.08; group B, Z > 4.04), Significant rCBF increases were found for both groups in the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, cerebellar vermis and putamina/thalami. Additionally, activation was found in the cunei in the posterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus, Also, the extraocular muscles were activated and, as a consequence of the partial volume effect, projected to the orbitofrontal cortices, At a less conservative threshold, activation was found close to the intraparietal sulci on the left side (Z = 3.91, P = 0.09) and right side (Z = 3.33, P = 0.42), The locations of these areas were confirmed in group B with reference to high-resolution structural MRI scans. The activation of the parieto-occipital cortex without overt visual stimuli is interpreted as the result of neural activity related to the reception of efferent copies of motor commands and/or the activation of neurons coding for eye position relative to the orbits. These are important constituents for the location and remapping of visual stimuli in space.","Univ Copenhagen Hosp, Neurobiol Res Unit, Rigshosp, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Hvidovre Univ Hosp, Danish Res Ctr Magnet Resonance, Hvidovre, Denmark","Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen","Law, I (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen Hosp, Neurobiol Res Unit, Rigshosp, N9201,9 Blegdamsvej, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.","ilaw@pet.rh.dk","Rostrup, Egill/D-8622-2017; Paulson, Olaf B./N-6924-2016","Rostrup, Egill/0000-0001-5015-5244; Paulson, Olaf B./0000-0001-7712-8596; Law, Ian/0000-0001-9644-7496; Svarer, Claus/0000-0001-7811-1825",,,,,67,51,51,0,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","NOV",1998,121,,11,,,,2189,2200,,"10.1093/brain/121.11.2189","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.11.2189"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.11.2189"")",,,12,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","145KY",9827777,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000077371100015","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000077371100015"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

This classification is supported by the. finding that response linearity is bimodally distributed across neurons in area V1 of anesthetized animals. However, recent studies suggest that such bimodal distribution may not reflect two neuronal types but a nonlinear relationship between the membrane potential and the spike output. A main limitation of these previous studies is that they measured response linearity in anesthetized animals, where the distance between the neuronal membrane potential and the spike threshold is artificially increased by anesthesia. Here, we measured V1 response linearity in the awake brain and its correlation with the neuronal spontaneous. ring rate, which is related to the distance between membrane potential and threshold. Our results demonstrate that response linearity is bimodally distributed in awake V1 but that it is poorly correlated with spontaneous. ring rate. In contrast, the spontaneous. ring rate is best correlated to the response selectivity and response latency to stimuli.","[Chen, Yao; Anand, Sanjiv] SUNY, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY USA; [Martinez-Conde, Susana; Macknik, Stephen L.] Barrow Neurol Inst, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; [Bereshpolova, Yulia; Swadlow, Harvey A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT USA; [Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Community College; SUNY Maritime College; SUNY Optometry; Barrow Neurological Institute; University of Connecticut; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Community College; SUNY Maritime College; SUNY Optometry","Alonso, JM (corresponding author), 33 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036 USA.","jalonso@sunyopt.edu","Macknik, Stephen L./H-7704-2019","Macknik, Stephen L./0000-0002-3143-9230","NIH-EY [14345]; NIH-NS [059753]; The Research Foundation","NIH-EY(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH-NS; The Research Foundation","We would like to thank Nadia Gamez Gomez and Javier Cubo Villalba for helping in the development of analysis software.

In previous studies, electroacupuncture (EA) with 2/15 Hz has been shown to enhance the sedative effects in general anesthesia patients. Central lateral thalamic stimulation of 50 Hz showed an arousal effect in macaques. Therefore, it is worth studying the sedative effect of EA at peripheral acupoints with different frequencies, especially the frequency of around 50 Hz. Methods. Rats were anesthetized under the constant infusion of propofol and EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) locations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate were continuously recorded before and after the intervention by EA in the C group (control), LEA group (low-frequency group, 2/15 Hz diffuse/dense wave EA stimulation), and HEA group (high-frequency group, 50 Hz stimulation). Results. In the LEA group, a significant increase in the power of the delta component with a decrease in the alpha component p < 0.05 was observed after EA stimulation. In the HEA group, significant increases in the powers of alpha and beta components of EEG p < 0.05 and a decrease in the delta component of EEG were observed p < 0.05. The phenomenon is also shown in full-frequency waves. In addition, a significant decrease in the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio parameter was observed in the LEA group. Conclusions. EA at bilateral ST36 and PC6 can enhance the sedative effects of propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but lighten the sedative effects in high-frequency (50 Hz) stimulation.

Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of F-18-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable A beta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for F-18-Fluselenarnyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Methods: To evaluate safety profiles of F-18-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring A beta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Results: The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the F-18-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusions: The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that F-18-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, F-18-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that F-18-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Division of labor in frontal eye field neurons during presaccadic remapping of visual receptive fields. J Neurophysiol 108: 2144-2159, 2012. First published July 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00204.2012.-Our percept of visual stability across saccadic eye movements may be mediated by presaccadic remapping. Just before a saccade, neurons that remap become visually responsive at a future field (FF), which anticipates the saccade vector. Hence, the neurons use corollary discharge of saccades. Many of the neurons also decrease their response at the receptive field (RF). Presaccadic remapping occurs in several brain areas including the frontal eye field (FEF), which receives corollary discharge of saccades in its layer IV from a collicular-thalamic pathway. We studied, at two levels, the microcircuitry of remapping in the FEF. At the laminar level, we compared remapping between layers IV and V. At the cellular level, we compared remapping between different neuron types of layer IV. In the FEF in four monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we identified 27 layer IV neurons with orthodromic stimulation and 57 layer V neurons with antidromic stimulation from the superior colliculus. With the use of established criteria, we classified the layer IV neurons as putative excitatory (n = 11), putative inhibitory (n = 12), or ambiguous (n = 4). We found that just before a saccade, putative excitatory neurons increased their visual response at the RF, putative inhibitory neurons showed no change, and ambiguous neurons increased their visual response at the FF. None of the neurons showed presaccadic visual changes at both RF and FF. In contrast, neurons in layer V showed full remapping (at both the RF and FF). Our data suggest that elemental signals for remapping are distributed across neuron types in early cortical processing and combined in later stages of cortical microcircuitry.","[Sommer, Marc A.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Sommer, Marc A.] Duke Univ, Duke Inst Brain Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Shin, SooYoon; Sommer, Marc A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Shin, SooYoon; Sommer, Marc A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Shin, SooYoon] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, Keck Ctr Integrat Neurosci, San Francisco, CA USA","Duke University; Duke University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of California System; University of California San Francisco","Sommer, MA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Biomed Engn, 136 Hudson Hall,Box 90281, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","marc.sommer@duke.edu",,"Sommer, Marc/0000-0001-5061-763X","National Eye Institute Grant [EY017592]; Alfred P.

The variation of the total number of boutons and the total axonal length was large (789-7912 boutons, 12-126 mm). The overall linear bouton density for smooth cells was higher than that of spiny cells and thalamic afferents (mean +/- sd, 110 +/- 21 and 78 +/- 27 boutons per mm of axonal length). The distribution of boutons varied according to their location on the tree. Distal axon collaterals (first and second order segments in Horton-Strahler ordering) of smooth neurons had a 3.5 times higher, spiny cells and thalamic afferents a 2 times higher bouton density compared to the higher order (more proximal) segments. The distribution of interbouton intervals was positively skewed and similar for cells of the same type. In most cases a gamma-distribution fitted well, but the distributions had a tendency to have a heavier tail. To a first approximation these bouton distributions are consistent with both diffuse and specific models of interneuronal connections. Quite simple rules can explain these distributions and the connections between the different classes of neurons.","Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Martin, KAC (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","kevan@ini.phys.ethz.ch",,,,,,,55,32,32,0,1,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-4864",,,"J NEUROCYTOL","J.

During each fixation, in addition to analyzing the object at which we are looking, a decision has to be made as to where to look next. Although we perform this task with the greatest of ease, the computations to perform the task are complex and involve numerous brain structures. We have applied several investigative tools that include single-cell recordings, microstimulation, pharmacological manipulations and lesions to learn more about the neural control of visually guided eye saccadic movements. Electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), areas V1 and V2, the lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP), the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the medial eye fields (MEF) produces saccadic eye movements at low current levels. After ablation of the SC, electrical microstimulation of V1, V2, and LIP no longer elicits saccadic eye movements whereas stimulation of the FEF and MEF continues to be effective. Ablation of the SC but not of the FEF eliminates short-latency saccadic eye movements to Visual targets called express saccades, whereas lesions of the FEF selectively interfere with target selection. Bilateral removal of both the SC and the FEF causes major, long lasting deficits: all visually elicited saccadic eye movements are eliminated. In intact monkeys, subthreshold electrical microstimulation of the FEF and MEF as well as the lower layers of V1 and V2 and of some subregions of LIP greatly facilitates the choice of targets presented in the receptive fields of the stimulated neurons. By contrast, stimulation of the upper layers of V1 and V2 and other sub-regions of LIP produces a dramatic interference in target selection. Examination of the role of inhibitory circuits in eye-movement generation reveals that local infusion of muscimol, a GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) agonist, or bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, interferes with target selection in V1. On the other hand, infusion of bicuculline into the FEF produces facilitation in target choice and irrepressible saccades. It appears therefore that inhibitory circuits play a central role in visual analysis in V1 and in the generation of saccadic eye movements in the FEF. It is proposed that two major streams can be discerned in visually guided eye-movement control, the posterior from occipital and parietal cortex that reaches the brainstem via the SC and the anterior from the FEF and MEF that has direct access to the brainstem oculomotor centers.","MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Schiller, PH (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E25-634, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","phschill@mit.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY08502, EY00676] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,42,79,80,0,10,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"0-444-51679-4","PROG BRAIN RES","Prog.

Nevertheless, we have found that their one-dimensional metrics and topologies are surprisingly similar. To discover this, we analysed the axonal branching pattern of 39 neurons (23 spiny, 13 smooth and three thalamic axons) that were filled intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) during in vivo experiments in cat area 17. The axons were completely reconstructed and translated into dendrograms. Topological, fractal and Horton-Strahler analyses indicated that axons of smooth and spiny neurons had similar complexity, length ratios (a measure of the relative increase in the length of collateral segments as the axon branches) and bifurcation ratios (a measure of the relative increase in the number of collateral segments as the axon branches).

GAD-like immunoreactivity (GAD-LI) was assessed in the retina, in primary retinorecipient targets, and in thalamic nuclear groups postsynaptic to primary retinal terminal zones. Within the retina, the inner plexiform layer displayed intense GAD-LI, but immunoreactivity was absent in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Putative amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cell somata were also labeled. Centrally, GAD-LI was observed in all primary visual nuclei. Dense, GAD-like immunoreactive punctate structures (puncta), presumably terminals, were observed in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, posterior thalamic neuropil, and uncinate neuropil. GAD-like immunoreactive puncta were noted in several laminae of the optic tectum, with the highest concentrations located within the 9th and 8th laminae. Moderate numbers of CAD-like immunoreactive puncta were found in the mesencephalic nucleus of the basal optic root, and two thalamic neuropils-corpus geniculatum and neuropil of Bellonci. The ventrolateral area, posterocentral nucleus, and posterolateral nucleus all contained sparse amounts of GAD-LI. These observations suggest that GABA plays an important physiological role in all central visual areas of Rana pipiens.

We found that these areas receive major disynaptic inputs from specific portions of the cerebellar nuclei, the ventral dentate (D), and ventrolateral interpositus posterior (IP). Area LIPv receives inputs from oculomotor domains of the caudal D and IP. Area MIP is the target of projections from the ventral D (mainly middle third), and gaze- and arm-related domains of IP involved in reaching and arm/eye/head coordination. We also showed that cerebellar cortical output channels to MIP predominantly stem from posterior cerebellar areas (paramedian lobe/Crus II posterior, dorsal paraflocculus) that have the required connectivity for adaptive control of visual and proprioceptive guidance of reaching, arm/eye/head coordination, and prism adaptation.

We applied a structural equation method to regional receptor binding. The results indicated that the network models of the patients and normal subjects were significantly different. As to the individual path coefficients, (a) connectivity between cortical regions was different between groups; (b) connectivity from the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and thalamus to the anterior cingulate differed from that in controls; and (c) connectivity from the prefrontal cortex to the anterior cingulate and thalamus via the hippocampus was observed in normal subjects but not in patients.

Temporal and spectral features of click trains are differentially encoded in A1. Encoding of temporal features occurs at rates of 100-200 Hz through phase-locked activity in the MUA and CSD, is independent of pulse polarity pattern, and occurs in high best frequency (BF) regions of A1. The upper limit of ensemble-wide phase-locking is about 400 Hz in the input to A1, as manifested in the cortical middle laminae CSD and MUA of thalamocortical fibers. In contrast, encoding of spectral features occurs in low BF regions, and resolves both the f(0) and harmonics of the stimuli through local maxima of activity determined by the tonotopic organization of the recording sites. High-pass filtered click trains decrease spectral encoding in low BF regions without modifying phase-locked responses in high BF regions. These physiological responses parallel features of human pitch perception for click trains, and support the existence of two distinct physiological mechanisms involved in pitch perception: the first using resolved harmonic components and the second utilizing unresolved harmonics that is based on encoding stimulus waveform periodicity.

J. Neurophysiol. 82: 1876-1882, 1999. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine, in the primate, the role of the postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) system and that of the spinothalamic tract (STT) in viscerosensory processing by comparing the responses of neurons in these pathways to colorectal distension (CRD). Experiments were done on four anesthetized male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Extracellular recordings were made from a total of 100 neurons randomly located in the L(6)S(1) segments of the spinal cord. Most of these neurons had cutaneous receptive fields in the perineal area, on the hind limbs or on the rump. Forty-eight percent were PSDC neurons activated antidromically from the upper cervical dorsal column or the nucleus gracilis, 17% were STT neurons activated antidromically from the thalamus, and 35% were unidentified. Twenty-one PSDC neurons, located mostly near the central canal, were excited by CRD and three were inhibited. Twenty-four PSDC neurons, mostly located in the nucleus proprius, did not respond to CRD. Of the 17 STT neurons, 7 neurons were excited by CRD, 4 neurons were inhibited, and 6 neurons did not respond to CRD. Of the unidentified neurons, 23 were excited by CRD, 7 were inhibited, and 5 did not respond. The average responses of STT and PSDC neurons excited by CRD were comparable in magnitude and duration. These results suggest. that the major role of the PSDC pathway in viscerosensory processing may be due to a quantitative rather than a qualitative neuronal dominance over the STT.","Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Inst Marine Biomed, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston","Willis, WD (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Anat & Neurosci, 301 Univ Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS-09743, NS-11255] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,49,34,36,0,5,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Subthalamotomy resulted in a bilateral improvement of tremor spontaneous activity, bradykinesia (evaluated by a manual motor test) and freezing in Group C. All these monkeys developed hemichorea contralateral to the lesion. The improvement was maintained and the hemichorea continued until death. The monkeys in group D showed severe hemiballism which persisted throughout MPTP administration and developed parkinsonian signs mainly on the side ipsilateral to the lesion. Analysis of the in situ hybridization of the mRNA coding for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) of MPTP monkeys showed a significant increase in the mean density of silver grains over every labelled neuron in the globus pallidum lateralis (56.8% over control) as well as the globus pallidus medialis (GPM) (45.7% over control) and the substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) (35.8% over control). No significant change was observed in the thalamic nucleus reticular's. Subthalamotomy (Groups C and D) produced a significant reduction in mRNA GAD expression on the side of the lesion in the GPM and the SNR (34% and 42.3%, respectively) with respect to the ipsilateral (non-lesioned) side and also when compared with parkinsonian monkeys. These results confirm and expand, at the cellular level, the paramount role of STN hyperactivity in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism.

A series of non-amine-bearing aryloxatropanes that are potent inhibitors of the dopamine transporter (DAT) challenged this precept. In the present study, we investigated the brain distribution of a selective, high-affinity DAT non-amine, [H-3] tropoxene (2-carbomethoxy-3,4dichloro-3-aryl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1] octene), which binds to the DAT in monkey striatum. The autoradiographic distribution of [H-3]tropoxene was conducted in tissue sections of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkey brain. Highest accumulation of the radioligand was detected in the putamen and caudate nucleus, with significant levels also observed in the nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra. Moderate to low levels of [H-3]tropoxene binding were noted in the hypothalamus, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and thalamus. The distribution of [H-3]tropoxene was restricted to brain regions previously identified as expressing DAT, and the relative densities of [H-3]tropoxene binding sites in various brain regions corresponded to those observed with other selective monoamine radioligands for the DAT. This is the first; report to demonstrate that transporter-selective compounds that bear no amine nitrogen in their structure bind selectively to brain regions rich in the transporter. The results support our conclusion that an amine nitrogen is not necessary for compounds to bind to monoamine transporters and distribute in brain according to the known distribution of transporters. The findings provide further incentives to investigate the pharmacological potential of transport inhibitors lacking an amine nitrogen in the molecular structure.

In order to optogenetically investigate the large and complex primate brain, an optical-/electrical probe, or optrode, must be inserted deeply, which requires the optrode to be not only long and stiff, but also sharp and smooth to reduce possible tissue damage. This study presents a tungsten microelectrode-based optrode that encloses optical fibers within its insulation glass. Optical fibers and a tungsten wire were tightly bound to each other and integrally coated with a smooth, thin layer of glass. This design satisfied the structural requirements for use in deep brain structures. The performance of the optrode was then examined in the thalamus of the rat and macaque monkeys which were injected with lentiviral vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-EYFP) transgene. With fluorescence measurements via the optical fiber, ChR2-EYFP expression was detected clearly in vivo, which was confirmed by histological analysis in the rat. With photostimulation and extracellular recording, photo-responsive single-unit activities were isolated in the monkeys. The depth distribution of these units and the peak of the EYFP fluorescence profile overlapped consistently with each other. Thus, by developing a new probe, optogenetic methodology was successfully applied to a primate subcortical structure. This smooth glass-coated optrode is a promising tool for chronic in vivo experiments with various research targets including deep brain structures in behaving monkeys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Identification involves correlation of sequential spectral slices of the stimulus-driven neural activity with stored representations in association with multimodal memories. verbal lexicons, and contextual information. Identities are then consolidated ill auditory short-term memory and bound with attribute information (usually pitch, loudness, and direction) that has been integrated according to the identities' spectral properties. Attention to, or recall of, a particular identify will excite a particular sequence in the identification hierarchies and so lead to modulation of thalamus and inferior colliculus neural spectrotemporal response fields.

Since the human circadian timing system cannot be studied experimentally, we have used another primate, the macaque monkey, to help provide insight into the organization of the human circadian system. The retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) in the monkey projects to the SCN, the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, and the retrochiasmatic area in a pattern very similar to that in the rat. The monkey SCN has a population of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing (VIP+) neurons in a zone that overlaps the RHT termination and the termination of neuropeptide Y-containing (NPY+) axons arising in the IGL. This zone is surrounded by a population of vasopressin-containing (VP+) neurons. The human SCN is similar to that of other mammals with populations of VIP+ and VP+ neurons, but it differs in having a large population of neurotensin-containing (NT+) neurons that extends over the entire nucleus, and a moderate population of NPY+ neurons located centrally in the nucleus in the presumed area of RHT termination. The lateral geniculate nucleus in the monkey and human is quite different from that in rodents, but contains an area in the pregeniculate nucleus that receives bilateral retinal projections in the monkey and is characterized in both the monkey and human by a population of NPY+ neurons and a plexus of enkephalin- and substance P-containing axons. This nucleus appears homologous to the rodent IGL.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PSYCHIAT,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT NEUROL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT BEHAV NEUROSCI,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","MOORE, RY (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,CTR NEUROSCI,BST W1657,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.",,"Jansen, Heiko T./A-5770-2008","Jansen, Heiko T./0000-0003-0178-396X",,,,,15,50,52,0,1,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320","0748-7304",,,"J BIOL RHYTHM","J.

We summarize results from three groups of PET studies of regional CBF. The results show a double dissociation between (i) selection of movements, which induces differential effects in the basal ganglia but nor the cerebellum, and (ii) sensory information processing, which involves the cerebellum but not the basal ganglia. The first set of studies concerned motor learning of a sequence of finger movements; there was a shift of activation in the anterior-posterior direction of the basal ganglia which paralleled changes in the motor areas of the frontal cortex. During new learning, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum (caudate nucleus and anterior putamen) were activated. When subjects had to select movements, the premotor cortex and mid-putamen were activated. With automatic (overlearned) movements, the sensorimotor cortex and posterior putamen were activated. When subjects paid attention to overlearned actions, activation shifted back to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum. The cerebellum was not activated when subjects made new decisions, attended to their actions or selected movements. These results demonstrate components of basal ganglia-(thalamo)-cortical loops in humans. According to earlier studies in animals we propose that the basal ganglia may be concerned with selecting movements or the selection of appropriate muscles to perform a movement selected by cortical areas (e.g. premotor cortex). Secondly, a visuomotor co-ordination task was examined. In the absence of visual control over arm movements, subjects were required to use a computer mouse to either generate new lines or to re-trace lines on a computer screen. The neocerebellum (hemispheres of the posterior lobe, cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar vermis), not the basal ganglia, was more engaged when lines were re-traced (compared with new line generation). Animal experiments have shown that error detection (deviation from given lines) and correction occurs during line re-tracing but not line generation. Our data suggest that the neocerebellum (not the basal ganglia) is involved in monitoring and optimizing movements using sensory (proprioceptive) feedback. Thirdly, the relative contribution of sensory information processing to the signal during active/passive execution of a motor task (flexion and extension of the elbow) was examined; it was found that 80-90% of the neocerebellar signal could be attributed to sensory information processing. The basal ganglia were not involved in sensory information processing. They may be concerned with movement/muscle selection (efferent motor component); the neocerebellum may be concerned with monitoring the outcome (afferent sensory component) and optimizing movements using sensory (feedback) information.","Univ Clin Essen, Dept Psychiat, Essen, Germany; Univ Clin Jena, Dept Neurol, Jena, Germany","University of Duisburg Essen; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena","Jueptner, M (corresponding author), Rhein Kliniken Essen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Virchowstr 174, D-45147 Essen, Germany.","markus.jueptner@uni-essen.de",,"Weiller, Cornelius/0000-0002-2448-5714",,,,,66,356,360,0,21,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","AUG",1998,121,,8,,,,1437,1449,,"10.1093/brain/121.8.1437","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.8.1437"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.8.1437"")",,,13,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","111BM",9712006,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000075417500005","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000075417500005"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In the current study we reveal features of the organization of the pulvinar complex in galagos by examining superior colliculus (SC) projections to this structure and comparing them with staining patterns of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT2. Cholera toxin subunit (CTB), Fluoro-ruby (FR), and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were placed in topographically different locations within the SC. Our results showed multiple topographically organized patterns of projections from the SC to several divisions of the pulvinar complex. At least two topographically distributed projections were found within the lateral region of the pulvinar complex, and two less obvious topographical projection patterns were found within the caudomedial region, in zones that stain darkly for VGLUT2. The results, considered in relation to recent observations in tree shrews and squirrels, suggest that parts of the organizational scheme of the pulvinar complex in primates are present in rodents and other mammals.

Twelve male subjects were selected for DSC perfusion MR imaging (age 4-8 years). The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) images were obtained by post-processing software. The values of rCBV and rCBF were recorded from the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, head of caudate nucleus, posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellar, semioval area and splenium of the corpus callosum. The figures of rCBV and rCBF can clearly demonstrate the hemodynamic differences in various cerebral parts. It has been noted that rCBV and rCBF values have no significant difference between the right and left hemisphere (P > 0.05). The values of rCBF from cerebral cortex were significantly higher than that of white matter (P < 0.05). The values of rCBF were different (P < 0.05) at frontal cortex, parietal cortex and occipital cortex. However, the highest value has been observed in occipital cortex compared with the others (P < 0.05). We observed higher correlation coefficient between the rCBF and rCBV (r = 0.92, P < 0.05). Results from this study show that the hemodynamic characteristics of healthy adult rhesus are similar to those of normal human studies. Moreover, the blood flow of cortex is found significantly higher than white matter and there was different flow perfusion among different parts, as the occipital cortex showed the highest value and frontal cortex the lowest value.","[Zhao, Xin-xiang; Yang, Fei-fei; Yang, Nan] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Radiol, Kunming 650101, Peoples R China; [Pu, Jun] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Neurosurg, Kunming 650101, Peoples R China; [He, Li-ping] Kunming Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Kunming 650101, Peoples R China","Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University","Pu, J (corresponding author), Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Neurosurg, Kunming 650101, Peoples R China.","pujun88@yeah.net",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [30960398, 81260213]; project of young and middle-aged high-level talents medical personnel training of science and technique of Yunnan Province [2015HB068]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); project of young and middle-aged high-level talents medical personnel training of science and technique of Yunnan Province","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30960398 and 81260213) and a project of young and middle-aged high-level talents medical personnel training of science and technique of Yunnan Province (2015HB068).",,21,0,0,1,6,"SPRINGER WIEN","WIEN","SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA","0937-9347","1613-7507",,"APPL MAGN RESON","Appl.

Spread of virus was followed by immunohistochemical demonstration of viral antigen in tissue sections of the peripheral and central nervous system. Three distinct patterns emerged: 1. After i.m. limb inoculations, virus progressed along the ipsilateral dorsal column, the bilateral spinothalamic and bilateral spinoreticular systems and along central autonomic pathways. 2. After s.c. inoculation, the dorsal column was spared, otherwise the spread was similar to that following i.m. inoculations. 3. After i.p. inoculation, virus spread in the spinal cord bilaterally, mainly along spinothalamic and central autonomic pathways. The peripheral motoneurons were conspicuously spared, even in the i.m. inoculation mode. In the brain stem, B virus antigen appeared bilaterally, at multiple sites.

The mode of spread from spinal levels was mainly orthograde along the ascending systems (dorsal columns, spinothalamic, spinoreticular tracts), but also retrograde along descending systems (pyramidal tract, central autonomic pathways). Oligosynaptic systems transmitted virus more quickly than the polysynaptic ones. In the involvement of various neuronal systems in virus spread, a certain selectivity, sparing the peripheral motoneuron and the cerebellar systems, could be assessed.","UNIV MAINZ,INST MED MIKROBIOL,EXPTL VIROL ABT,W-6500 MAINZ,GERMANY; FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST VIROL,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Free University of Berlin","GOSZTONYI, G (corresponding author), FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST NEUROPATHOL,HINDENBURGDAMM 30,W-1000 BERLIN 45,GERMANY.",,,,,,,,40,17,18,0,0,"F HERNANDEZ","MURCIA","PLAZA FUENSANTA 2-7 C, 30008 MURCIA, SPAIN","0213-3911",,,"HISTOL HISTOPATHOL","Histol.

In rodents V1 two ranges within the gamma band are sensitive to contrast: a broad gamma band (BB) increasing with contrast, and a narrow gamma band (NB), peaking at similar to 60 Hz, decreasing with contrast. The functional roles of the two bands and the neural circuits originating them are not completely clear yet. Here, we show, combining experimental and simulated data, that in mice V1 (1) BB carries information about high contrast and NB about low contrast; (2) BB modulation depends on excitatory-inhibitory interplay in the cortex, while NB modulation is because of entrainment to the thalamic drive. In awake mice presented with alternating gratings, NB power progressively decreased from low to intermediate levels of contrast where it reached a plateau. Conversely, BB power was constant across low levels of contrast, but it progressively increased from intermediate to high levels of contrast. Furthermore, BB response was stronger immediately after contrast reversal, while the opposite held for NB. These complementary modulations were reproduced by a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory leaky integrateand-fire network provided that the thalamic inputs were composed of a sustained and a periodic component having complementary sensitivity ranges. These results show that in rodents the thalamic-driven NB plays a specific key role in encoding visual contrast. Moreover, we propose a simple and effective network model of response to visual stimuli in rodents that might help in investigating network dysfunctions of pathologic visual information processing.","[Meneghetti, Nicolo; Mazzoni, Alberto] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Biorobot Inst, I-56025 Pisa, Italy; [Meneghetti, Nicolo; Mazzoni, Alberto] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Dept Excellence Robot & AI, I-56025 Pisa, Italy; [Cerri, Chiara; Tantillo, Elena; Vannini, Eleonora; Caleo, Matteo] Natl Res Council CNR, Neurosci Inst, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Cerri, Chiara; Vannini, Eleonora] Fdn Umberto Veronesi, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Cerri, Chiara] Univ Pisa, Dept Pharm, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Tantillo, Elena] Fdn Pisana Sci Onlus FPS, I-56017 Pisa, Italy; [Tantillo, Elena] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Caleo, Matteo] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Pisa; Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; ARQUS; University of Padua","Mazzoni, A (corresponding author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, Biorobot Inst, I-56025 Pisa, Italy.;Mazzoni, A (corresponding author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, Dept Excellence Robot & AI, I-56025 Pisa, Italy.","a.mazzoni@santannapisa.it","Mazzoni, Alberto/AGO-5998-2022","Mazzoni, Alberto/0000-0002-9632-1831; CALEO, MATTEO/0000-0002-4333-6378; cerri, chiara/0000-0001-9930-7931; Meneghetti, Nicolo/0000-0002-3466-0504; VANNINI, Eleonora/0000-0002-1337-3901","Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR) [20178L7WRS]","Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR) PRIN2017, PROTECTION, Project 20178L7WRS.",,99,4,4,3,8,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,"2373-2822",,"ENEURO","eNeuro","NOV-DEC",2021,8,6,,,,,,,"0106-21.2021","10.1523/ENEURO.0106-21.2021","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0106-21.2021"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0106-21.2021"")",,,21,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","WX9BT",34663617,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000718883900002","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000718883900002"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

Both similarities and differences were found. Maximal order of branching, branching angles, topological distribution of branches and boutons are similar for all axons, indicating strong constraints in arbor formation. CCC and MTC axons are indistinguishable for total arbor length and number of branches, although these parameters can vary across individual axons of each group. MTC axons have longer and bouton-richer end-branches (the 'transmission compartment') while, in CCC axons, proximal, boutonless branches (the 'conduction compartment') predominate. Therefore, the two classes of axons appear to he specialized for performing different types of operations, in agreement with the available electrophysiological data and computer simulations. Differences in the length of branches were also observed between MTC axons of normal and 'barrelless' mice, suggesting that this parameter can be regulated by conditions at the terminal sites.","Univ Lausanne, Inst Cell Biol & Morphol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Sect Neuroanat & Brain Dev, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden","University of Lausanne; Karolinska Institutet","Innocenti, GM (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Cell Biol & Morphol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.","Giorgio.Innocenti@neuro.ki.se",,,,,,,49,34,34,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

To determine whether a homologous metabolic pattern is also present in nonhuman primate models of parkinsonism, 11 adult macaque monkeys with parkinsonism secondary to chronic systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 12 age-matched healthy animals were scanned with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). A subgroup comprising five parkinsonian and six control animals was used to identify a parkinsonism-related pattern (PRP). For validation, analogous topographies were derived from other subsets of parkinsonian and control animals. The PRP topography was characterized by metabolic increases in putamen/pallidum, thalamus, pons, and sensorimotor cortex, as well as reductions in the posterior parietal-occipital region. Pattern expression was significantly elevated in parkinsonian relative to healthy animals (P < 0.00001). Parkinsonism-related topographies identified in the other derivation sets were very similar, with significant pairwise correlations of region weights (r> 0.88; P < 0.0001) and subject scores (r> 0.74; P < 0.01). Moreover, pattern expression in parkinsonian animals correlated with motor ratings (r> 0.71; P< 0.05). Thus, homologous parkinsonism-related metabolic networks are demonstrable in PD patients and in monkeys with experimental parkinsonism. Network quantification may provide a useful biomarker for the evaluation of new therapeutic agents in preclinical models of PD.

The authors examined the acute effects of propofol on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography in patients with severe depression. Methods: in six severely depressed patients (mean age, 55.0 yr) scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy, anesthetic levels were monitored by electroencephalography, and rCBF was serially quantified in the awake, sedated, and anesthetized states. The authors used high-resolution positron emission tomography with O-15-labeled water and statistical parametric mapping 99 for imaging and analysis of the data. Results. Global cerebral blood flow showed sharp decreases from the awake level during the administration of propofol, decreasing 26.8% in the sedated state and 54.4% in the anesthetized state. Moreover, a dose effect was seen in both parietal cortices and the left lateral prefromal region wit h larger regions of relative decrease in rCBF at higher propofol doses. At the higher dose, the values of rCBF in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, the pontine tegmentum, and the cerebellar cortex were also affected. Meanwhile, there were few changes of relative rCBF in the basal frontal lobes during both sedated and anesthetized states. Conclusions: As in earlier studies using normal subjects, pronounced suppression in rCBF in the brain stem reticular formation, the thalamus, and the parietal association cortex occurred even in severely depressed patients. However, previously reported decreases in rCBF in the basal frontal lobe were absent in depressed patients.","Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Tokyo, Japan","National Center for Neurology & Psychiatry - Japan","Ogawa, K (corresponding author), Yokohama City Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Sch Med, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan.",,"Imabayashi, Etsuko/GLR-4602-2022; Imabayashi, Etsuko/F-4057-2014","Imabayashi, Etsuko/0000-0003-1708-3618",,,,,40,10,12,0,4,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA","0003-3022",,,"ANESTHESIOLOGY","Anesthesiology","MAY",2003,98,5,,,,,1101,1111,,"10.1097/00000542-200305000-00012","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200305000-00012"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200305000-00012"")",,,11,"Anesthesiology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Anesthesiology","672LY",12717131,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000182523200011","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000182523200011"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","New York University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA","Shapley, R (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.","shapley@cns.nyu.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY01472, EY12816, EY83000] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,52,195,195,3,42,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0896-6273","1097-4199",,"NEURON","Neuron","JUN 5",2003,38,5,,,,,689,699,,"10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00332-5","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00332-5"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00332-5"")",,,11,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","687DU",12797955,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000183361400006","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000183361400006"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The effect of L-dopa has been demonstrated in language studies, suggesting restriction of the semantic network. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of L-dopa on language processing with fMRI using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Two types of language tasks (phonological and semantic categorization tasks) were tested under two drug conditions (placebo and L-dopa) in 16 healthy subjects. Probabilistic ICA (PICA), part of FSL, was implemented to generate Independent Components (IC) for each subject for the four conditions and the ICs were classified into task-relevant source groups by a correlation threshold criterion. Our key findings include: (i) The highly task-relevant brain regions including the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (LIFG), Left Fusiform Gyrus (LFUS), Left Parietal lobe (LPAR) and Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) were activated with both L-dopa and placebo for both tasks, and (ii) as compared to placebo, L-dopa was associated with increased activity in posterior regions, including the superior temporal area (BA 22), and decreased activity in the thalamus (pulvinar) and inferior frontal gyrus (BA 11/47) for both tasks.

Moreover, it provides an aesthetic component to visual experiences that is fundamental to our perception of the world. Despite the long history of colour vision studies, much has still to be learned about the physiological basis of colour perception. Recent advances in our understanding of the early processing in the retina and thalamus have enabled us to take a fresh look at cortical processing of colour. These studies are beginning to indicate that colour is processed not in isolation, but together with information about luminance and visual form, by the same neural circuits, to achieve a unitary and robust representation of the visual world.","Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany","Justus Liebig University Giessen","Gegenfurtner, KR (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.","gegenfurtner@uni-giessen.de",,"Gegenfurtner, Karl/0000-0001-5390-0684",,,,,121,254,256,1,84,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","1471-003X","1471-0048",,"NAT REV NEUROSCI","Nat.

However, as response properties of the mechanoreceptive afferent fibers supplying the skin have not been characterized for this primate, the present study was undertaken to classify fibers innervating the glabrous skin of the marmoset hand and determine whether they resembled those described for other mammalian species, including cat, macaque monkey, and human subjects. Forty-seven tactile afferent fibers with receptive fields (RFs) on the glabrous skin of the hand were isolated in fine median and ulnar nerve strands. Controlled tactile stimuli, including static indentation and skin vibration, were used to classify fibers. Twenty-six (55%) responded to static indentation in a sustained manner and were designated slowly adapting (SA) fibers, while 21 (45%) were selectively sensitive to the dynamic components of the stimulus. The SA fibers had well-defined boundaries to their RFs, lacked spontaneous activity in most cases (23/26 fibers), had an irregular pattern of discharge to static skin indentation, and displayed graded response levels as a function of indentation amplitude, attributes that were consistent with the properties of slowly adapting type I (SAI) fibers described in other species. The dynamically sensitive afferent fibers could be subdivided into two distinct functional classes, based on their responses to vibrotactile stimulation. The majority (15/21) responded best to lower frequency vibration (similar to 10-50 Hz) and had small RFs, whereas the second class responded preferentially to higher frequency vibration (50-700 Hz) with maximal sensitivity at similar to 200-300 Hz. These two classes resembled, respectively, the rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian corpuscle-related (PC) fiber classes found in other species, and like them, responded to vibration with tightly phase-locked patterns of response over a wide range of frequencies. The results demonstrate that the functional classes of tactile afferent fibers that supply the glabrous skin in the marmoset monkey appear to correspond with those described previously for the cat and macaque monkey, and are similar to those supplying the human hand and fingers, although the SA fibers in the human hand appear to fall into two classes, the SAI and SAII fibers. With the increasing use of the marmoset monkey as a primate model for somatosensory system studies, these data now allow tactile neurons identified at central locations, such as the cerebral cortex and thalamus, to be classified in relation to inputs from the peripheral classes identified in the present study.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","University of New South Wales Sydney","Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,,,,,,69,25,25,0,9,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

We injected rabies into the primary motor cortex (M1) or into Area 46 of cebus monkeys. A 4-day survival time was long enough to allow transport of rabies from the injection site to 'third-order' neurons in the basal ganglia. After either MI or Area 46 injections, third-order neurons were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). In each of these nuclei, the third-order neurons that innervate M1 were spatially separated from those that innervate Area 46. Thus, distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits innervate M1 and Area 46. Next, we injected a conventional tracer into M1 to define its terminations in the putamen and STN. We found that the regions of the putamen and STN that receive input from M1 are the same as those that contain third-order neurons after M1 injections of virus. On the other hand, virus injections into M1 also labeled a relatively dense group of third-order neurons in a region of the ventral putamen that is not innervated by M1. This region of the putamen is the target of efferents from the amygdala. Thus, the ventral putamen may provide a route for the limbic system to influence motor output. Overall, our results indicate that basal ganglia circuits with the cerebral cortex can be characterized by both open- and closed-loop macro-architectures.","Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Res & Dev, San Diego, CA 92121 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA","Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.","strickp@pitt.edu",,,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH 56661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 24328] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,43,165,166,0,16,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"0-444-51389-2","PROG BRAIN RES","Prog.

The regional distribution pattern of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 at 60-91 min postinjection was the highest in the cingulate gyrus and hippocampus, high in the frontal and temporal cortices, lower in the occipital cortex, striatum, thalamus, and raphe nuclei, and lowest in the cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. Graphical Logan plot analysis with metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity as an input function into the brain was applied to evaluate 5-HT1A receptor binding in vivo. Significant age-related decreases in 5-HT1A receptor binding were observed only in the frontal and temporal cortices. In the hippocampus, although 5-HT1A receptor binding indicated no significant age-related changes, it showed an inverse correlation with individual cortisol levels in plasma. When the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg 30 min after tracer injection, binding of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 was displaced in both age groups in a dose-dependent manner. However, the degree of displacement was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. These observations demonstrated the usefulness of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 as an indicator of the age-related changes in cortical 5-HT1A receptors measured noninvasively by PET. In addition, these observations suggested that the age-related impairment of 5-HT1A receptor responses to 8-OH-DPAT might be related to the reduced efficacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly patients with depression.

Spike trains from sensory cortex neurons can predict trial-to-trial variability in choice. Choice-related spiking is widely studied as a way to link cortical activity to perception, but its origins remain unclear. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we found that mouse primary somatosensory cortex neurons showed robust choice-related activity during a tactile detection task. Spike trains from primary mechanoreceptive neurons did not predict choices about identical stimuli. Spike trains from thalamic relay neurons showed highly transient, weak choice-related activity. Intracellular recordings in cortex revealed a prolonged choice-related depolarization in most neurons that was not accounted for by feed-forward thalamic input. Top-down axons projecting from secondary to primary somatosensory cortex signaled choice. An intracellular measure of stimulus sensitivity determined which neurons converted choice-related depolarization into spiking. Our results reveal how choice-related spiking emerges across neural circuits and within single neurons.","[Yang, Hongdian; Kwon, Sung E.; Severson, Kyle S.; O'Connor, Daniel H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Yang, Hongdian; Kwon, Sung E.; Severson, Kyle S.; O'Connor, Daniel H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Brain Sci Inst, Baltimore, MD USA","Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University","O'Connor, DH (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","dan.oconnor@jhmi.edu",,"Severson, Kyle/0000-0002-7910-6304; O'Connor, Daniel/0000-0002-9193-6714","Whitehall Foundation; Klingenstein Fund; US National Institutes of Health [R01NS089652, P30NS050274]","Whitehall Foundation; Klingenstein Fund(Klingenstein Philanthropies); US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","We thank V.

It is suggested that an outside-in neurogenetic gradient (in which early-generated cells are located more superficially than late-generated cells), as occurs in reptilian cortex, would have positioned the late-produced, associative neurons (destined to supragranular layers in modern isocortex) below the early-produced output neurons. This may have limited the possibilities of synaptic contacts between the younger cells and the afferent terminals which were located in the more superficial layer I. There was probably an adaptive benefit in those individuals in which rate-produced cells were capable of passing through the layers of already migrated cells, thus making contacts with superficial afferents and generating corticocortical and local circuits that processed the information before producing an output. Reelin, an extracellular glycoprotein found in layer I, and a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5) and its neuronal-specific activator (p35) may have played key roles in the generation of the inside-out gradient. Additionally, by serving as a waiting compartment for thalamic axons while the cortical plate develops, the subplate zone may have participated in the change from an emphasis in a tangential arrangement of thalamic terminals that is characteristic of reptilian cortex to the predominantly radial mode of termination that is observed in mammalian isocortex.","Univ Chile, Fac Med, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Programa Morfol, Santiago 07, Chile","Universidad de Chile","Aboitiz, F (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Med, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Programa Morfol, 1027 Independendencia Ave,POB 70079, Santiago 07, Chile.","faboitiz@machi.med.uchile.cl","Aboitiz, Francisco/A-1016-2008",,,,,,76,31,32,0,2,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Based on neurobiological research, it is generally accepted that most forms of tinnitus are attributable to maladaptive plasticity due to damage to auditory system. Changes have been observed in auditory structures such as the inferior colliculus, the thalamus and the auditory cortex as well as in non-auditory brain areas. However, the observed changes show great variability, hence lacking a conclusive picture. One of the reasons might be the selection of inhomogeneous groups in data analysis. Methodology: The aim of the present study was to delineate the differences between the neural networks involved in narrow band noise and pure tone tinnitus conducting LORETA based source analysis of resting state EEG. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that narrow band noise tinnitus patients differ from pure tone tinnitus patients in the lateral frontopolar (BA 10), PCC and the parahippocampal area for delta, beta and gamma frequency bands, respectively. The parahippocampal-PCC current density differences might be load dependent, as noise-like tinnitus constitutes multiple frequencies in contrast to pure tone tinnitus. The lateral frontopolar differences might be related to pitch specific memory retrieval.","[Vanneste, Sven; Plazier, Mark; van der Loo, Elsa; Van de Heyning, Paul; De Ridder, Dirk] Univ Antwerp Hosp, TRI, Edegem, Belgium; [Vanneste, Sven; Plazier, Mark; van der Loo, Elsa; De Ridder, Dirk] Univ Antwerp Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Edegem, Belgium; [Van de Heyning, Paul] Univ Antwerp Hosp, ENT, Edegem, Belgium","University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp","Vanneste, S (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp Hosp, TRI, Edegem, Belgium.","sven.vanneste@ua.ac.be","Plazier, Mark/ISS-3944-2023; Heyning, Paul H Vande/I-8278-2017","Heyning, Paul H Vande/0000-0002-8424-3717; Vanneste, Sven/0000-0003-1513-5752","Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI)","Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI)","This research was supported by a grant of the Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI).

This paper briefly reviews some of these findings and provides a personal interpretation of their possible functional significance. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus have multiple representations in the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, namely the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. It is hypothesized that this multiple representation serves as a means of amplifying and diversifying the striatal and subthalamic influences upon thalamocortical neurons that is mediated through the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. Furthermore, evidence for the highly ordered organization of the striatopallidal and subthalamo-pallidal projections, which converge onto single pallidal neurons according to different but highly specific patterns, is taken as an indication that the subthalamic nucleus uniformly excites a vast collection of pallidal neurons, whereas the striatum exerts a more specific inhibitory control upon selected subsets of subthalamically driven pallidal neurons.",,,"PARENT, A (corresponding author), UNIV LAVAL, FAC MED, NEUROBIOL RES CTR, QUEBEC CITY G1K 7P4, QUEBEC, CANADA.",,"hazrati, lili-naz/AAE-7785-2020","hazrati, lili-naz/0000-0003-2715-1485",,,,,36,167,168,0,6,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON","LONDON","84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND","0166-2236","1878-108X",,"TRENDS NEUROSCI","Trends Neurosci.","MAR",1993,16,3,,,,,111,116,,"10.1016/0166-2236(93)90135-9","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-2236(93)90135-9"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-2236(93)90135-9"")",,,6,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","KN179",7681234,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993KN17900008","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993KN17900008"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

This study investigated the biodistribution of a serotonin transporter imaging agent, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-F-18-fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM), in nonhuman primate brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Six and four Macaca cyclopis monkeys were used to determine the transit time (i.e., time necessary to reach biodistribution equilibrium) and the reproducibility of 4-[F-18]-ADAM biodistribution in the brain, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding to SERT were evaluated in one monkey challenged with different doses of fluoxetine and one monkey treated with 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Dynamic PET imaging was performed for 3 h after 4-[F-18]-ADAM intravenous bolus injection. The specific uptake ratios (SURs) in the midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST) and frontal cortex (FC) were calculated. Results: The distribution of 4-[F-18]-ADAM reached equilibrium 120-150 min after injection. The mean SURs were 2.49 +/- 0.13 in MB, 1.59 +/- 0.17 in TH, 1.35 +/- 0.06 in ST and 0.34 +/- 0.03 in FC, and the minimum variability was shown 120-150 min after 4-[F-18]-ADAM injection. Using SURs and intraclass coefficient of correlation, the test/retest variability was under 8% and above 0.8, respectively, in SERT-rich areas. Challenge with fluoxetin (0.75-2 mg) dose-dependently inhibited the SURs in various brain regions. 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding was markedly reduced in the brain of an MDMA-treated monkey compared to that in brains of normal controls. Conclusion: 4-[F-18]-ADAM appears to be a highly selective radioligand for imaging SERT in monkey brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Lnc.

Aromatase has been reported to be involved in aggressive behaviours in genetically modified mice and in personality traits by genotyping studies on humans. However, no study has investigated the relationship between aromatase in living brains and personality traits including aggression. We performed a positron emission tomography (PET) study in 21 healthy subjects using C-cetrozole, which has high selectivity and affinity for aromatase. Before performing PET scans, subjects answered the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Temperament and Character Inventory to measure their aggression and personality traits, respectively. A strong accumulation of C-cetrozole was detected in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and medulla. Females showed associations between aromatase levels in subcortical regions, such as the amygdala and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and personality traits such as aggression, novelty seeking, and self-transcendence. In contrast, males exhibited associations between aromatase levels in the cortices and harm avoidance, persistence, and self-transcendence. The association of aromatase levels in the thalamus with cooperativeness was common to both sexes. The present study suggests that there might exist associations between aromatase in the brain and personality traits. Some of these associations may differ between sexes, while others are likely common to both.","[Takahashi, Kayo; Hosoya, Takamitsu; Onoe, Kayo; Takashima, Tadayuki; Tazawa, Shusaku; Takahashi, Kazuhiro; Doi, Hisashi; Wada, Yasuhiro; Watanabe, Yasuyoshi] RIKEN, Ctr Life Sci Technol, Chuo Ku, 6-7-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Takahashi, Kayo; Hosoya, Takamitsu; Onoe, Kayo; Doi, Hisashi; Wada, Yasuhiro; Watanabe, Yasuyoshi] RIKEN, Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res, Chuo Ku, 6-7-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Takahashi, Kayo; Tanaka, Masaaki; Ishii, Akira; Nakatomi, Yasuhito; Wada, Yasuhiro; Watanabe, Yasuyoshi] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Abeno Ku, 1-4-3 Asahi Cho, Osaka 5458585, Japan; [Hosoya, Takamitsu] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Inst Biomat & Bioengn, Chiyoda Ku, 2-3-10 Kanda Surugadai, Tokyo 1010062, Japan; [Nakatomi, Yasuhito] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Metab Endocrinol & Mol Med, Abeno Ku, 1-4-3 Asahi Cho, Osaka 5458585, Japan","RIKEN; RIKEN; Osaka Metropolitan University; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); Osaka Metropolitan University","Watanabe, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN, Ctr Life Sci Technol, Chuo Ku, 6-7-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.;Watanabe, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN, Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res, Chuo Ku, 6-7-3 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.;Watanabe, Y (corresponding author), Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Abeno Ku, 1-4-3 Asahi Cho, Osaka 5458585, Japan.","yywata@riken.jp","Hosoya, Takamitsu/N-7762-2015; Doi, Hisashi/N-5412-2015; Takahashi, Kayo/AIF-0996-2022","Hosoya, Takamitsu/0000-0002-7270-351X; Doi, Hisashi/0000-0001-9778-5841; ","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; JSPS KAKENHI [22791155, 25830024]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25830024, 22791155] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Ms. Yumiko Katayama and Ms. Kanako Tajima of the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies and Dr. Naohiro Tsuyuguchi, Mr. Takashi Yamanaga, Mr. Hideki Kawahata, and Dr. Hisako Kobata of Osaka City University for their expert technical assistance and Prof. Sanae Fukuda of Kansai University of Welfare Sciences for her support in participant recruitment.

This region is commonly implicated in higher cognitive functions. Despite the histological distinctiveness of primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the work of Rose, Woolsey, and Akert produced a broad consensus among neuroscientists that homologues of primate granular frontal cortex exist in nonprimates and can be recognized by their dense innervation from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD). Additional characteristics have come to be identified with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including rich dopaminergic innervation and involvement in spatial delayed-reaction tasks. However, recent studies reveal that these characteristics are not distinctive of the dorsolateral prefrontal region in primates: MD and dopaminergic projections are widespread in the frontal lobe, and medial and orbital frontal areas may play a role in delay tasks. A reevaluation of rat frontal cortex suggests that the medial frontal cortex, usually considered to be homologous to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates, actually consists of cortex homologous to primate premotor and anterior cingulate cortex. The lateral MD-projection cortex of rats resembles portions of primate orbital cortex. If prefrontal cortex is construed broadly enough to include orbital and cingulate cortex, rats can be said to have prefrontal cortex. However, they evidently lack homologues of the dorsolateral prefrontal areas of primates. This assessment suggests that rats probably do not provide useful models of human dorsolateral frontal lobe function and dysfunction, although they might prove valuable for understanding other regions of frontal cortex.",,,"PREUSS, TM (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, 301 WILSON HALL, NASHVILLE, TN 37240 USA.",,"Preuss, Todd/GSI-6571-2022",,,,,,196,499,506,1,17,"MIT PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA","0898-929X","1530-8898",,"J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI","J.

To gain more information on the temporal distribution of SERTs, 2-([2-([dimethylamino]methyl)phenoxyl]thio)-5-[I-123] iodophenylamine (I-123-ADAM) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was utilized in an in vivo imaging study using non-human primates. Methods Two female monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were studied. Eight brain SPECT imaging examinations, each 30 min in duration, were obtained after injection of (185) MBq of I-123-ADAM. Images were obtained using a dual-head gamma camera equipped with ultra-high resolution fan-beam collimators. In addition to visual inspection, the radio-uptake and specific uptake ratios (SURs) of midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST), temporal and frontal cortices and the whole brain in reference to the corresponding magnetic resonance image at the eight time points were measured. The SUR of MB, using cerebellum (CB) as the reference tissue, was calculated as (MB-CB)/CB, in mean counts/pixel. The SURs of the other brain regions were similarly measured. Results There was relatively high uptake of I-123-ADAM in the MB and TH, moderate uptake in ST, lower uptake in the cerebral cortex, and almost no uptake in the CB. The image of MB could be easily identified at the first 30 min time point. It appeared that the SURs of MB, TH and ST reached equilibrium around 210 min after injection. No adverse reactions of the primates were found during and after imaging. Brain distribution of I-123-ADAM in the primate appeared consistent with the known distribution of SERTs.

In striatal slices of naive rodents, N/OFQ (0.1-1 mu M) prevented the increase of ERK phosphorylation and the loss of depotentiation of synaptic plasticity induced by the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 in spiny neurons. In vivo, exogenous N/OFQ (0.03-1 nmol, i.c.v.) or a synthetic N/OFQ receptor agonist given systemically (0.01-1 mg/Kg) attenuated dyskinesias expression in 6-hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats primed with L-DOPA, without causing primary hypolocomotive effects. Conversely, N/OFQ receptor antagonists worsened dyskinesia expression. In vivo microdialysis revealed that N/OFQ prevented dyskinesias simultaneously with its neurochemical correlates such as the surge of nigral GABA and glutamate, and the reduction of thalamic GABA. Regional microinjections revealed that N/OFQ attenuated dyskinesias more potently and effectively when microinjected in striatum than substantia nigra (SN) reticulata, whereas N/OFQ receptor antagonists were ineffective in striatum but worsened dyskinesias when given in SN. Quantitative autoradiography showed an increase in N/OFQ receptor binding in striatum and a reduction in SN of both unprimed and dyskinetic 6-hydroxydopamine rats, consistent with opposite adaptive changes of N/OFQ transmission. Finally, the N/OFQ receptor synthetic agonist also reduced dyskinesia expression in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated dyskinetic macaques without affecting the global parkinsonian score. We conclude that N/OFQ receptor agonists may represent a novel strategy to counteract L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Their action is possibly mediated by upregulated striatal N/OFQ receptors opposing the D1 receptor-mediated overactivation of the striatonigral direct pathway.","[Marti, Matteo; Rodi, Donata; Simonato, Michele; Morari, Michele] Univ Ferrara, Pharmacol Sect, Dept Expt & Clin Med, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Marti, Matteo; Rodi, Donata; Simonato, Michele; Morari, Michele] Natl Inst Neurosci, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Li, Qin; Bezard, Erwan] China Acad Med Sci, Inst Lab Anim Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Guerrini, Remo] Univ Ferrara, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy; [Fasano, Stefania; Morella, Ilaria; Brambilla, Riccardo] San Raffaele Sci Inst & Univ, Div Neurosci, Inst Expt Neurol, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Tozzi, Alessandro; Calabresi, Paolo] Univ Perugia, Osped Santa Maria della Misericordia, Dip Special Med Chirurg & Sanita Pubbl, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Tozzi, Alessandro; Calabresi, Paolo] Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Fdn Santa Lucia, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Bezard, Erwan] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, UMR 5293, F-33000 Bordeaux, France; [Bezard, Erwan] CNRS, Inst Malad Neurodegenerat, UMR 5293, F-33000 Bordeaux, France","University of Ferrara; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Laboratory Animal Science - CAMS; University of Ferrara; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia; University of Perugia; IRCCS Santa Lucia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux","Morari, M (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Pharmacol Sect, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Via Fossato Mortara 17-19, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.","m.morari@unife.it","Calabresi, Paolo/G-8496-2011; Tozzi, Alessandro/G-7254-2011; Marti, Matteo/AAT-5974-2020; Bezard, Erwan/ABD-5153-2021; Brambilla, Riccardo/A-6082-2010; Bezard, Erwan/A-8173-2008; Tozzi, Alessandro/AAB-8707-2022; Simonato, Michele/AIA-0028-2022","Calabresi, Paolo/0000-0003-0326-5509; Marti, Matteo/0000-0001-8751-2882; Bezard, Erwan/0000-0002-0410-4638; Simonato, Michele/0000-0002-3586-2693; Guerrini, Remo/0000-0002-7619-0918; Tozzi, Alessandro/0000-0003-3153-2424; Fasano, Stefania/0000-0002-3696-7139; Morella, Ilaria/0000-0001-5691-5400; Brambilla, Riccardo/0000-0003-3569-5706","Italian Ministry of the University [RBIN047W33, 2008EJ85RS]; Italian Ministry of Health; Parkinson&apos;s UK [G-1001] Funding Source: researchfish","Italian Ministry of the University(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy); Parkinson&apos;s UK(Parkinson&apos;s UK)","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of the University (FIRB n.

Neuroimaging studies using both galvanic and caloric stimulation have shown that several distinct cortical and subcortical structures can be activated during vestibular information processing. The insular cortex has been often targeted and presented as the central hub of the vestibular cortical system. Since very short pulses of cold water ear irrigation can generate a strong and prolonged vestibular response and a nystagmus, we explored the effects of this type of caloric stimulation for assessing the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) dynamics of neural vestibular processing in a whole-brain event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. We evaluated the spatial layout and the temporal dynamics of the activated cortical and subcortical regions in time-locking with the instant of injection and were able to extract a robust pattern of neural activity involving the contra-lateral insular cortex, the thalamus, the brainstem and the cerebellum. No significant correlation with the temporal envelope of the nystagmus was found. The temporal analysis of the activation profiles highlighted a significantly longer duration of the evoked BOLD activity in the brainstem compared to the insular cortex suggesting a functional de-coupling between cortical and subcortical activity during the vestibular response.

The nexus of auditory activity is located in temporal cortex among several specialized areas, or fields, that receive dense inputs from the medial geniculate complex. These areas are collectively referred to as auditory cortex. Auditory activity is extended beyond auditory cortex via connections with auditory-related areas elsewhere in the cortex. Within this network, information flows between areas to and from countless targets, but in a manner that is characterized by orderly regional, areal and laminar patterns. These patterns reflect some of the structural constraints that passively govern the flow of information at all levels of the network. In addition, the exchange of information within these circuits is dynamically regulated by intrinsic neurochemical properties of projecting neurons and their targets. This article begins with an overview of the principal circuits and how each is related to information flow along major axes of the network. The discussion then turns to a description of neurochemical gradients along these axes, highlighting recent work on glutamate transporters in the thalamocortical projections to auditory cortex. The article concludes with a brief discussion of relevant neurophysiological findings as they relate to structural gradients in the network. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Jakob discussed the connectivity between the cerebellum and mesencephalic, diencephalic, and telencephalic structures in an evolutionary, developmental, and histophysiological perspective. He proposed three evolutionary morphofunctional stages, the archicerebellar, paleocerebellar, and neocerebellar; he attributed the reduced cerebellospinal connections in humans, compared to other primates, to the perfection of the rubrolenticular and thalamocortical systems and the intense ascending pathways to the red nucleus in exchange for the more elementary descending efferent pathways. Jakob hypothesized the convergence of cerebellar pathways in associative cortical regions, insisting on the intimate collaboration of the cerebellum with the frontal lobe. The extensive lines of communication between regions throughout the association cortex substantiate Jakob's intuition and begin to outline the mechanisms for substantial cerebellar involvement in functions beyond the purely motor domain. Atop a foundation of anatomical and phylogenetic mastery, Jakob conceived ideas that were noteworthy, timely, and have much relevance to our current thinking on cerebellar structure and function.","[Tzouma, Anny; Triarhou, Lazaros C.] Univ Macedonia, Grad Program Neurosci & Educ, 156 Egnatia Ave, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Margulies, Daniel S.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Res Grp Neuroanat & Connect, Stephanstr 1A, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Triarhou, Lazaros C.] Univ Macedonia, Lab Theoret & Appl Neurosci, 156 Egnatia Ave, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece","University of Macedonia; Max Planck Society; University of Macedonia","Triarhou, LC (corresponding author), Univ Macedonia, Grad Program Neurosci & Educ, 156 Egnatia Ave, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.;Triarhou, LC (corresponding author), Univ Macedonia, Lab Theoret & Appl Neurosci, 156 Egnatia Ave, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.","triarhou@uom.gr","Triarhou, Lazaros/ABE-4651-2020; Margulies, Daniel/L-4719-2016","Margulies, Daniel/0000-0002-8880-9204",,,,,96,0,0,1,6,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1473-4222","1473-4230",,"CEREBELLUM","Cerebellum","AUG",2016,15,4,,,,,417,424,,"10.1007/s12311-016-0791-z","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12311-016-0791-z"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12311-016-0791-z"")",,,8,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","DV4XG",27230900,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000382928400003","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000382928400003"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

These regions, referred to as IPS1-4, show similar functional responses to the mapping tasks used to define them, yet differing responses to tests of other posterior parietal cortex (PPC) functions such as short-term memory, eye movements and object viewing, suggesting that they may have distinct patterns of structural connectivity to other parts of the brain. The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mapping with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to describe white matter connections of visuotopic regions along the IPS, in 25 neurotypical young-adult participants. We found that posterior IPS more likely connects to retinotopically defined visual regions, and superior temporal gyrus, relative to anterior IPS. Anterior IPS regions 3 and 4 had higher connection probabilities to prefrontal regions, relative to posterior IPS. All four IPS regions showed inter-hemispheric connections to analogous regions in the opposite hemisphere, as well as consistent connections to the thalamus and regions of the striatum. Multivariate pattern classification at the group level reliably distinguished IPS regions from one another on the basis of connectivity patterns, especially for the most distal pairs of regions; occipital and prefrontal regions provided the most discriminating information. These findings advance our understanding of the structure of visuotopic IPS, with implications for functional differences between regions, and possible homologies between humans and macaques. Visuospatial functions dependent on the parietal cortex are frequently impaired in individuals with developmental disorders and those afflicted by cerebrovascular disease; the findings described here can be used as a basis for comparing connectivity differences in these populations.

Given this limitation, our approach is to construct the maximum noise entropy response function of the system, leading to a closed-form and minimally biased model consistent with a given set of constraints on the input/output moments; the result is equivalent to conditional random field models from machine learning. For systems with binary outputs, such as neurons encoding sensory stimuli, the maximum noise entropy models are logistic functions whose arguments depend on the constraints. A constraint on the average output turns the binary maximum noise entropy models into minimum mutual information models, allowing for the calculation of the information content of the constraints and an information theoretic characterization of the system's computations. We use this approach to analyze the nonlinear input/output functions in macaque retina and thalamus; although these systems have been previously shown to be responsive to two input dimensions, the functional form of the response function in this reduced space had not been unambiguously identified. A second order model based on the logistic function is found to be both necessary and sufficient to accurately describe the neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, accounting for an average of 93% of the mutual information with a small number of parameters. Thus, despite the fact that the stimulus is highly non-Gaussian, the vast majority of the information in the neural responses is related to first and second order correlations. Our results suggest a principled and unbiased way to model multidimensional computations and determine the statistics of the inputs that are being encoded in the outputs.","[Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sincich, Lawrence C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Francisco","Fitzgerald, JD (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","sharpee@salk.edu","Sharpee, Tatyana O/E-8663-2010","Sharpee, Tatyana/0000-0002-7483-5081","NIH [EY019493]; NSF [IIS-0712852, PHY-0822283]; Searle Funds; Alfred P.

[I-125]alpha-Btx binds throughout the normal monkey brain, with the greatest density in the thalamic nuclei and with moderate to low binding in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra. Chronic adminstration of low doses of MPTP resulted in animals with stable cognitive deficits without overt parkinsonian motor symptoms. [ 125]a-Btx binding in the brains of these animals was significantly increased in the outermost layers of the supplementary motor cortex (area 6M, similar to50%), primary motor cortex (area 4, similar to112%) and throughout the putamen (similar to50-72%). In contrast, there was no change in [I-125]alpha-btx binding in the brain regions thought to be involved in mediating the cognitive functions impaired in these monkeys (e.g., the hippocampus, areas 9/46D and 46D of the principal sulcus, and area 24c of the cingulate sulcus). Animals with cognitive dysfunction that received escalating doses of MPTP for >6 months developed motor signs of parkinsonism which were indistinguishable from those seen in animals rendered acutely parkinsonian with short term administration of large doses of MPTP. These two motor symptomatic groups had significantly increased [1251] a-btx binding only in the dorsolateral putamen. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the increased [I-125]alpha-btx binding, when observed, was associated with enhanced immunohistochemical staining localized to neurons and was not a result of an astrocytic response to MPTP. These results suggest that the increase in 0 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression in the chronic low-dose MPTP treated, motor asymptomatic monkeys may be a part of compensatory processes contributing to the maintained motor functioning in these animals.

Based on evidence that some neurological disorders correspond to linear instabilities, we hypothesize that stability constrains the brain's electrical activity and influences its structure and physiology. Using a physiologically-based model of brain electrical activity, we investigated the stability and dispersion solutions of networks of neuronal populations with propagation time delays and dendritic time constants. We find that stability is determined by the spectrum of the network's matrix of connection strengths and is independent of the temporal damping rate of axonal propagation with stability restricting the spectrum to a region in the complex plane. Time delays and dendritic time constants modify the shape of this region but it always contains the unit disk. Instabilities resulting from changes in connection strength initially have frequencies less than a critical frequency. For physiologically plausible parameter values based on the corticothalamic system, this critical frequency is approximately 10 Hz. For excitatory networks and networks with randomly distributed excitatory and inhibitory connections, time delays and non-zero dendritic time constants have no impact on network stability but do effect dispersion frequencies. Random networks with both excitatory and inhibitory connections can have multiple marginally stable modes at low delta frequencies.","[Gray, Richard T.] Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Robinson, Peter A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Robinson, Peter A.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch Western, Brain Dynam Ctr, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia","University of New South Wales Sydney; Kirby Institute; University of Sydney; University of Sydney","Gray, RT (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Kirby Inst, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.","rgray@kirby.unsw.edu.au",,"Robinson, Peter/0000-0002-5050-9804; Gray, Richard/0000-0002-2885-0483",,,,,84,8,8,0,18,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,"1662-5188",,"FRONT COMPUT NEUROSC","Front.

Connectivity patterns of these regions may inform on mechanisms of action for DBS of these targets. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography were performed in 13 nondepressed subjects to determine connectivity patterns of SCCwm and ALIC. Tract maps were generated for each target in each subject, and tract voxels were coded as being unique to either target or shared. Group level tract maps were generated by including only those voxels common to at least 10 of 13 (>75%) subjects. Results: The two targets have distinct patterns of connectivity with regions of overlap. The SCCwm showed consistent ipsilateral connections to the medial frontal cortex, the full extent of the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial temporal lobe, dorsal medial thalamus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and the dorsal brainstem. The ALIC seed, in contrast, demonstrated widespread projections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Common to both targets, albeit through distinct white matter bundles, were connections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, nucleus accumbens, dorsal thalamus, and hypothalamus. Conclusions: Connectivity patterns of these two DBS white matter targets suggest distinct neural networks with areas of overlap in regions implicated in depression and antidepressant response.","[Gutman, David A.; Holtzheimer, Paul E.; Mayberg, Helen S.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Behrens, Timothy E.

After Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into the PNC, the majority (70%) of anterogradely labeled terminals was localized in the pulvinar proper, the remaining 30% were scattered in the lateral and medial portions of the LP. No PNC neuron retrogradely labeled from the pulvinar was found to also express glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA, although a large number of neurons carrying the GAD label were found in close vicinity. In contrast, 69% of retrogradely labeled PNC cells also displayed glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Twenty-six out of 96 (27%) visually responsive pulvinar neurons were orthodromically activated by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral PNC at latencies between 1 and 10 ms (median 1.9 ms). All orthodromically activated neurons responded well to the onset and offset of large visual stimuli and to sudden stimulus shifts. Whenever a saccadic eye movement was executed, these neurons were also activated, except during saccades in darkness. The comparison of saccade-evoked response with responses to visual stimuli that elicit similar retinal image shifts revealed that pretectorecipient pulvinar neurons also seem to receive a saccade-related non-visual input. All response properties correspond to those of a specific class of pulvinar neurons that have been termed SV neurons because they respond to visual stimulation as well as during saccades. They also closely resemble response properties of PNC neurons that project to the ipsilateral pulvinar. The results support the proposal that PNC cells not only directly activate their postsynaptic target neurons in the pulvinar, but that they also provide a visual input to these neurons that greatly contributes to their response characteristics.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum","Schmidt, M (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, ND 6-25, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.","mschmidt@neurobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de",,,,,,,39,13,13,0,0,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

We investigated visuomotor performance in a 31 year old patient (M.B.) with a lesion centered on the medial portion of the dorsal pulvinar (left > right) due to an atypical Sarcoidosis manifestation. Unlike lesions with a vascular etiology, the lesion of M.B. did not include primary sensory or motor thalamic nuclei. Thus, this patient gave us the exceedingly rare opportunity to study the contribution of the dorsal pulvinar to visuomotor behavior in a human without confounding losses in primary sensory or motor domains. We investigated reaching, saccade and visual decision making performance. Patient data in each task was compared to at least seven age matched healthy controls. While saccades were hypometric towards both hemifields, the patient did not show any spatial choice bias or perceptual deficits. At the same time, he exhibited reach and grasp difficulties, which shared features with both, parietal and cerebellar damage. In particular, he had problems to form a precision grip and exhibited reach deficits expressed in decreased accuracy, delayed initiation and prolonged movement durations. Reach deficits were similar in foveal and extrafoveal viewing conditions and in both visual hemifields but were stronger with the right hand. These results suggest that dorsal pulvinar function in humans goes beyond its subscribed role in visual cognition and is critical for the programming of voluntary actions with the hands.

Patients were studied in three conditions, (a) before MCS (Baseline, stimulator stopped 4 weeks before), (b) during a 35-min period of MCS and (c) during a 75-min period after MCS had been discontinued (OFF). Compared to Baseline, turning on the stimulator was associated with CBF increase in the contralateral (anterior) midcingulate cortex (aMCC, BA24 and 32) and in the dorso-lateral prefrontal (BA10) cortices. The most important changes of CBF were observed in the 75 min after discontinuation of MCS (OFF). This post-stimulation period was associated with CBF increases in a large set of cortical and subcortical regions (from posterior MCC (pMCC) to pregenual (pg) ACC, orbitufrontal cortex, putamen, thalami, posterior cingulate and prefrontal areas) and in the brainstem (mesencephalon/periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pons). CBF changes in the post-stimulation period correlated with pain relief. Functional connectivity analysis showed significant correlation between pgACC and PAG, basal ganglia, and lower pons activities, supporting the activation of descending ACC-to-PAG connections. MCS may act in part through descending (top-down) inhibitory controls that involve prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ACC as well as basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem. These hemodynamic changes are lengthened and might therefore underlie the long-lasting clinical effects that largely outlast the actual stimulation periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To date, only certain vocal learning species show this behaviour spontaneously. Prior research training macaques (vocal non-learners) to tap to an auditory or visual metronome found their movements to be largely reactive, not predictive. Does this reflect the lack of capacity for predictive synchronization in monkeys, or lack of motivation to exhibit this behaviour? To discriminate these possibilities, we trained monkeys to make synchronized eye movements to a visual metronome. We found that monkeys could generate predictive saccades synchronized to periodic visual stimuli when an immediate reward was given for every predictive movement. This behaviour generalized to novel tempi, and the monkeys could maintain the tempo internally. Furthermore, monkeys could flexibly switch from predictive to reactive saccades when a reward was given for each reactive response. In contrast, when humans were asked to make a sequence of reactive saccades to a visual metronome, they often unintentionally generated predictive movements. These results suggest that even vocal non-learners may have the capacity for predictive and tempo-flexible synchronization to a beat, but that only certain vocal learning species are intrinsically motivated to do it.","[Takeya, Ryuji; Kameda, Masashi; Tanaka, Masaki] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan; [Patel, Aniruddh D.] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Patel, Aniruddh D.] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Azrieli Program Brain Mind & Consciousness, Toronto, ON, Canada","Hokkaido University; Tufts University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)","Takeya, R; Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.","takeryu@med.hokudai.ac.jp; masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp","Takeya, Ryuji/R-3090-2019; Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011","Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; Suhara Memorial Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25119005, 17H03539] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Suhara Memorial Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank T.

Cross-modal modulation can similarly enhance a neuronal representation, and this process can also operate at the primary cortical level. Phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity has been shown to be an important element of the underlying modulation of local cortical excitability in both cases. We investigated the influence of attention on oscillatory phase reset in primary auditory and visual cortices of macaques performing an intermodal selective attention task. In addition to responses driven by preferred modality stimuli, we noted that both preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli could modulate local cortical excitability by phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity, and that this effect was linked to their being attended. These findings outline a supramodal mechanism by which attention can control neurophysiological context, thus determining the representation of specific sensory content in primary sensory cortex.","[Lakatos, Peter; O'Connell, Monica N.; Barczak, Annamaria; Mills, Aimee; Javitt, Daniel C.; Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Barczak, Annamaria] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lakatos, Peter; Javitt, Daniel C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; New York University; Columbia University","Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.","plakatos@nki.rfmh.org","Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019","Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021","NIMH [MH061989, MH060358]","NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","We thank Dr. Ashesh D.

Objective: We report the effects of fluoro-cromolyn derivatives on microglial cell toxicity and microglial clearance of A beta(42). Methods: Microglial cell toxicity for cromolyn derivatives were determined in naive BV2 microglial cells. Microglial clearance assays were performed with A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cell line and single cell clone BV2 line expressing CD33WT. PET imaging was performed for three F-18 analogs in a rhesus macaque. Results: All compounds but derivative 8 exhibited lowmicroglial cell toxicity. Cromolyn 1 and derivatives 2, 4, and 7 displayed an increased uptake on A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cells. Derivative 4 increased A beta(42) uptake in a dose-dependent manner and at 75 mu M resulted in a one-fold increase in A beta(42) uptake in BV2-CD33(WT). PET imaging for three [F-18]cromolyn analogs revealed the order of brain tracer penetration to be 4a > 10 > 2a. Tracer 4a exhibited enhanced uptake in areas of high perfusion (putamen, grey matter, and cerebellum) and lower signal in areas of lower perfusion (caudate, thalamus, and white matter). Conclusion: Substantial uptake of A beta(42) in both naive BV2 and BV2-CD33WT cells observed with 4 indicate conversion of microglial cells from a pro-inflammatory to an activation state favoring A beta phagocytosis/clearance. These findings suggest that a fluoro-cromolyn analog could reduce fibril-prone A beta 42 in vivo and thereby serve as a therapeutic for the treatment and prevention of AD.","[Shoup, Timothy M.; Normandin, Marc D.; Dhaynaut, Maeva; Moon, Sung-Hyun; Guehl, Nicolas J.; Brugarolas, Pedro; Elmaleh, David R.; El Fakhri, Georges] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gordon Ctr Med Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Griciuc, Ana; Quinti, Luisa; Walsh, Lindsay, V; Tanzi, Rudolph E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, McCance Ctr Brain Hlth, Mass Gen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Dept Neurol,Genet & Aging Res Unit, Charlestown, MA USA; [Griciuc, Ana; Quinti, Luisa; Walsh, Lindsay, V; Tanzi, Rudolph E.] Harvard Med Sch, Charlestown, MA USA; [Elmaleh, David R.] AZTHERAPIES INC, Boston, MA USA","Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital","Elmaleh, DR (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St,Edwards Res 015, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;El Fakhri, G (corresponding author), 125 Nashua St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.","delmaleh@partners.org; elfakhri@pet.mgh.harvard.edu","Normandin, Marc D/C-6728-2015; Moon, Sung-Hyun/HPE-8086-2023","Normandin, Marc D/0000-0003-1645-523X; ","Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant [P41EB022544 TDR3]","Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant","This study was funded by the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant: P41EB022544 TDR3.

A few electrophysiological studies in simian primates have investigated the functional organization of pulvinar by examining visuotopic maps. Multiple visuotopic maps have been found for all studied simians, with differences in organization reported between New and Old World simians. Given that prosimians are considered closer to the common ancestors of New and Old World primates, we investigated the visuotopic organization of pulvinar in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnettii). Single-electrode extracellular recording was used to find the retinotopic maps in the lateral (PL) and inferior (PI) pulvinar. Based on recordings across cases, a 3D model of the map was constructed. From sections stained for Nissl bodies, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or cytochrome oxidase, we identified three PI chemoarchitectonic subdivisions, lateral central (PIcl), medial central (PIcm), and medial (PIm) inferior pulvinar. Two major retinotopic maps were identified that cover PL and PIcl, the dorsal one in dorsal PL and the ventral one in PIcl and ventral PL. Both maps represent central vision at the posterior end of the border between the maps, the upper visual field in the lateral half and the lower visual field in the medial half. They share many features with the maps reported for the pulvinar of simians, including the location in pulvinar and the representation of the upper-lower and central-peripheral visual field axes. The second-order representation in the lateral map and a laminar organization are likely features specific to Old World simians. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3432-3450, 2013.

The complex in vitro profile of buprenorphine, with affinity for mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors (OR), makes it difficult to predict its dose-related neuropharmacology in vivo. In rats, microPET imaging and pretreatment by OR antagonists were performed to assess the binding of radiolabeled buprenorphine (microdose C-11-buprenorphine) to OR subtypes in vivo (n = 4 per condition). The mu-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg) and the non-selective OR antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) blocked the binding of C-11-buprenorphine, while pretreatment by the delta-selective (naltrindole, 3 mg/kg) or the kappa-selective antagonist (norbinaltorphimine, 10 mg/kg) did not. In four macaques, PET imaging and kinetic modeling enabled description of the regional brain kinetics of C-11-buprenorphine, co-injected with increasing doses of unlabeled buprenorphine. No saturation of the brain penetration of buprenorphine was observed for doses up to 0.11 mg/kg. Regional differences in buprenorphine-associated receptor occupancy were observed. Analgesic doses of buprenorphine (0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg), respectively, occupied 20% and 49% of receptors in the thalamus while saturating the low but significant binding observed in cerebellum and occipital cortex.

PET data obtained after co-injection of an analgesic dose of buprenorphine (0.003 mg/kg) predicted the binding potential of microdose C-11-buprenorphine. This strategy could be further combined with pharmacodynamic exploration or pharmacological MRI to investigate the neuropharmacokinetics and neuroreceptor correlate, at least at mu-OR, of the acute effects of buprenorphine in humans.","[Auvity, Sylvain; Goutal, Sebastien; Caille, Fabien; Vodovar, Dominique; Wimberley, Catriona; Leroy, Claire; Tonietto, Matteo; Bottlaender, Michel; Tournier, Nicolas] Serv Hosp Frederic Joliot, JOLIOT, DRF, CEA, Orsay, France; [Auvity, Sylvain; Vodovar, Dominique] Univ Paris, UMR S 1144, Paris, France; [Goutal, Sebastien] Univ Paris Saclay, MIRCen, CEA, IBFJ,DRF JACOB,LMN,CNRS,UMR 9199, Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Caille, Fabien; Leroy, Claire; Tonietto, Matteo; Bottlaender, Michel; Tournier, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Imagerie Biomed Multimodale Paris Saclay, Inserm, CNRS,CEA,BioMaps, Orsay, France; [Pruvost, Alain] Univ Paris Saclay, Serv Pharmacol & Immunoanal SPI, Plateforme Smart MS, CEA,INRA, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Wimberley, Catriona] Univ Edinburgh, Queens Med Res Inst, Edinburgh Imaging, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Edinburgh","Tournier, N (corresponding author), Serv Hosp Frederic Joliot, JOLIOT, DRF, CEA, Orsay, France.;Tournier, N (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Imagerie Biomed Multimodale Paris Saclay, Inserm, CNRS,CEA,BioMaps, Orsay, France.","nicolas.tournier@universite-paris-saclay.fr","Auvity, Sylvain/GXF-8125-2022; Claire, LEROY/HZH-5593-2023; VODOVAR, Dominique/ABP-5785-2022; Vodovar, Dominique/AFR-7694-2022; Tonietto, Matteo/Q-4644-2018","VODOVAR, Dominique/0000-0002-8196-5511; Vodovar, Dominique/0000-0002-8196-5511; Tonietto, Matteo/0000-0001-9591-5710; Auvity, Sylvain/0000-0001-6208-6709","IDEX Paris-Saclay [ANR-11-INBS-0006];  [ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02]","IDEX Paris-Saclay; ","This work was performed on a platform member of France Life Imaging network (grant ANR-11-INBS-0006) and was funded by the Lidex-PIM project funded by the IDEX Paris-Saclay, ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02.

While their connectivity has been studied in primate and in rat, a complete mapping was still missing in the mouse. Here, we analyzed the afferents to the mouse ACC by injecting retrograde tracers in the ventral and dorsal areas of the ACC (areas 24a/b) and of the midcingulate cortex (MCC; areas 24a'/b'). Our results reveal inputs from five principal groups of structures: (1) cortical areas, mainly the orbital, medial prefrontal, retrosplenial, parietal associative, primary and secondary sensory areas and the hippocampus, (2) basal forebrain, mainly the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, the claustrum and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, (3) the thalamus, mainly the anteromedial, lateral mediodorsal, ventromedial, centrolateral, central medial and reuniens/rhomboid nuclei, (4) the hypothalamus, mainly the lateral and retromammillary areas, and (5) the brainstem, mainly the monoaminergic centers. The neurochemical nature of inputs from the diagonal band of Broca and brainstem centers was also investigated by double-labeling, showing that only a part of these afferents were cholinergic or monoaminergic. Comparisons between the areas indicate that areas 24a and 24b receive qualitatively similar inputs, but with different densities. These differences are more pronounced when comparing the inputs to ACC's areas 24a/24b to the inputs to MCC's areas 24a'/24b'. These results provide a complete analysis of the afferents to the mouse areas 24a/24b and 24a'/24b', which shows important similarity with the connectivity of homologous areas in rats, and brings the anatomical basis necessary to address the roles of cingulate areas in mice.","[Fillinger, Clementine; Yalcin, Ipek; Barrot, Michel; Veinante, Pierre] CNRS, Inst Neurosci Cellulaires & Integrat, 5 Rue Blaise Pascal, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Fillinger, Clementine; Veinante, Pierre] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg","Veinante, P (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Neurosci Cellulaires & Integrat, 5 Rue Blaise Pascal, F-67084 Strasbourg, France.;Veinante, P (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.","veinantep@inci-cnrs.unistra.fr",,"Veinante, Pierre/0000-0002-6608-8960; Fillinger, Clementine/0000-0003-3410-533X; Yalcin, Ipek/0000-0003-2596-8598","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique [UPR3212]; University of Strasbourg; NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from Brain & Behavior Research Foundation","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); University of Strasbourg; NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from Brain & Behavior Research Foundation(NARSAD)","This work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (contract UPR3212), the University of Strasbourg, and by a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation.

Visual responses were probed with spatially uniform flickering stimuli, so that retinal processing was uninfluenced by eye movements. Nonetheless, saccades had diverse effects, altering not only response strength but also the temporal and chromatic properties of the receptive field. Of these changes, the most prominent was a biphasic modulation of response strength, weak suppression followed by strong enhancement. Saccadic modulation was widespread, and affected both of the major processing streams in the LGN.

The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using O-15-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These treatments are considered to work by changing something fundamental in the brain (physical) or through psychological changes. Since the physical substrate of the psychosocial factors is accepted as the brain, the notion that all these treatments work through the brain is widely accepted among biologically oriented mental health professionals. However, knowledge regarding the specific parts of the brain involved in depression is limited. In this article, a model that provides a preliminary basis for understanding the neuroanatomical substrates of depression is presented. The model discusses and integrates the neuroanatomical basis of each of the different facets of depression including the cognitive, behavioral, and vegetative symptoms.

The control of voluntary saccades to visual and remembered targets is modeled in terms of interactions between posterior parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, the basal ganglia (caudate and substantia nigra), superior colliculus, mediodorsal thalamus, and the saccade generator of the brainstem. Interactions include the modulation of eye movement motor error maps by topographic inhibitory projections, dynamic remapping of spatial target representations in saccade motor error maps, and sustained neural activity that embodies spatial memory.

As for background MEG activity, the power of alpha frequency bands peaking at around 10 Hz was much increased during meditation over occipital, parietal and temporal regions, when compared with the non-meditative state, which might mean the subject was very relaxed, though he did not fall asleep, during meditation. Primary pain-related cortical activities recorded from primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) by MEG were very weak or absent during meditation. As for fMRI recording, there were remarkable changes in levels of activity in the thalamus, SII-insula (mainly the insula) and cingulate cortex between meditation and non-meditation. Activities in all three regions were increased during non-meditation, similar to results in normal subjects. In contrast, activities in all three regions were weaker during meditation, and the level was lower than the baseline in the thalamus. Recent neuroirnaging and electrophysiological studies have clarified that the emotional aspect of pain perception mainly involves the insula and cingulate cortex. Though we cannot clearly explain this unusual condition in the Yoga Master, a change of multiple regions relating to pain perception could be responsible, since pain is a complex sensory and emotional experience.

Methods: We performed intra-cerebral electrical stimulations in seven patients investigated by depth electrodes for refractory epilepsy and analyzed the presence of evoked potentials (EPs) in all brain regions explored. Bipolar electrical stimulations, consisting of two series of 25 pulses of 1 ms duration, 0.2 Hz frequency, and 3 mA intensity, were delivered in a total of 36 hippocampal stimulations sites. Results: Reproducible EPs were recorded in several brain regions with variable latencies, amplitudes and morphologies. Within the temporal lobe, EPs were present in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, temporal pole and temporal neocortex. EPs were also observed in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex, midcingulate and posterior cingulate gyrus, insula and thalamic pulvinar nucleus. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a large distribution of direct or indirect hippocampal projections. Significance: This widespread connectivity supports the previous definition of different networks involved mainly in memory and behavioral processes, implicating the temporal lobe, the cingulate gyrus or the prefrontal region. Our data provide some clues to further evaluate potential pathways of propagation of mesial temporal lobe seizure, via the insula or the pulvinar nucleus.

The likelihood that glutamate-immunoreactive (GLU-IR) terminals directly innervate STT neurons was investigated. For these studies three lamina IV or V STT cells in the lumbar spinal cords of three monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were identified electrophysiologically and characterized. Two were identified as high threshold neurons and one as a wide dynamic range neuron. Following intracellular injection of the cells with HRP and reaction to give the cells a Golgi-like appearance, the tissues were processed for electron microscopy. Postembedding immunogold methods with antibodies specific for glutamate were used to identify GLU-IR terminals apposing the somata and dendrites of the STT neurons, including dendrites that extended into laminae IV and III. The GLU-IR terminals were numerous and constituted a mean of 46% of the population counted that appose the STT soma and 50% of the profiles apposing the dendrites. Fifty-four percent of the somatic and 50% of the dendritic surface length was contacted by GLU-IR terminals. Most terminals contained round clear vesicles and some contained a variable number of large dense core vesicles. For one of the three cells examined it was determined that 45% of the terminals apposing the soma were GLU-IR and 30% of the terminals were gamma aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive (GABA-IR). In an additional monkey, a lamina I cell retrogradely labeled from the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus was found to be ensheathed in glial processes. Of the 9 terminals observed apposing the retrogradely filled STT neuron in one plane of section, 2 were GLU-IR and 3 were GABA-IR. The data suggest that a large percentage of the profiles adjacent to STT neurons in intermediate laminae of the spinal cord contain glutamate and many synapse directly with STT neurons.",,,"WESTLUND, KN (corresponding author), UNIV TEXAS,INST MARINE BIOMED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROSCI,MED BRANCH,GALVESTON,TX 77555, USA.",,"Westlund, Karin/R-6960-2019","Westlund High, Karin/0000-0002-7388-4834","NINDS NIH HHS [NS29910, NS28064, NS11255, P01 NS011255] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,52,30,30,0,0,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

Despite the voluminous available literature on this subject, the role of basal ganglia in health and disease remains controversial. Experimental data on the effects of stimulation and ablation of the basal ganglia are summarized. The roles of the basal ganglia in the preparation for and execution of cortically initiated movement are described. Newer roles ascribed to the basal ganglia in sensory-motor gating, cognition, emotion, and motivation are discussed. The old and current concepts of information flow between the cerebral cortex, striatum, pallidum, thalamus, and back to the cerebral cortex are reviewed. The ''funnel'' system of information flow has been discarded in favor of several parallel and largely segregated loops pertaining to motor, oculomotor, cognitive, and limbic functions. The anatomic substrate of each of these loops is described. The specific roles of the striatum, pallidum, substantia nigra, and thalamus in information flow as related to movement are described. The roles of the basal ganglia in reinforcing wanted behavior and suppressing unwanted behavior via direct and indirect striatal loops are discussed. The implications of these loops in the genesis of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea are described. Alteration in basal ganglia neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, and Parkinson's disease are described.","UNIV IOWA,COLL MED,DEPT PEDIAT,IOWA CITY,IA; UNIV IOWA,COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,IOWA CITY,IA; UNIV IOWA,COLL MED,DEPT ANAT,IOWA CITY,IA","University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Iowa",,,,,,,,,111,42,42,0,8,"DECKER PERIODICALS INC","HAMILTON","4 HUGHSON STREET SOUTH PO BOX 620, LCD 1, HAMILTON ON L8N 3K7, CANADA","0883-0738",,,"J CHILD NEUROL","J.

Methods: Spatially normalized images of FDOPA influx rate constant (Ki) values and relative regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rrCMRglc) were created. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) scores and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were used to determine the patients' cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Multiple correlation analyses between the FDOPA and FDG images and the cognitive and motor scores were performed for each voxel. Results: RCPM score was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the left hippocampus and with the rrCMRglc in the left middle frontal gyrus and right retrosplenial cortex. Motor function was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the bilateral striatum and with the rrCMRglc in association areas and primary visual cortex. The level of motor function was significantly inversely correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the anterior cingulate gyrus and with the rrCMRgle in bilateral primary motor cortex and right putamen. Conclusions: Changes of striatal FDOPA uptake and rrCMRglc in the primary motor cortex likely represent dysfunction in the motor system involving the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Change of FDOPA uptake in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be related to up-regulation of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopamine neurons. The regions where correlation with cognitive function was observed belong to a cognitive frontoparietal-hippocampal network.

MMN is elicited most commonly in an auditory oddball paradigm in which a sequence of repetitive standard stimuli is interrupted infrequently and unexpectedly by a physically deviant 'oddball' stimulus. Electro- and magnetoencephalographic dipole mapping studies have localized the generators of MMN to supratemporal auditory cortex in the vicinity of Heschl's gyrus, but have not determined the degree to which MMN reflects activation within primary auditory cortex (AI) itself. The present study, using moveable multichannel electrodes inserted acutely into superior temporal plane, demonstrates a significant contribution of AI to scalp-recorded MMN in the monkey, as reflected by greater response of AI to loud or soft clicks presented as deviants than to the same stimuli presented as repetitive standards. The MMN-like activity was localized primarily to supragranular laminae within AI. Thus, standard and deviant stimuli elicited similar degrees of initial, thalamocortical excitation. In contrast, responses within supragranular cortex were significantly larger to deviant stimuli than to standards. No MMN-like activity was detected in a limited number to passes that penetrated anterior and medial to AI. AI plays a well established role in the decoding of the acoustic properties of individual stimuli. The present study demonstrates that primary auditory cortex also plays an important role in processing the relationships between stimuli, and thus participates in cognitive, as well as purely sensory, processing of auditory information.","YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROSCI,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT PEDIAT,BRONX,NY 10461; BRONX PSYCHIAT CTR,DEPT PSYCHIAT,BRONX,NY 10461","Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine","JAVITT, DC (corresponding author), YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT PSYCHIAT,ROOM K322,1300 MORRIS PK AVE,BRONX,NY 10461, USA.",,"Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019","Steinschneider, Mitchell/0000-0002-8932-3943","NIDCD NIH HHS [R29 DC00657] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [R03 MH46962, R01 MH06723] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,29,182,185,0,14,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0006-8993",,,"BRAIN RES","Brain Res.","DEC 26",1994,667,2,,,,,192,200,,"10.1016/0006-8993(94)91496-6","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91496-6"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91496-6"")",,,9,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Neurosciences & Neurology","QA727",7697356,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1994QA72700004","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1994QA72700004"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

With the increased use of multielectrode recording techniques, synchronous firing of ensembles of neurons has been found at all levels in the mammalian visual pathway, from the retina to the extrastriate cortex. Here we distinguish three categories of synchrony in the visual system, (a) synchrony from anatomical divergence, (b) stimulus-dependent synchrony, and (c) emergent synchrony (oscillations). Although all three categories have been well documented, their functional significance remains uncertain. We discuss several lines of evidence both for and against a role for synchrony in visual processing: the perceptual consequences of synchronous activity, its ability to carry information, and the transmission of synchronous neural events to subsequent stages of processing.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Usrey, WM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","Clay_Reid@hms.harvard.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [F32 EY06604, R01 EY10115] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,139,248,252,0,17,"ANNUAL REVIEWS","PALO ALTO","4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA","0066-4278","1545-1585",,"ANNU REV PHYSIOL","Annu.

When MD is combined with a pharmacological inhibition of the visual cortex, the cortical neurons weaken their response to an open eye and the input axons serving the open eye retract. To determine whether the 2 types of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity reflect an experience-driven modification of neural circuits sharing the same developmental time course, we analyzed the OD plasticity in an inhibited visual cortex using cats at different ages. MD did not affect the OD distribution in the inhibited cortex of adults, confirming that the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex represents a developmental plasticity. In developing animals, the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex was observed at the late phase of the critical period (P40-46) but not at the early phase (P22-26). We found a retraction of input axons serving an open eye at the late phase, whereas those at the early phase were comparable to the axons of normal animals.

For the quantitative analysis of SEPT binding in vivo, two serial PET scans with [C-11](+)McN5652 and [C-11](-)McN5652 were performed in the same animals in a day and the differences in radioactivities of [C-11](+)McN5652 vs. [C-11](-)McN5652 measured from 41-91 min postinjection were calculated as an estimate of specific ligand binding. Higher specific binding of SEPT was observed in the thalamus and striatum, regions known to contain high densities of SERT by in vitro assay, with intermediate levels in the pens, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and cortical regions and lower levels in the cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. Almost all regions assayed except the cerebellum showed significant age-related decreases in the specific binding of SERT, which showed reverse correlation with cortisol level in plasma. When the SEPT blocker fluvoxamine (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 min after tracer injection, specific binding of SEPT was displaced in both age groups. However, the degree of displacement was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. Cortisol level in plasma was significantly higher in aged than in young animals. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of the combined use of [C-11](+)McN5652 and [C-11](-)McN5652 as an indicator for the age-related changes in cortical SEPT measured noninvasively by PET. In addition, these observations suggest that the age-related impairment of SERT sensitivity for fluvoxamine might be related to the reduced efficacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly patients with depression.

We aimed to determine whether or not the pulvinar signal intensity (SI) on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences at 3.0T MRI differs between AD patients and normal subjects, and also whether the pulvinar SI is correlated with the T2(star) map, an imaging marker for tissue iron, and a cognitive scale. Materials and Methods: Twenty one consecutive patients with AD and 21 age-matched control subjects were prospectively included in this study. The pulvinar SI was assessed on the FLAIR image. We measured the relative SI ratio of the pulvinar to the corpus callosum. The T2(star) values were calculated from the T2(star) relaxometry map. The differences between the two groups were analyzed, by using a Student t test. The correlation between the measurements was assessed by the Pearson's correlation test. Results: As compared to the normal white matter, the FLAIR signal intensity of the pulvinar nucleus was significantly more hypointense in the AD patients than in the control subjects (p < 0.01). The pulvinar T2(star) was shorter in the AD patients than in the control subjects (51.5 +/- 4.95 ms vs. 56.5 +/- 5.49 ms, respectively, p = 0.003). The pulvinar SI ratio was strongly correlated with the pulvinar T2(star) (r = 0.745, p < 0.001). When controlling for age, only the pulvinar-to-CC SI ratio was positively correlated with that of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.303, p < 0.050). Conversely, the pulvinar T2(star) was not correlated with the MMSE score (r = 0.277, p = 0.080). Conclusion: The FLAIR hypointensity of the pulvinar nucleus represents an abnormal iron accumulation in AD and may be used as an adjunctive finding for evaluating AD.","[Han, Seol-Heui] Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Geriatr Neurosci Res, Seoul 143792, South Korea; [Kim, Hee-Jin] Hanyang Univ, Sch Med, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Kim, Hee-Jin; Han, Seol-Heui] Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Seoul 143792, South Korea; [Moon, Won-Jin; Roh, Hong Gee; Choi, Jin Woo] Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Seoul 143792, South Korea","Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Hanyang University; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center; Konkuk University; Konkuk University Medical Center","Han, SH (corresponding author), Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Geriatr Neurosci Res, 120-1 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 143792, South Korea.","alzdoc@kuh.ac.kr",,"Moon, Won-Jin/0000-0002-8925-7376","BK 21 (Brain Korea 21) Project; Konkuk University","BK 21 (Brain Korea 21) Project(Ministry of Education & Human Resources Development (MOEHRD), Republic of Korea); Konkuk University","This research was supported by the second stage of BK 21 (Brain Korea 21) Project in 2008.; This research was also supported by Konkuk University in 2012.",,60,15,16,0,14,"KOREAN RADIOLOGICAL SOC","SEOUL","121-8 YANGJAE-DONG, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL 137-130, SOUTH KOREA","1229-6929","2005-8330",,"KOREAN J RADIOL","Korean J.

A classic example is perception of a stable visual world in spite of the saccadic eye movements that shift the images on the retina. A long-standing hypothesis is that the brain compensates for the disruption of visual input by using advance knowledge of the impending saccade, an internally generated corollary discharge. One possible neuronal mechanism for this compensation has been previously identified in parietal and frontal cortex of monkeys, but the origin of the necessary corollary discharge remained unknown. Here, we consider recent experiments that identified a pathway for a corollary discharge for saccades that extends from the superior colliculus in the midbrain to the frontal eye fields in the cerebral cortex with a relay in the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. We first review the nature of the evidence used to identify a corollary discharge signal in the complexity of the primate brain and show its use for guiding a rapid sequence of eye movements. We then consider two experiments that show this same corollary signal may provide the input to the frontal cortex neurons that alters their activity with saccades in ways that could compensate for the displacements in the visual input produced by saccadic eye movements. The first experiment shows that the corollary discharge signal is spatially and temporally appropriate to produce the alterations in the frontal-cortex neurons. The second shows that this signal is necessary for this alteration because inactivation of the corollary reduces the compensation by frontal-cortex neurons. The identification of this relatively simple circuit specifies the organization of a corollary discharge in the primate brain for the first time and provides a specific example upon which consideration of the roles of corollary activity in other systems and for other functions can be evaluated.","[Sommer, Marc A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Sommer, Marc A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Sommer, Marc A.; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)","Sommer, MA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, A210 Langley Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","masommer@pitt.edu",,"Sommer, Marc/0000-0001-5061-763X","Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 EY000109-27] Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY017592] Funding Source: Medline","Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,20,54,54,0,9,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0301-0066","1468-4233",,"PERCEPTION","Perception",,2008,37,3,,,,,408,418,,"10.1068/p5873","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5873"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5873"")",,,11,"Ophthalmology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Ophthalmology; Psychology","300TF",18491718,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000255847400009","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000255847400009"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Two of the novel isoforms displayed a deletion in the third intracellular loop (H-3(413) and H-3(410)), the third isoform H-3(335) displayed a deletion in the i3 intracellular loop and a complete deletion of the putative fifth transmembrane domain TM5. We have confirmed by RT-PCR the expression of full-length H-3(445) mRNA as well as H-3(413), H-3(410), and H-3(335) splice isoform mRNA in multiple monkey brain regions including the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. The full-length isoform H-3(445) was predominant in all of the regions tested, followed by H-3(335), with the H-3(413) and H-3(410) being of low abundance. When expressed in C6 cells, H-3(445), H-3(413), and H-3(410) exhibit high affinity binding to the agonist ligand [H-3]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine with respective pK(D) values of 9.7, 9.7, and 9.6. As expected, the H-3(335) isoform did not display any saturable binding with [H-3]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine. The histamine H-3 receptor agonists histamine, (R)-alpha-methylhistamine, imetit and proxyfan were able to activate calcium mobilization responses through H-3(445), H-3(413) and H-3(410) receptors when they were co-expressed with the chimeric G alpha(qi5)-protein in HEK293 cells, while no response was elicited in cells expressing the H-3(335) isoform. The existence of multiple H-3 receptor splice isoforms across species raises the possibility that isoform specific properties including ligand affinity, signal transduction coupling, and brain localization may differentially contribute to observed in vivo effects of histamine H-3 receptor antagonists.

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 40-Hz-selective responses in the cerebellar Crus II auditory region could be explained by frequency-specific enabling of interactions in the auditory cortico-cerebellar-thalamic loop.

Multiple injections of small amounts of ibotenic acid were used to produce fiber-sparing lesions of either the anterior (ACC) or the posterior (PCC) cingulate area. Mice with ACC lesions, though learning the initial acquisition and first reversal of the discrimination at about the normal rate, were impaired during the subsequent four reversal sessions. In contrast to control mice, they failed to improve their performance from the first to the last session. Nevertheless, when later required to repeatedly learn the same discrimination over several days (repetitive testing), animals with ACC lesions no longer exhibited any learning deficit. The converse pattern of results was found in mice with PCC lesions. These animals performed much more poorly than control animals during the acquisition and first reversal of the discrimination, but displayed remarkable improvement over the subsequent four reversal sessions, gradually overcoming their initial impairment. However, when later submitted to repetitive testing, these animals again showed a substantial learning deficit. Neither ACC nor PCC cingulate lesions significantly affected the animals' retention capacities as measured by single test-trials over a 24-h interval. Yet, mice with PCC lesions were retarded in reversal learning after a long intersession interval (10 days), indicating that PCC, but not ACC, lesions did interfere with some long-term retention processes. These results imply that the ACC, as a part of the medial frontal cortex, may play a crucial role in temporally ordering a series of spatial responses, whereas the PCC seems to contribute to the formation and retention of each individual spatial response, probably by transmitting information from limbic structures such as the anterior thalamus and hippocampal formation to posterior neocortical association areas.","UNIV BORDEAUX 1,PSYCHOPHYSIOL LAB,CNRS,URA 339,AVE FAC,F-33405 TALENCE,FRANCE","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux",,,"MEUNIER, Martine/C-2611-2015","MEUNIER, Martine/0000-0002-9380-9372",,,,,60,56,56,0,3,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0166-4328",,,"BEHAV BRAIN RES","Behav.

Thus, interictal metabolic dysfunction is variable and usually extensive in TLE, whereas decreased central benzodiazepine-receptor density is more restricted to mesial temporal areas. Metabolic patterns in TLE may reflect diaschisis, while benzodiazepine-receptor changes may reflect localized neuronal and synaptic loss that is specific to the epileptogenic zone.

In some systems, guiding cues for axonal pathfinding and target selection are provided by specific cells that are present only at critical times. For instance, the floor plate guides commissural axons in the spinal cord, and the subplate is involved in the formation of thalamocortical connections. Here we study the development of entorhinal and commissural connections to the murine hippocampus, which in the adult terminate in nonoverlapping layers. We show that two groups of pioneer neurons, Cajal-Retzius cells and GABAergic neurons, form layer-specific scaffolds that overlap with distinct hippocampal afferents at embryonic and early postnatal stages. Furthermore, at postnatal day 0 (P0)-P5, before the dendrites of pyramidal neurons develop, these pioneer neurons are preferential synaptic targets for hippocampal afferents. Birthdating analysis using 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulses showed that most such early-generated neurons disappear at late postnatal stages, most likely by cell death. Together with previous studies, these findings indicate that distinct pioneer neurons are involved in the guidance and targeting of different hippocampal afferents.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim & Plant Cell Biol, Barcelona 08028, Spain","CHARMEU; University of Barcelona","Soriano, E (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Anim & Plant Cell Biol, Diagonal 645, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",,"Del Rio Fernandez, Jose A/AAD-1121-2020; del rio, jose antonio/L-9232-2014","del rio, jose antonio/0000-0002-5214-4909; Martinez, Albert/0000-0003-0831-9916; Super, Hans/0000-0001-9328-0096",,,,,72,132,134,0,2,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

As in the human, three subtypes of GnRH neurons were identified. Type I GnRH neurons were small, oval cells with high levels of gene expression and were located within the basal hypothalamus. Type II GnRH neurons were small and sparsely labeled and were widely scattered in the hypothalamus, midline nuclei of the thalamus, and extended amygdala. Type III neurons displayed magnocellular morphology and intermediate labeling intensity and were located in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, caudate, and amygdala. In a second experiment, we determined the effect of estrogen or estrogn plus progesterone on the gene expression of GnRH neurons in the brains of young, ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys. We report that hormone treatment resulted in a significant decrease in GnRH mRNA in type I neurons within the basal hypothalamus of ovariectomized monkeys. In contrast, there was no effect of hormone treatment on the gene expression of type III GnRH neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The present findings provide evidence that the increase in gene expression of type I GnRH neurons in postmenopausal women is secondary to the ovarian failure of menopause. The differential responses of type I and III GnRH neurons to hormone treatment provide additional evidence that distinct subpopulations of neurons expressing GnRH mRNA exist in the primate hypothalamus.","Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Comparat Med Sect, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center","Rance, NE (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Pathol, 1501N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.","nrance@u.arizona.edu",,,"NIA NIH HHS [AG-09214] Funding Source: Medline","NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))",,,42,23,24,0,1,"ENDOCRINE SOC","CHEVY CHASE","8401 CONNECTICUT AVE, SUITE 900, CHEVY CHASE, MD 20815-5817 USA","0021-972X",,,"J CLIN ENDOCR METAB","J.

We evaluated real-time acoustic feedback and aimed to understand whether cavitation contributed to the heating and the lesion formation. In four macaques, we sonicated thalamic targets at acoustic powers of 34-560 W (896-7590 J). Tissue effects evaluated with MRI and histology were compared to MRI-based temperature and thermal dose measurements, acoustic emissions recorded during the experiments, and acoustic and thermal simulations. Peak temperatures ranged from 46 to 57 degrees C, and lesions were produced in 5/8 sonicated targets. A linear relationship was observed between the applied acoustic energy and both the focal and brain surface heating. Thermal dose thresholds were 15-50 cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C, similar to prior studies at higher frequencies. Histology was also consistent with earlier studies of thermal effects in the brain. The system successfully controlled the power level and maintained a low level of cavitation activity. Increased acoustic emissions observed in 3/4 animals occurred when the focal temperature rise exceeded approximately 16 degrees C. Thresholds for thermally-significant subharmonic and wideband emissions were 129 and 140 W, respectively, corresponding to estimated pressure amplitudes of 2.1 and 2.2 MPa. Simulated focal heating was consistent with the measurements for sonications without thermally-significant acoustic emissions; otherwise it was consistently lower than the measurements. Overall, these results suggest that the lesions were produced by thermal mechanisms. The detected acoustic emissions, however, and their association with heating suggest that cavitation might have contributed to the focal heating. Compared to earlier work with a 670 kHz TcMRgFUS system, the brain surface heating was substantially reduced and the focal heating was higher with this 230 kHz system, suggesting that a reduced frequency can increase the treatment envelope for TcMRgFUS and potentially reduce the risk of skull heating.","[McDannold, Nathan; Top, Can Baris; Sutton, Jonathan; Todd, Nick; Vykhodtseva, Natalia] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Livingstone, Margaret; Top, Can Baris] Aselsan AS, Adv Sensing Res Program Dept, Ankara, Turkey","Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Aselsan","McDannold, N (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","njm@bwh.harvard.edu","Top, Can Baris/AAJ-6092-2021; Top, Can Barış/Y-3542-2019","Top, Can Baris/0000-0003-2746-2371; Sutton, Jonathan/0000-0002-2972-0592; Livingstone, Margaret/0000-0002-1950-0123","NIH [R01EB003268, P01CA174645, R25CA089017]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [2219]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This work was supported by NIH grants R01EB003268, P01CA174645, and R25CA089017.

Enhanced haemodynamic responses during attentive conditions defined an occipitoparietofrontal system, including sensory and association areas, as well as the medial thalamus and superior colliculus. Attentional modulation was not restricted to extrastriate areas (including V3a and the V5 complex) but was also evident, to a lesser degree, in early visual areas close to the calcarine fissure (V1/V2 border), Attention-related enhancement of cortical responsiveness is discussed in terms of data that implicate modulatory short-term changes in synaptic efficacy and reciprocal connections between striate, extrastriate, parietal and frontal areas.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 tesla (T), collective responses of neural populations in the LGN were measured as a function of stimulus contrast and flicker reversal rate and compared with those obtained in visual cortex. Flickering checkerboard stimuli presented in alternation to the right and left hemifields reliably activated the LGN. The peak of the LGN activation was found to be on average within +/-2 mm of the anatomical location of the LGN, as identified on high-resolution structural images. In all visual areas except the middle temporal (MT), fMRI responses increased monotonically with stimulus contrast. In the LGN, the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the cortex. Contrast sensitivity was lowest in the LGN and V1 and increased gradually in extrastriate cortex. In area MT, responses were saturated at 4% contrast. Response modulation by changes in flicker rate was similar in the LGN and V1 and occurred mainly in the frequency range between 0.5 and 7.5 Hz; in contrast, in extrastriate areas V4, V3A, and MT, responses were modulated mainly in the frequency range between 7.5 and 20 Hz. In the human pulvinar, no activations were obtained with the experimental designs used to probe response properties of the LGN. However, regions in the mediodorsal right and left pulvinar were found to be consistently activated by bilaterally presented flickering checkerboard stimuli, when subjects attended to the stimuli. Taken together, our results demonstrate that fMRI at 3 T can be used effectively to study thalamocortical circuits in the human brain.","Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Princeton University","Kastner, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","skastner@princeton.edu",,"Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X","NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH-64043, P50 MH-62196] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,77,166,167,0,14,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

The fiber connectivity of RSC had been reported in rodent and primate studies by tracer injection methods To explore structural and functional connectivity of two sub-regions of RSC, Brodmann area (BA)29 and BA30, we constructed fiber connectivity networks of two sub-regions by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional connectivity networks by resting-state functional MRI. The BA29 network showed fiber connections with auditory cortex and functional connections with BA21. Both fiber and functional connections show that BA30 network includes visual cortex. Furthermore, BA30 had fiber connections with hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. We suggest that (1) structural connectivity reflects functional connectivity in some degree. (2) BA29 mainly received and processed sound information from auditory cortex, while BA30 mainly received and processed scene information from visual cortex.","[Li, Panlong; Liang, Shengxiang; Sun, Xi; Feng, Ting; Li, Demin] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Phys, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Li, Panlong; Liang, Shengxiang; Nie, Binbin; Duan, Shaofeng; Huang, Qi; Zhang, Tianhao; Sun, Xi; Feng, Ting; Shan, Baoci; Liu, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Radiog Tech & Equipment, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Nie, Binbin; Duan, Shaofeng; Huang, Qi; Zhang, Tianhao; Shan, Baoci; Liu, Hua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Nucl Sci & Technol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shan, Han; Ma, Lin] Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China; [Shan, Baoci] CAS Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Techn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhengzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of High Energy Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital","Li, DM (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Phys, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.;Shan, BC; Liu, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Radiog Tech & Equipment, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","shanbc@ihep.ac.cn; lidm@zzu.edu.cn; liuhua@ihep.ac.cn","Zhang, Tianhao/IAQ-9078-2023; Huang, Qi/ISS-1275-2023","Zhang, Tianhao/0000-0002-8765-0799; Huang, Qi/0000-0002-9425-6618; Duan, Shaofeng/0000-0002-2695-5898; Nie, Binbin/0000-0002-8038-7772; Liu, Hua/0000-0002-0301-3144; Shan, Baoci/0000-0001-7417-5063","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81471741, 81471728, 81671770]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 81471741, 81471728, 81671770].",,47,15,15,2,34,"ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD","CLARE","ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","0304-3940","1872-7972",,"NEUROSCI LETT","Neurosci.

To study optic radiations connectivity by means of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches, noninvasively, in vivo, in healthy human brains. METHODS. Sixteen healthy subjects (nine males, age range, 25-40 years) were included in this study. Morphologic and diffusion data were acquired by means of a 3T MRI scanner. Using an advanced tractographic technique, based on probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm, postprocessing analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Outcome measure was the percentage distribution of optic radiations streamlines in different cortical visual areas (V1-V5). The latter were detected by means of Juelich probabilistic histologic atlas. RESULTS. Average connectivity analyses revealed that the optic radiations are mainly distributed in V1 (47.46% +/- 5.5) and V2 (32.45% +/- 3.98); furthermore, direct connections with V3 (7.81 +/- 3.06), V4 (4.22% +/- 1.82), and V5 (8.06% +/- 2.65) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS. In the present study, the connectivity profile of optic radiations, obtained by means of algorithms not affected by the limitations of other tractographic techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, was shown in healthy human brains. Interestingly, direct connections with V4 were detected for the first time in humans; moreover, further support on the possible existence of V5 connections was provided. Our findings showed new connections between lateral geniculate nuclei and cortical visual areas, giving a further possible comprehension of the phenomena leading to the visual signals elaboration.","[Arrigo, Alessandro; Mormina, Enricomaria; Gaeta, Michele; Anastasi, Giuseppe Pio; Aragona, Pasquale] Univ Messina, Dept Biomed Sci & Morphol & Funct Images, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy; [Calamuneri, Alessandro] Univ Messina, Dept Neurosci, Messina, Italy; [Quartarone, Angelo; Marino, Silvia] IRCCS Ctr Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo, Messina, Italy","University of Messina; University of Messina; IRCCS Bonino Pulejo","Arrigo, A (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dept Biomed Sci & Morphol & Funct Images, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy.","alessandro.arrigo@hotmail.com","Aragona, Pasquale/I-5286-2012; Mormina, Enricomaria/K-4664-2016; Marino, Silvia/T-5118-2019; Anastasi, Giuseppe/ABI-5282-2020; Calamuneri, Alessandro/K-8065-2016; QUARTARONE, Angelo/G-3264-2017","Aragona, Pasquale/0000-0002-9582-9799; Mormina, Enricomaria/0000-0003-2716-5772; Marino, Silvia/0000-0002-1088-6808; Calamuneri, Alessandro/0000-0003-3164-6464; Arrigo, Alessandro/0000-0003-4715-8414; QUARTARONE, Angelo/0000-0003-1485-6590",,,,,48,15,15,0,2,"ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC","ROCKVILLE","12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA","0146-0404","1552-5783",,"INVEST OPHTH VIS SCI","Invest.

One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our in silico model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.","[Beul, Sarah F.; Goulas, Alexandros; Hilgetag, Claus C.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Computat Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany; [Hilgetag, Claus C.] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA","University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Boston University","Beul, SF (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Computat Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany.","s.beul@uke.de",,"Goulas, Alexandros/0000-0002-5381-0096","German Research Council DFG [SFB 936, TRR169, SPP2041/HI1286/7-1]; Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation","German Research Council DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","This work was supported by the German Research Council DFG (SFB 936/A1, Z3 (CCH); TRR169/A2 (CCH); SPP2041/HI1286/7-1 (CCH); http://www.dfg.de/), the Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2 (CCH); https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/) as well as the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AG; https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,135,17,17,0,0,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1553-734X","1553-7358",,"PLOS COMPUT BIOL","PLoS Comput.

This antibody preferentially stains LGN cells that display the morphological characteristics of Y-cells. The soma sizes of SMI-32-stained cells were consistent with those of the overall population of Y-cells, and the Golgi-like staining of their dendrites revealed a radial distribution that often crossed laminar boundaries. Labeled cells were distributed within the A laminae (primarily near laminar borders), the magnocellular portion of the C laminae, and the medial intralaminar nucleus, but they were absent in the parvocellular C laminae. Electron microscopic examination of SMl-32-stained tissue revealed that staining was confined to somata, dendrites, and large myelinated axons. Retinal synapses on SMI-32-labeled dendrites were primarily simple axodendritic contacts; few triadic arrangements were observed. In the LGN of cats reared with monocular lid suture, SMI-32, staining was decreased significantly in the A laminae that received input from the deprived eye. Dephosphorylation of the tissue did not alter the cellular SMI-32 staining patterns. Analysis of staining patterns in the G laminae and monocular zone of the A laminae suggests that changes in the cytoskeleton after lid suture reflect cell class and not binocular competition. Taken together, the results from normal and lid-sutured animals suggest that the cat LGN offers a unique model system in which the cytoskeleton of one class of cells can be manipulated by altering neuronal activity.","Univ Louisville, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","University of Louisville; Louisiana State University System; Wake Forest University","Bickford, ME (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, 500 S Preston St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",,,"Godwin, Dwayne/0000-0002-0376-4968","NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY011695, EY11695] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R29 NS035377-05, R29NS35377, R29 NS035377] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,52,58,60,0,1,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate brain-activity patterns related to a word-pair association task employing a whole-brain EPI sequence. Six right-handed, healthy male volunteers (mean age: 27.5 years) took part in the study. fMRI was performed at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla with 26-32 slices parallel to the AC-PC line, depending on individual brain size. Distributed brain regions were activated in episodic encoding and retrieval with similarities, but also (distinct) differences in activation patterns. Bilateral prefrontal cortical areas were involved when comparing encoding as well as retrieval to the reference condition (nonsense words). Furthermore, activation was observed in cerebellar areas during encoding, and activation in bilateral parietal areas (precuneus and inferior parietal cortex) was differentially more pronounced during retrieval. The activation of left dorsomedial thalamus during retrieval of high imagery-content word-pair associates may point to the role of this structure in episodic retrieval. The direct cognitive subtraction of encoding minus retrieval yielded a differentially larger left prefrontal activation. There was a differentially higher right prefrontal activation during retrieval than during encoding, underlining the proposed right/left asymmetry for episodic memory processes.","Univ Dusseldorf Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; Res Ctr Julich, Dept Nucl Med KME, Julich, Germany; Res Ctr Julich, Inst Med IME, Julich, Germany; Univ Tubingen, Inst Med Psychol & Behav Neurobiol, Tubingen, Germany; Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Gen Psychol, Magdeburg, Germany","Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; CIVIS; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital; Otto von Guericke University","Mottaghy, FM (corresponding author), Univ Dusseldorf Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Moorenstr 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",,"Mottaghy, Felix/AAU-2673-2020; Shah, N.

Understanding how these brain networks work together is fundamental for appreciating network-wise changes reported in patients with chronic pain disorders. Parcellating pain related networks and understanding their causal relationships is the first step to understand how painful information is processed, integrated, and modulated, and it requires direct manipulation of specific brain regions. Nonhuman primates (NHP) offer an ideal model system to achieve these goals because cortical and subcortical regions in the NHP brain are established based on a variety of different types of data collected in a way that is not feasible or, at least, extremely difficult in humans (i.e., histology data, tract-tracing, intracerebral recordings). In addition, different methodological techniques can also help characterize and further understand these brain cortical and subcortical regions over the course of development. Here we used a heat nociceptive stimulation that is proven to elicit activity of nociceptive neurons in the cortex to refine and parcellate the whole brain nociceptive functional networks, to identify key network hubs, and to characterize network-wise temporal dynamic signatures using high-resolution fMRI. We first functionally localized 24 cortical and subcortical regions that responded to heat nociceptive stimuli (somatosensory area 1/2, area 3a/3b, S2, posterior insula (pIns), anterior insula, area 7b, posterior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex, caudate, and mediodorsal (MD) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei) and used them as seeds in resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data analysis. We applied both hierarchical clustering and graph-theory analyses of the pairwise rsfMRI correlation metrics and identified five cortical and one subcortical sub-networks: strong resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between ACC and prefrontal regions, parietal cortex and area 7b, S2 and posterior insula, areas 3a/3b and 1/2 within the S1 cortex, and thalamic MD and caudate nuclei. The rsFC strengths between cortical areas within each subnetwork were significantly stronger than those between subcortical regions. Regions within each sub-network also exhibited highly correlated temporal dynamics at rest, but the overall dynamic patterns varied drastically across sub-networks. Graph-theory analysis identified the MD nucleus as a hub that connects subcortical and cortical nociceptive sub-networks.

The regions are the cortical site of attentional expression, the thalamic enhancement structure, and the prefrontal area of control. It is also proposed that awareness of an object requires the additional component of attention directed to a representation of the self. The expression of attention to a self-representation may involve activations of cortical sites corresponding to the body landscape and/or verbal-based memories of autobiographical episodes. As in the case of attention to objects, attention to the self is presumed to involve a triangular circuit. The proposed triangular circuit of attention is shown to be generally consistent with current knowledge of brain structures and with data from a broad range of experiments concerned with the functions of neurons in these structures.

These regions are old in phylogeny and have widespread connections with eulaminate neocortices, intricately linking areas associated with emotion and cognition. The ACC and pOFC have distinct cortical and subcortical connections and are also interlinked, but the pattern of their connections-which may be used to infer the flow of information between them-is not well understood. Here we found that pathways from ACC area 32 innervated all pOFC areas with a significant proportion of large and efficient terminals, seen at the level of the system and the synapse. The pathway from area 32 targeted overwhelmingly elements of excitatory neurons in pOFC, with few postsynaptic sites found on presumed inhibitory neurons. Moreover, pathways from area 32 originated mostly in the upper layers and innervated preferentially the middle-deep layers of the least differentiated pOFC areas, in a pattern reminiscent of feedforward communication. Pathway terminations from area 32 overlapped in the deep layers of pOFC with output pathways that project to the thalamus and the amygdala, and may have cascading downstream effects on emotional and cognitive processes and their disruption in psychiatric disorders.","[Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel A.; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/K-4737-2019; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/0000-0003-0534-5182; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health [R01NS024760]; National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health [R01MH057414]; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center [NSF SBE-0354378]; Fundacion Alfonso Martin Escudero (Spain); NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation [22777]","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Fundacion Alfonso Martin Escudero (Spain); NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation(NARSAD)","This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health (Grant number R01NS024760); the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health (Grant number R01MH057414); and by Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (Grant number NSF SBE-0354378).

These are: extrinsic outputs, excitatory and inhibitory intrinsic connectivity, and intrinsic inputs. Supporting data are biased from the visual system of nonhuman primates (NHPs), but I have drawn as much as possible from a broader span in order to treat the important issue of area-specific variability. In a second part, I briefly discuss laminar connectivity in the context of network organization (feedforward/feedback cortical connections, and the major types of corticothalamic connections). I also point out anatomical issues in need of clarification, including more systematic, whole brain coverage of tracer injections; more data on anterogradely labeled terminations; more complete, area-specific quantitative data about projection neurons, and quantitative data on terminal density and convergence. Postsynaptic targets are largely unknown, but their identification is essential for understanding the finer analysis and principles of laminar patterns. Laminar resolution MRI offers a promising new tool for exploring laminar connectivity: it is potentially fast and macro-scale, and allows for repeated investigation under different stimulus conditions. Conversely, anatomical resolution, although detailed beyond the current level of MRI visualization, offers a rich trove for experimental design and interpretation of fMRI activation patterns.","[Rockland, Kathleen S.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Boston University","Rockland, KS (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St, Boston, MA 02118 USA.","krock@bu.edu",,"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785"," [MH106796];  [MH107456]","; ","I would like to thank Andrew Chang for help with manuscript preparation, and Dr. Christina Tognoni for assistance with figures.

This view not only afforded the mammillary bodies no independent role in memory, it also neglected the potential significance of other, nonhippocampal, inputs to the mammillary bodies. Recent advances have transformed the picture, revealing that projections from the tegmental nuclei of Gudden, and not the hippocampal formation, are critical for sustaining mammillary body function. By uncovering a role for the mammillary bodies that is independent of its subicular inputs, this work signals the need to consider a wider network of structures that form the neural bases of episodic memory.","[Vann, Seralynne D.; Nelson, Andrew J.

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that testosterone increases neural activity in the amygdala. To investigate whether this could be due to altered regulation of amygdala functioning which is thought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, we studied the effects of exogenous testosterone on the interaction between the amygdala and other brain regions. Healthy middle-aged women received a single nasal testosterone dose in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover manner, and performed an emotional face matching task while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI. The results show that testosterone rapidly reduced functional coupling of the amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex, and enhanced amygdala coupling with the thalamus. This suggests that testosterone may reduce the regulatory control over the amygdala, or that testosterone shifts amygdala output away from the orbitofrontal cortex towards the thalamus. Testosterone also reduced functional coupling with the contralateral amygdala. Because interhemispheric amygdala coupling is lower in men than in women, this result suggests that circulating testosterone may contribute to this sexual dimorphism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To reveal the anatomical substrate for these multimodal responses, we examined the connections of the primary auditory area + the anterior auditory field (A1 + AAF), the temporal anterior area (TA), and the primary visual area (V1). A1 + AAF had intrinsic connections and connections with TA, multimodal cortex (MM), V1, and primary somatosensory area (S1). TA had intrinsic connections and connections with A1 + AAF, MM, and V2. Callosal connections were observed in homotopic locations in auditory cortex for both fields. A1 + AAF and TA receive thalamic input primarily from divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus but also from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd), the lateral posterior nucleus, and the ventral posterior nucleus (VP). V1 had dense intrinsic connections and connections with V2, MM, auditory cortex, pyriform cortex (Pyr), and, in some cases, somatosensory cortex.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the pulvinar nucleus upon response properties of single cells in the second visual area (V2) of Cebus monkeys. The method used consisted of the inactivation of a portion of the lateral pulvinar by GABA injections while studying the response properties of cells in V2 at the same visuotopic location as that of the inactivation. 2. After GABA injection in the pulvinar, most cells in V2 (67%) showed changes in spontaneous and/or stimulus-driven activities. Contrary to the effect found with inactivation of the striate cortex, which promotes a reduction in the response of V2 neurons, we found that the main effect of pulvinar inactivation was an increment in stimulus-driven responses of V2 cells (39% of units studied). A reduction of responses was observed in 27% of units. 3. A change in orientation and/or direction selectivity was found in 91% of cells after inactivation of the pulvinar. Most commonly, the orientation selectivity of a neuron was decreased during pulvinar inactivation. 4. The inactivation results indicate that the pulvinar projections have a modulatory effect on the activity of V2 cells.","Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Programa Neurobiol, Lab Fisiol Cognicao,CCS, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro","Gattass, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Programa Neurobiol, Lab Fisiol Cognicao,CCS, Bloco G, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","rgattass@biof.ufrj.br","Soares, Juliana Guimarães Martins/A-7124-2013","Soares, Juliana Guimarães Martins/0000-0002-0408-8607",,,,,40,22,23,0,0,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1440-1681",,,"CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P","Clin.

A parametric analysis was applied to determine the effects of each of both factors as well as their interaction. Subjects performed four different cyclical movement tasks of increasing spatiotemporal complexity (i.e., unimanual left-right hand movements, bimanual in-phase movements, bimanual anti-phase movements, and bimanual 90degrees out-of-phase movements) across four frequency levels (0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 Hz). Results showed that, within the network involved in bimanual coordination, functional subcircuits could be distinguished: Activation in the supplementary motor area, superior parietal cortex (SPS), and thalamic VPL Nc was mainly correlated with increasing spatiotemporal complexity of the limb movements, suggesting that these areas are involved in higher-order movement control. By contrast, activation within the primary motor cortex, cingulate motor cortex (CMC), globus pallidus, and thalamic VLo Ne correlated mainly with movement frequency, indicating that these areas play an important role during movement execution. Interestingly, the cerebellum and the dorsal premotor cortex were identified as the principal regions responding to manipulation of both parameters and exhibiting clear interaction effects. Therefore, it is concluded that both areas represent critical sites for the control of bimanual coordination. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Rodent pulvinar, more commonly called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), consists of three highly-conserved subdivisions, and offers the advantage of simplicity in its study compared to more subdivided primate pulvinar. Little is known about receptive field properties of LP, let alone whether functional differences exist between different LP subdivisions, making it difficult to understand what visual information is relayed and what kinds of computations the pulvinar might support. Here, we characterized single-cell response properties in two V1 recipient subdivisions of rat pulvinar, the rostromedial (LPrm) and lateral (LPl), and found that a fourth of the cells were selective for orientation, compared to half in V1, and that LP tuning widths were significantly broader. Response latencies were also significantly longer and preferred size more than three times larger on average than in V1; the latter suggesting pulvinar as a source of spatial context to V1. Between subdivisons, LPl cells preferred higher temporal frequencies, whereas LPrm showed a greater degree of direction selectivity and pattern motion detection. Taken together with known differences in connectivity patterns, these results suggest two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in LPl related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in LPrm for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex. Significance Statement: The pulvinar has a perplexing role in visual cognition as no clear link has been found between the functional properties of its neurons and behavioral deficits that arise when it is damaged. The pulvinar, called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in rats, is a higher order thalamic relay with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. By characterizing single-cell response properties in anatomically distinct subdivisions we found two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in lateral LP related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in rostromedial LP for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex.

Insular connections between the second somatosensory area and retroinsular area of the parietal lobe have been documented. The insula was found to connect with the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus of the temporal lobe. It has an abundance of local intrainsular connections and projections to subdivisions of the cingulate gyrus. The insula has connections with the lateral, lateral basal, central, cortical and medial amygdaloid nuclei. It also connects with nonamygdaloid areas such as the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal, and periamygdaloid cortex. The thalamic taste area, the parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, projects fibers to the ipsilateral insular-opercular cortex. In the past decade, confirmation has been given to the insula as a visceral sensory area, visceral motor area, motor association area, vestibular area, and language area. Recent studies have expanded the role of the insula as a somatosensory area, emphasizing its multifaceted, sensory role.

In the present study, we investigated how ongoing and visually driven activity in magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P) and koniocellular (K) layers of the LGN are related to cortical state. We recorded extracellular spiking activity in the LGN simultaneously with local field potentials (LFP) in primary visual cortex, in sufentanil-anaesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that asynchronous cortical states (marked by low power in delta-band LFPs) are linked to high spike rates in K cells (but not P cells or M cells), on multisecond timescales. Cortical asynchrony precedes the increases in K cell spike rates by 1-3s, implying causality. At subsecond timescales, the spiking activity in many cells of all (M, P and K) classes is phase-locked to delta waves in the cortical LFP, and more cells are phase-locked during synchronous cortical states than during asynchronous cortical states. The switch from low-to-high spike rates in K cells does not degrade their visual signalling capacity. By contrast, during asynchronous cortical states, the fidelity of visual signals transmitted by K cells is improved, probably because K cell responses become less rectified.

Anatomical tracing studies in nonhuman primates reveal differences in connectivity across subregions of the OFC, but data on the connectivity of the human OFC remain limited. We applied meta-analytic connectivity modeling in order to examine which brain regions are most frequently coactivated with the medial and lateral portions of the OFC in published functional neuroimaging studies. The analysis revealed a clear divergence in the pattern of connectivity for the medial OFC (mOFC) and lateral OFC (lOFC) regions. The lOFC showed coactivations with a network of prefrontal regions and areas involved in cognitive functions including language and memory. In contrast, the mOFC showed connectivity with default mode, autonomic, and limbic regions. Convergent patterns of coactivations were observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. A small number of regions showed connectivity specific to the anterior or posterior sectors of the OFC. Task domains involving memory, semantic processing, face processing, and reward were additionally analyzed in order to identify the different patterns of OFC functional connectivity associated with specific cognitive and affective processes.

They have a large visual pulvinar complex, but its organization and relation to visual cortex is only partly known. We processed brain sections through the pulvinar with seven different procedures in an effort to reveal histologically distinct compartments. The results revealed three major subdivisions. A dorsal subdivision, Pc, stains darkly for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and occupies the dorsoposterior one-third of the pulvinar complex. A ventral subdivision, Pv, stains darkly when processed with the Cat-301 antibody and occupies the ventroanterior fifth of the pulvinar complex along the brachium of the superior colliculus. Unexpectedly, part of Pv is ventral to the brachium. A large central subdivision, Pc, stains moderately dark for AChE and cytochrome oxidase (CO), and very light for Cat-301. Pc includes about half of the pulvinar complex, with parts on both sides of the brachium of the superior colliculus. These architectonic results demonstrate that the pulvinar complex of tree shrews is larger and has more subdivisions than previously described. The complex resembles the pulvinar of primates by having a portion ventral to the brachium and by having histochemically distinct nuclei; the number of nuclei is less than in primates, however.

The outflow facility and the stained/unstained tissue were measured. Results: The outflow facility and the area under the curve (outflow) increased with the increasing number of thalamosinusotomy incisions (0 to 4). Thalamosinusotomy eyes showed more stained tissue (conjunctiva, outer sclera, inner sclera) than sham surgery eyes with significant statistical difference (P<0.05).

Here, we describe the distribution of retinal afferents to the dLGN of Tarsius, the single contemporary member of an ancient lineage of primates. In this genus, the more superficial layer of the dLGN receives projections from the ipsilateral eye, a unique situation among the members of the Order Primates.

However, whether this incertal connection represents a general mammalian pattern remains to be determined. We used neuronal tracers to examine the zona incerta connections with the midbrain tectum in the gray squirrel and macaque monkey. Collicular injections in both species revealed that most incertotectal neurons lay in the ventral layer, but anterogradely labeled tectoincertal terminals were found in both the dorsal and ventral layers. In the monkey, injections of the pretectum also produced retrograde labeling, but mainly in the dorsal layer. The dendritic fields of incertotectal and incertopretectal cells were generally contained within the layer inhabited by their somata. The macaque, but not the squirrel, zona incerta extended dorsolaterally, within the external medullary lamina. Zona incerta injections produced retrogradely labeled neurons in the superior colliculus of both species. In the squirrel, most cells inhabited the lower sublamina of the intermediate gray layer, but in the monkey, they were scattered throughout the deeper layers. Labeled cells were present among the pretectal nuclei in both species. Labeled terminals were concentrated in the lower sublamina of the intermediate gray layer of both species, but were dispersed among the pretectal nuclei. In summary, an incertal projection that is concentrated on the collicular motor output layers and that originates in the ventral layer of the ipsilateral zona incerta is a common mammalian feature, suggesting an important role in collicular function.","[May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [Basso, Michele A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fuster Lab Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci & Neurobiol, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Basso, Michele A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA","May, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.;May, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.;May, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.","pmay@umc.edu","May, Paul J/R-7564-2019",,"National Eye Institute of Health [EY019663]","National Eye Institute of Health","This manuscript is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Rick Chia-Sheng Lin, whose infectious enthusiasm for the zona incerta and all his other interests will be sorely missed.

All of these prefrontal areas were found to be targets of basal-ganglia output that originated in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and/or the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNpr). Approximately one-third of the total volume of these nuclei was directed toward prefrontal cortex, a volume comparable to that directed at the cortical motor areas. The origins of the outputs to different prefrontal areas were topographically organized. Different portions of SNpr (the rostral and caudal thirds) projected to areas 9m and 12l. Similarly, different output nuclei (GPi and SNpr) projected to adjacent portions of the same cytoarchitectonic field (46d and 46v). Furthermore, the outputs to prefrontal areas were segregated from those to motor areas of cortex. Thus, basal-ganglia outputs to prefrontal cortex are both extensive and topographically organized, forming a rich anatomical substrate for basal-ganglia influences on the cognitive operations of the frontal lobe.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg & Psychiat, Sch Med, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, W1640 Biomed Sci Tower,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.","strickp@pitt.edu","Muselli, Alain/D-6840-2013","Muselli, Alain/0000-0002-0031-1621; Middleton, Frank/0000-0002-3107-7188","NIMH NIH HHS [MH11262, MH56661] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,62,331,338,0,10,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Based on data from behavioral and neuroimaging studies, it has been proposed that the reversal is due to a conflict between anatomical and spatial representations of the tactile signal or to the production of an inverted apparent motion signal. Because the alpha rhythms, which consist of a few distinct components, reportedly modulate tactile perception and apparent motion and serve as a 10 Hztimer, we hypothesized that the illusory reversal would be regulated by some of the alpha rhythms. To test this hypothesis, we conducted magnetoencephalographic recordings in both male and female participants during the tactile temporal order judgment task. We decomposed the alpha rhythms into five independent components and discovered that the illusory reversal was modulated by the phase of one independent component with strong current sources near the parieto-occipital (PO) sulcus (peri-PO component). As expected, the estimated current sources distributed over the human MST implicated to represent tactile apparent motion, in addition to the intraparietal region implicated in mapping tactile signals in space. However, the strongest source was located in the precuneus that occupies a central hub region in the cortical networks and receives tactile inputs through a tecto-thalamic pathway. These results suggest that the peri-PO component plays an essential role in regulating tactile temporal perception by modulating the thalamic nuclei that interconnect the superior colliculus with the cortical networks.","[Takahashi, Toshimitsu; Kitazawa, Shigeru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Dynam Brain Network Lab, 1-3 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Takahashi, Toshimitsu; Kitazawa, Shigeru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Brain Physiol, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kitazawa, Shigeru] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kitazawa, Shigeru] Osaka Univ, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Osaka University; Osaka University; National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan; Osaka University","Kitazawa, S (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Dynam Brain Network Lab, 1-3 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.","kitazawa@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp",,," [25119002];  [25240022]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H02890, 25119002] Funding Source: KAKEN","; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas 25119002 and (A) 25240022 to S.K.

We Sought to ascertain how regions postulated to be abnormal in bipolar and unipolar disorders were functionally connected to the rest of the brain, and how this associativity differed from healthy controls. Thirty patients with bipolar disorder (Bps), 34 patients with Unipolar disorder (Ups), and 66 healthy volunteers (Willis, M.W., Benson, B.

Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 164 (1)) were imaged using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) while performing an auditory continuous performance task (CPT). Five bilateral regions of interest (ROIs), namely dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, inferior parietal cortex (INFP), thalamus and cerebellum, were correlated with normalized cerebral metabolism in the rest of the brain while covarying out Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Scores. In bipolar patients compared with controls, metabolism in the left DLPFC and IN FP, and bilateral thalamus and insula had more positive and fewer negative metabolic correlations with other brain regions. In contrast, compared with controls, Unipolar patients had fewer significant correlative relationships, either positive or negative. In common, bipolar and unipolar patients lacked the normal inverse relationships between the DLPFC and cerebellum, as well as relationships between the primary ROIs and other limbic regions (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and temporal lobes) compared with controls. Associations of DLPFC and INFP with other brain areas were different in each hemisphere in patients and controls. Bipolar patients exhibited exaggerated positive coherence of activity throughout the brain, while unipolar patients showed a paucity of normal interrelationships compared with controls. These abnormal patterns of metabolic associativity suggest marked interregional neuronal dysregulation in bipolar and unipolar illness exists beyond that of mere absolute regional differences from control levels, and provides rationale for using acute and long-term therapies that may re-establish and maintain normal associativity in these devastating illnesses.

The high-affinity binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to each of the investigated 12 brain areas was saturable and apparently monophasic (e.g., apparent K-D value of 1.72 nM in the thalamus). The highest density of specific binding sites was observed in the thalamus (1,158 fmol/mg protein), and the lowest density was measured in the cerebellar gray matter (11 fmol/mg protein). An attempt to assess nAChR subtype specificity of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 was made by competitive autoradiography. Binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 coincubated with 2-F-A-85380, epibatidine, cytisine, or methyllycaconitine, respectively, indicated a specificity of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to beta 2-containing nAChRs in the porcine brain.

In the superior colliculus, these calcium-binding proteins show different distribution patterns throughout the layers. After reaction for calretinin one observes a heavy staining of the neuropil with few labeled cells in superficial layers, a greater number of large and medium-sized cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and small neurons in deep layers. The reaction for calbindin revealed a strong staining of neuropil with a large number of small and well stained cells, mainly in the upper half of the stratum griseum superficiale. Intermediate layers were more weakly stained and depicted few neurons. There were few immunopositive cells and little neuropil staining in deep layers. The reaction for parvalbumin showed small and medium-sized neurons in the superficial layers, a predominance of large stellate cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and medium-sized cells in the deep layers. In the lateral geniculate nucleus of Cebus, parvalbumin is found in the cells of both the P and M pathways, whereas calbindin is mainly found in the interlaminar and S layers, which are part of the third visual pathway. Calretinin was only found in cells located in layer S. This pattern is similar to that observed in Macaca, showing that these calcium-binding proteins reveal different components of the parallel visual pathways both in New and Old World monkeys.

Despite the widespread acceptance of tamoxifen as a therapeutic agent for this disease, its effects on other estrogen-dependent pathways, particularly on neural circuits regulating brain function and peripheral hormone secretion, are poorly understood. The present study, using previously ovariectomized rhesus monkeys, examined the effects of tamoxifen, in both the presence and absence of estradiol replacement, on the reproductive and hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes. In Experiment 1, monkeys randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8 each) were treated with placebo and either two doses of estradiol, two doses of tamoxifen alone, or two doses of tamoxifen plus high-dose estradiol to assess the effects on negative feedback suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH). Both doses of tamoxifen effectively antag-onized the negative feedback efficacy of estradiol on LH secretion. In contrast, neither the low- or high-dose tamoxifen alone had any effect on LH secretion, as con-centrations during tamoxifen treatments were indistinguishable from those during placebo. In Experiment 2, females were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (placebo, n = 6; estradiol, n = 5; tamoxifen only, n = 5; or tamoxifen plus estradiol, n = 6) to assess the effects on glucocorticoid negative feedback and pituitary and adrenal responsiveness to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Tamoxifen also antagonized the facilitating effects of estradiol on basal and CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol secretion. However, this antagonism produced basal and CRH-stimulated cortisol and ACTH concentrations that were lower than placebo-treated females. Interestingly, tamoxifen in the absence of estradiol produced a similar diminution in ACTH and cortisol response. These data suggest that, in the presence of estradiol, tamoxifen not only antagonized estrogenic facilitation of HPA responsivity but also actually attenuated the response compared with the placebo-treatment condition. Taken together, these data indicate that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist on the neural circuits controlling the neuroendocrine regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and adrenal axes in ovariectomized macaque females.","Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Psychobiol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; Emory Univ, Div Anim Resources, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; Emory Univ, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA","Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University","Wilson, ME (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Psychobiol, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.","markw@rmy.emory.edu","Felger, Jennifer C/E-1175-2011; Felger, Jennifer C/N-3034-2017","Felger, Jennifer C/0000-0003-4354-2267; ","NCRR NIH HHS [RR00165] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD38917] Funding Source: Medline","NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))",,,104,21,21,0,11,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1355-008X","1559-0100",,"ENDOCRINE","Endocrine","DEC",2003,22,3,,,,,305,315,,"10.1385/ENDO:22:3:305","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1385/ENDO:22:3:305"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1385/ENDO:22:3:305"")",,,11,"Endocrinology & Metabolism","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Endocrinology & Metabolism","766YW",14709804,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000188412200014","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000188412200014"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Deer mice were reared under either enriched or standard housing conditions for 60 days following weaning. All mice were then placed in automated photocell detectors and classified as either stereotypic or non-stereotypic. Neuronal metabolic activity was then assessed using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. The results demonstrated that environmental enrichment significantly increased neuronal metabolic activity in the motor cortex. Furthermore, non-stereotypic mice exhibited significantly more CO activity than stereotypic mice in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. This latter effect was due to the enriched mice as evidenced by a significant interaction between housing condition and behavioral status in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hippocampus. Thus, the observed increase in CO activity reflected increased neuronal metabolic activity in non-stereotypic enriched mice relative to stereotypic enriched mice. These results suggest that, in a developmental model of spontaneous stereotypy, the enrichment-related prevention of stereotyped behavior is associated with increased CO activity.

In order to understand further how auditory projections to AL contribute to emotional processing, acoustic response properties of single AL neurons were characterized in rats. Recordings were also made in the posterior striatum dorsal to AL. Many cells in AL and the striatum could be driven by broad-band auditory stimulation with white noise or clicks. Initial onset latencies were typically between 12 and 25 msec. Most cells also had later responses (60-150 msec), and a few only had late responses. In frequency receptive field tests, different classes of cells were identified. One group had relatively clear frequency preferences. Thresholds for these relatively tuned cells tended to be somewhat higher in AL than in the striatum. Frequency preferences for AL cells were always above 10 kHz. Although most striatal cells had preferences for frequencies above 10 kHz, some cells were found with frequencies below 10 kHz as well. A second group of acoustically responsive neurons, much more common in AL than in the striatum, showed no frequency specificity (untuned cells). These responded to a wide range of frequencies, even at intensities near threshold. A third group, found mainly in AL (approximately 60% of the total population of cells examined in AL), exhibited rapid habituation to auditory stimuli. These tended to have high thresholds (80-100 dB). Because these cells habituated so quickly, frequency specificity could not be determined. Responses in AL and the striatum were compared with responses in the specific auditory relay nucleus of the thalamus, the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, where cells had shorter onset latencies, narrower tuning functions, and lower-intensity thresholds than cells in AL and striatal areas.

The corticocortical projections to area 1 in squirrel monkeys were determined by placing multiple injections of anatomical tracers into separate body part representations defined by multiunit microelectrode mapping in area 1. The pattern of labeled cells in the cortex indicated that area 1 has strong intrinsic connections within each body part representation and has inputs from somatotopically matched regions of areas 3b, 3a, 2 and 5. Somatosensory areas in the lateral sulcus, including the second somatosensory area (S2), the parietal ventral area (PV), and the presumptive parietal rostral (PR) and ventral somatosensory (VS) areas, also project to area 1. Topographically organized projections to area 1 also came from the primary motor cortex (M1), the dorsal and ventral premotor areas (PMd and PMv), and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Labeled cells were also found in cingulate motor and sensory areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere.

Methods: Carbon-11-CFT (WIN 35,428, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropan), C-11-CCT (RTI-131, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-monochlorophenyl)tropane), and C-11-CDCT (dichloropane, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane) were evaluated as imaging probes for dopamine neurons in five normal and in two MPTP-treated cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) using a high-resolution PET imaging system (PCR-I). Results: For C-11-CFT, the specific binding ratio (as defined by the ratio of radioactivity levels in striatum versus cerebellum) was 4.2 +/- 0.8 in caudate and 4.9 +/- 1.2 in putamen at 60 min and 4.9 +/- 1.2 and 5.5 +/- 1.1 at 90 min in control animals. In MPTP-treated monkeys the corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.5 +/- 0.1 in putamen at 60 min and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.4 +/- 0.3 in putamen at 90 min. For the monochloro analog of CFT, C-11-CCT, the ratios in control caudate and putamen were 2.7 +/- 0.4 and 3.4 +/- 0.3, respectively, at 60 min and 3.7 +/- 0.5 and 4.4 +/- 0.6, respectively, at 90 min. In MPTP-treated animals, corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.5 +/- 0.3 at 60 min and 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.4 at 90 min. The dichloro analog of CFT, CDCT, which has the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter, generated the lowest ratios in control brains, 2.3 +/- 0.4 in caudate and 2.4 +/- 0.5 in putamen at 60 min. In one MPTP-treated monkey, the corresponding ratios were 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.3. In comparison with C-11-CFT, both C-11-CCT and C-11-CDCT were less selective and had high uptake in the thalamus. Conclusion: The present results clearly indicate that C-11-CFT is a useful ligand for monitoring dopamine neuronal degeneration.","ORGANIX INC, WOBURN, MA USA; HARVARD UNIV, SCH MED, SOUTHBOROUGH, MA 01772 USA; NEW ENGLAND REG PRIMATE RES CTR, SOUTHBOROUGH, MA USA","Harvard University","Brownell, AL (corresponding author), MASSACHUSETTS GEN HOSP, DEPT RADIOL, PHYS RES LAB, EDWARDS BLDG, 5TH FLOOR, BOSTON, MA 02114 USA.",,,,"NCI NIH HHS [CA 32873-11] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHS [DA 06303] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 30556] Funding Source: Medline","NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,39,38,42,0,0,"SOC NUCLEAR MEDICINE INC","RESTON","1850 SAMUEL MORSE DR, RESTON, VA 20190-5316 USA","0161-5505","1535-5667",,"J NUCL MED","J.

The neural mechanism underlying this sex difference is unknown. However, Bingel et al. (2007) have shown that pain habituation after 8 days of daily pain testing is associated with an increase in pain-evoked activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), suggesting that pain habituation may be mediated via connectivity between the sgACC and the descending pain antinociceptive system. Therefore, we investigated whether women have stronger functional connectivity (FC) and greater structural connectivity (SC) compared to men between the sgACC and the descending antinociceptive system. Our analyses revealed that 1) women exhibited greater FC between the sgACC and the periaqueductal gray (PAG), raphe nucleus, medial thalamus, and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) than men; 2) men had stronger sgACC FC with the anterior insula and temporoparietal junction than women; 3) women and men exhibited comparable SC of the sgACC with the PAG, thalamus, aMCC, anterior insula, and amygdala; and 4) men have stronger sgACC SC with the hypothalamus than women. These data indicate that brain circuitry in women may provide for greater engagement of the descending modulation system mediating pain habituation. In contrast, in men, the salience network may be more engaged, which could support greater sustained attention to pain, thereby preventing pain habituation. Furthermore, the hypothalamus findings suggest a more powerful stress and endorphin-based system at play in men than women. (C) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Previous research shows that perceived angular size alters the spatial distribution of activity in early retinotopic visual cortex [7, 9-11]. For example, a sphere superimposed on the far end of a corridor scene appears to occupy a larger visual angle and activates a larger region of primary visual cortex (V1) compared with the same sphere superimposed on the near end of the corridor [7]. These previous results, however, were obtained from human subjects using psychophysics and fMRI, a fact that fundamentally limits our understanding of the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Here, we present an animal model that allows for a finer examination of size perception at the level of single neurons. We first show that macaque monkeys perceive a size-distance illusion similarly to humans. Then, using extracellular recordings, we test the specific hypothesis [12] that neurons in V1 shift the position of their receptive fields (RFs) in response to complex monocular depth cues. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that when ring-shaped stimuli appeared at the back of the corridor, RFs of V1 neurons shifted toward the center of the rings. When the same stimuli appeared at the front of the corridor, RFs shifted outward. Thus, our results show for the first time that V1 RFs can shift, potentially serving as the neural basis for the perception of angular size.","[Ni, Amy M.; Horwitz, Gregory D.] Univ Washington, Natl Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ni, Amy M.; Horwitz, Gregory D.] Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Murray, Scott O.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Murray, SO (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","somurray@uw.edu",,"Horwitz, Gregory/0000-0001-5130-5259","National Eye Institute [EY020622]","National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))","All procedures concerning human subjects were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board, and all procedures concerning monkey subjects were approved by the University of Washington, Animal Care and Use Committee.

These effects are thought to be due to facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical connections. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the spatial spread of responses to visual stimulation in human early visual cortex. The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil was administered to normal healthy human subjects to increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil decreased the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in visual cortex, consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive field size of cortical neurons. Donepezil also reduced response amplitude in visual cortex, but the cholinergic effects on spatial spread were not a direct result of reduced amplitude.

The pulvinar forms extensive connections with striate and extrastriate cortical areas, but the impact of these connections on cortical circuits has not previously been directly tested. Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and in vitro physiological techniques in male and female mice, we show that pulvinocortical terminals are densely distributed in the extrastriate cortex where they form synaptic connections with spines and small-diameter dendrites. Optogenetic activation of these synapses in vitro evoked large excitatory postsynaptic responses in the majority of pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and interneurons within the extrastriate cortex. However, specificity in pulvinar targeting was revealed when recordings were targeted to projection neuron subtypes. The neurons most responsive to pulvinar input were those that project to the striatum and amygdala (76% responsive) or V1 (55%), whereas neurons that project to the superior colliculus were rarely responsive (6%). Because the pulvinar also projects directly to the striatum and amygdala, these results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement.

Results from intracellular injections of neighboring neurons (in rats: Johnson et al., 2000) suggest that even neurons within a common domain may have non-stereotyped projection patterns, with only partial overlap of terminal arbors. The issue of non-stereotyped projections at the columnar level is further considered by analysis of V1 axons terminating in primate area MT/V5 (an early visual area), and of an axon from temporal cortex terminating in area 7b (a higher cortical area). Both these axons have multiple non-uniform arbors. The implication is that each arbor recruits different numbers and possibly different combinations of postsynaptic elements. While more data are needed concerning convergence of connectional systems, and the actual identity and numbers of postsynaptic targets, the distributed spatial and laminar patterns do not evoke a repetitive uniformity, but rather a columnar substructure and the combinatoric possibilities of the 3-dimensional cortical organization.","RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","RIKEN","Rockland, KS (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.","rockland@brain.riken.go.jp",,"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785",,,,,35,22,23,0,1,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-4864",,,"J NEUROCYTOL","J.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a delayed match-to-sample task, we show that the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, thalamus, and caudate are engaged during evaluation of the spatial locations of noxious stimuli. Thus, brain mechanisms supporting discrimination of sensory features of pain extend far beyond the somatosensory cortices and involve frontal regions traditionally associated with affective processing and the medial pain system. These frontoparietal interactions are similar to those involved in the processing of innocuous information and may be critically involved in placing afferent sensory information into a personal historical context.","Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Study Pharmacol Plast Presence Pain, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University","Coghill, RC (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 300 S Hawthorne Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.","rcoghill@wfubmc.edu",,"Quevedo, Alexandre/0000-0001-5613-8015","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS39426, R01 NS039426] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,44,98,98,0,4,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

It is now clear that higher primates have four strip-like representations of skin and muscle receptors corresponding to areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2 of anterior parietal cortex. Areas 3 b and 1 receive cutaneous information from the ventroposterior nucleus, while a ventroposterior superior nucleus provides areas 3 a and 2 with information from muscle receptors. Area 3 b is the homolog of S-I in prosimians and non-primates and it provides most of the activating cutaneous inputs to areas 1 and 2. Most of the further processing that allows tactile recognition of objects involves somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus, where both S-II and the parietal ventral area (PV) receive activating inputs from areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2. S-II also projects to PV and to a parietal rostral area where further connections with the amygdala and hippocampus may occur to allow the formation of tactile memories. Areas of anterior parietal cortex also project to posterior parietal cortex, where regions of cortex are largely somatosensory, but the functional subdivisions remain uncertain.

The subiculum represents a laminar organization according to the location of pyramidal cells that project to the different subcortical nuclei; the most superficial portion of the pyramidal cell layer projects to the nucleus accumbens, the mid-portion of the layer projects to the medial nucleus of the mammillary body, and the deepest portion of the layer projects to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus. This laminar arrangement is consistently found along the entire septotemporal and proximodistal axes of the subiculum. Thus, these connectional data indicate that there is a distinct sublamination of the subicular pyramidal cell layer which has led to the suggestion that the subiculum may be analogous to the infragranular layer (layers V and VI) of the isocortex. Subsequently, the dentate gyrus and the hippocampus proper may be regarded as the supragranular layers (layers II and III), since the principal cells of these fields give off no descending projections. This proposed hypothesis is discussed from connectional as well as developmental, pathological and chemo-architectural points of view.

High-field functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was used to study the central processing of brief air-pulses, delivered to the peritonsillar region of the lateral oropharynx, in six healthy adults. Bilateral air-pulse stimulation was associated with the activation of a bilateral network including the primary somatosensory cortex and the thalamus, classic motor areas (primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, cingulate motor areas), and polymodal areas (including the insula and frontal cortex). These results suggest that oropharyngeal stimulation can activate a bilaterally distributed cortical network that overlaps cortical regions previously implicated in oral and pharyngeal sensorimotor functions such as tongue movement, mastication, and swallowing. The present study also demonstrates the utility of air-pulse stimulation in investigating oropharyngeal sensorimotor processing in functional brain imaging experiments.

We here show that latexin-expressing neurons exhibit ultrastructural features common to cortical pyramidal neurons. We show in combined retrograde tracing and immunofluorescent experiments that latexin-expressing neurons contribute to specific cortico-cortical pathways. Thus, injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold into either the primary somatosensory (SI) or the primary motor (MI) cortical area labeled many latexin expressing neurons in the infragranular layers of the secondary somatosensory (SII) and visceral sensory (Vi) areas. In contrast, tracer injections involving the thalamus, striatum, or contralateral SII and Vi exclusively labeled latexin-nonexpressing neurons in both the SII and Vi. Finally, we show that the correct corticocortical projections can be formed in organotypic slice cultures in vitro from latexin-expressing neurons: when slices of developing SII were cocultured with those from the SI and the thalamus, latexin-immunoreactive neurons in the SII projected preferentially to their normal SI target. The specific connectivity formed in vivo and in vitro by this molecularly distinct neuronal population reveals its characteristic manner of cortical organization and provides a unique model system to analyze mechanisms underlying the formation of precise corticocortical pathways.","Mitsubishi Kasei Inst Life Sci, Machida, Tokyo 1948511, Japan",,"Arimatsu, Y (corresponding author), Mitsubishi Kasei Inst Life Sci, 11 Minamiooya, Machida, Tokyo 1948511, Japan.",,,,,,,,53,39,39,0,1,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Horizontal and vertical small-field optokinetic stimulation activated the same multiple visual, ocular motor and vestibular cortical and subcortical areas in both hemispheres. The extent of activation in each hemisphere was independent of the stimulus direction. All activated areas representing cortical (occipitotemporal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, precentral and posterior median frontal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, medial part of the superior frontal gyrus) and subcortical (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and paramedian thalamus) ocular motor structures were activated during optokinetic stimulation as well as during fixation suppression of optokinetic nystagmus. However, the activation was significantly stronger with optokinetc nystagmus compared with fixation suppression. The only relatively increased activity during fixation suppression was seen in the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (supplementary eye field) and the anterior cingulate gyrus. The anterior insula and the posterior insula (human homologue of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex) were activated during optokinetic nystagmus but not during fixation suppression. A significant right hemispheric predominance (regardless of stimulus direction) was found under both conditions in the visual motion-sensitive and ocular motor areas of the cortex, except the supplementary eye field and anterior cingulate gyrus. This was most prominent in the occipitotemporal cortex, but did not occur in the primary visual cortex and in subcortical ocular motor structures (putamen, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus), Thus, cortical and subcortical activation patterns did not differ for horizontal and vertical optokinetic stimulation, and there was distinct right-hemisphere dominance for visual motion-sensitive and cortical ocular motor areas and the thalamus. Fixation suppression of optokinetic nystagmus yielded four different results: (i) increased activation in the supplementary eye field and anterior cingulate gyrus; (ii) unchanged activation in the visual cortex; (iii) decreased activation in most of the ocular motor areas; and (iv) suppressed activation in the anterior and posterior insula and the thalamus. Activation of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex may be related to ocular motor function rather than self-motion perception.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neuroradiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany","University of Munich; University of Munich","Dieterich, M (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.","mdieterich@brain.nefo.uni-muenchen.de",,,,,,,70,145,146,0,11,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","AUG",1998,121,,8,,,,1479,1495,,"10.1093/brain/121.8.1479","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.8.1479"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.8.1479"")",,,17,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","111BM",9712010,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000075417500009","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000075417500009"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Material and Methods - The neuro-otological and neuro-radiological records of 179 patients clinically diagnosed as having SCD (91 males, 88 females; age range 20-89 years) and 48 patients diagnosed as having peripheral vestibular disorders (15 males, 33 females; age range 21-80 years) were reviewed. Subjects underwent caloric tests using cold water (20degreesC) in a totally dark room. Immediately after each test session, subjects were asked if they had experienced spinning or moving sensations during the test. Maximum slow phase eye velocities (SPEVs) were measured using electronystagmography. Results - Among patients with peripheral vestibular disorders, all patients with SPEVs >15degrees/s experienced spinning or moving sensations during testing. Among the 179 patients with SCD, 21 (39 sides) showed maximum SPEVs >15degrees/s without spinning or moving sensations.

However, its functional role in the higher visual cortex remains unclear. Here, we observed visual cortical area activity in anesthetized mice to evaluate the role of the extrageniculate pathway on their specialized visual properties. Results: The preferred stimulus velocities of neurons in the higher visual areas (lateromedial [LM], anterolateral [AL], anteromedial [AM], and rostrolateral [RL] areas) were measured using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging and two-photon calcium imaging and were higher than those in the primary visual cortex (V1). Further, the velocity-tuning properties of the higher visual areas were different from each other. The response activities in these areas decreased after V1 ablation; however, the visual properties' differences were preserved. After SC destruction, these preferences for high velocities disappeared, and their tuning profiles became similar to that of the V1, whereas the tuning profile of the V1 remained relatively normal. Neural tracer experiments revealed that each of these higher visual areas connected with specific subregions of the LPN. Conclusions: The preservation of visual property differences among the higher visual areas following V1 lesions and their loss following SC lesions indicate that pathways from the SC through the thalamus to higher cortical areas are sufficient to support these differences.","[Tohmi, Manavu; Tsukano, Hiroaki; Hishida, Ryuichi; Shibuki, Katsuei] Niigata Univ, Dept Neurophysiol, Brain Res Inst, Chuo Ku, Niigata 9518585, Japan; [Meguro, Reiko] Niigata Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Chuo Ku, Niigata 9518510, Japan","Niigata University; Niigata University","Tohmi, M (corresponding author), Niigata Univ, Dept Neurophysiol, Brain Res Inst, Chuo Ku, 1-757 Asahi Machi, Niigata 9518585, Japan.","tomi@bri.niigata-u.ac.jp","Tsukano, Hiroaki/G-5053-2013","Tsukano, Hiroaki/0000-0001-8511-7256","Japanese Government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23500383] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from the Japanese Government.

Its very fast uptake and clearance from the brain contrasts with that of methylphenidate, another drug that inhibits the DA transporter. Methylphenidate clears from the brain at a much slower rate and is less addictive than cocaine. We postulate that periodic and frequent stimulation of the dopaminergic system secondary to chronic use of cocaine favors activation of a circuit that involves the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, thalamus and striatum. This circuit is abnormal in cocaine abusers and we postulate that its activation by cocaine perpetuates the compulsive administration of the drug and is perceived by the cocaine abuser as a intense desire resulting in the loss of control over the drive to take more cocaine.","BROOKHAVEN NATL LAB,DEPT CHEM,UPTON,NY 11973; SUNY STONY BROOK,DEPT PSYCHIAT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook","Volkow, ND (corresponding author), BROOKHAVEN NATL LAB,DEPT MED,UPTON,NY 11973, USA.",,,,"NIDA NIH HHS [5RO1-DA06891, 1RO1-DA09490-01] Funding Source: Medline","NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA))",,,49,94,95,2,13,"HAWORTH PRESS INC","BINGHAMTON","10 ALICE ST, BINGHAMTON, NY 13904-1580","1055-0887",,,"J ADDICT DIS","J.

However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets, compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse. Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas (https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain. riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular organization for primate brain research.

In addition, a small and heterogeneous collection of ganglion cell axons projects to the koniocellular layers of the LGN, to the superior colliculus (SC), and to other subcortical targets. The functional (receptive field) properties and target specificity of these non-parvocellular, non-magnocellular populations remain poorly understood. It is known that one population of koniocellular layer cells in the LGN (blue-On cells) receives dominant functional input from short-wavelength sensitive (S or 'blue') cones. Here we asked whether SC neurones also receive S cone inputs. We made extracellular recordings from single neurones (n = 38) in the SC of anaesthetised marmoset monkeys. Responses to drifting and flashed gratings providing defined levels of cone contrast were measured. The SC receptive fields we recorded were often binocular, showed 'complex cell' like responses (On-Off responses), strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, direction selectivity, and many showed strong and rapid habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli. We found no evidence for dominant S cone input to any SC neurone recorded. These data suggest that S cone signals may reach cortical pathways for colour vision exclusively through the koniocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus.","[Tailby, Chris; Cheong, Soon Keen; Pietersen, Alexander N.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia; [Tailby, Chris; Solomon, Samuel G.] Florey Neurosci Inst Austin, Brain Res Inst, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Cheong, Soon Keen; Pietersen, Alexander N.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia; [Solomon, Samuel G.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Physiol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney; Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of Sydney; University of Sydney","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst C09, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","prmartin@sydney.edu.au","Tailby, Chris/C-2801-2013; Solomon, Samuel G/C-8779-2009; Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009; Tailby, Chris JD/K-4096-2015","Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Tailby, Chris JD/0000-0002-1320-5924; Solomon, Samuel/0000-0001-5321-0288","Australian NHMRC grant [1027913]; Australian Research Council grant [CE0561903]","Australian NHMRC grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council grant(Australian Research Council)","We thank B.

We focus on the process of working memory, based on circuit mechanisms for attending to relevant signals and suppressing irrelevant stimuli. We discuss that connections critically depend on the systematic variation in laminar structure across all cortical systems. Laminar structure is used to group areas into types regardless of their placement in the cortex, ranging from low-type agranular areas that lack layer IV to high-type areas that have six well-delineated layers. Connections vary in laminar distribution and strength based on the difference in type between linked areas, according to the structural model (Barbas H, Rempel-Clower N. Cereb Cortex 7: 635-646, 1997). The many possible pathways thus vary systematically by laminar distribution and strength, and they interface with excitatory neurons to select relevant stimuli and with functionally distinct inhibitory neurons that suppress activity at the site of termination. Using prefrontal pathways, we discuss how systematic architectonic variation gives rise to diverse pathways that can be recruited, along with amygdalar and hippocampal pathways that provide sensory, affective, and contextual information. The prefrontal cortex is also connected with thalamic nuclei that receive the output of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which may facilitate fast sequencing of information. The complement of connections and their interface with distinct inhibitory neurons allows dynamic recruitment of areas and shifts in cortical rhythms to meet rapidly changing demands of sequential components of working memory tasks.","[Barbas, Helen; Wang, Jingyi; Joyce, Mary Kate P.; Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel Angel] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen; Wang, Jingyi; Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel Angel] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen; Joyce, Mary Kate P.] Boston Univ, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University; Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Rm 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/K-4737-2019; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/0000-0003-0534-5182; ","National Institutes of Health [R01MH057414, R01NS024760]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation 2014 National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia & Depression Young Investigator Grant [22777]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Brain and Behavior Research Foundation 2014 National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia & Depression Young Investigator Grant","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01MH057414 and R01NS024760.

Their precise location, however, remains in dispute. For example, taste stimulation activates areas throughout the insula and overlying operculum, but identification of subregions has been inconsistent. Furthermore, literature reviews and summaries of gustatory brain activations tend to reiterate rather than resolve this ambiguity. Here, we used a new meta-analytic method [activation likelihood estimation (ALE)] to obtain a probability map of the location of gustatory brain activation across 15 studies. The map of activation likelihood values can also serve as a source of independent coordinates for future region-of-interest analyses. We observed significant cortical activation probabilities in: bilateral anterior insula and overlying frontal operculum, bilateral mid dorsal insula and overlying Rolandic operculum, and bilateral posterior insula/parietal operculum/postcentral gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right medial OFC, pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex (prACC) and right mediodorsal thalamus. This analysis confirms the involvement of multiple cortical areas within insula and overlying operculum in gustatory processing and provides a functional tastemap which can be used as an inclusive mask in the data analyses of future studies. In light of this new analysis, we discuss human central processing of gustatory stimuli and identify topics where increased research effort is warranted. Hum Brain Mapp 32:2256-2266, 2011.

The purpose of the current study was to examine a hormonal basis for this sex difference. Cross-sectional neuronal areas of the MGN were measured in male rats, untreated female rats and female rats treated perinatally with testosterone propionate, all of which had received either neonatal cortical freezing or sham injury Both male and androgenized female rats with microgyria had significantly smaller MGN neurons when compared to their sham-operated counterparts, whereas untreated females with microgyria did not. These differences were also reflected in MGN neuronal size distribution: both male and androgenized female rats with microgyria had more small and fewer large neurons in their MGN in comparison to shams, while there was no difference in MGN neuronal size distribution between lesioned and sham females. These findings suggest that perinatal gonadal steroids mediate the sex difference in thalamic response to induction of microgyria in the rat cortex.","Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Dyslexia Res Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Charles A Dana Res Inst, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Behav Neurol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Rosen, GD (corresponding author), Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Dyslexia Res Lab, 330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,"Rosen, Glenn/0000-0001-8281-5446","NICHD NIH HHS [HD20806] Funding Source: Medline","NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))",,,54,52,53,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Unfortunately, dMRI fiber mapping is an indirect method that relies on inference from measured diffusion patterns. Comparing dMRI results with other modalities is a way to improve the interpretation of dMRI data and help advance dMRI technologies. Here, we present methods for comparing dMRI fiber orientation estimates with optical imaging of fluorescently labeled neurofilaments and vasculature in 3D human and primate brain tissue cuboids cleared using CLARITY. The recent advancements in tissue clearing provide a new opportunity to histologically map fibers projecting in 3D, which represents a captivating complement to dMRI measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the capability to directly compare dMRI and CLARITY in the same human brain tissue and assess multiple approaches for extracting fiber orientation estimates from CLARITY data. We estimate the three-dimensional neuronal fiber and vasculature orientations from neurofilament and vasculature stained CLARITY images by calculating the tertiary eigenvector of structure tensors. We then extend CLARITY orientation estimates to an orientation distribution function (ODF) formalism by summing multiple sub-voxel structure tensor orientation estimates. In a sample containing part of the human thalamus, there is a mean angular difference of 19 degrees +/- 15 degrees between the primary eigenvectors of the dMRI tensors and the tertiary eigenvectors from the CLARITY neurofilament stain. We also demonstrate evidence that vascular compartments do not affect the dMRI orientation estimates by showing an apparent lack of correspondence (mean angular difference = 49 degrees +/- 23 degrees) between the orientation of the dMRI tensors and the structure tensors in the vasculature stained CLARITY images. In a macaque brain dataset, we examine how the CLARITY feature extraction depends on the chosen feature extraction parameters. By varying the volume of tissue over which the structure tensor estimates are derived, we show that orientation estimates are noisier with more spurious ODF peaks for sub-voxels below 30 mu m(3) and that, for our data, the optimal gray matter sub-voxel size is between 62.5 mu m(3) and 125 mu m(3). The example experiments presented here represent an important advancement towards robust multi-modal MRI-CLARITY comparisons.","[Leuze, C.; Goubran, M.; Barakovic, M.; Tian, Q.; Weber, E. M.

They discharge during both action execution and action observation and appear to play a crucial role in understanding others' actions. It has been proposed that the mirror mechanism is based on a match between the visual description of actions, encoded in temporal cortical regions, and their motor representation, provided by PMv and IPL. However, neurons responding to action observation have been recently found in other cortical regions, suggesting that the mirror mechanism relies on a wider network. Here we provide the first description of this network by injecting neural tracers into physiologically identified IPL and PMv sectors containing hand MNs. Our results show that these sectors are reciprocally connected, in line with the current view, but IPL MN sectors showed virtually no direct connection with temporal visual areas. In addition, we found that PMv and IPL MN sectors share connections with several cortical regions, including the dorsal and mesial premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the mid-dorsal insula and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as subcortical structures, such as motor and polysensory thalamic nuclei and the mid-dorsal claustrum. We propose that each of these regions constitutes a node of an extended network, through which information relative to ongoing movements, social context, environmental contingencies, abstract rules, and internal states can influence MN activity and contribute to several socio-cognitive functions.","[Bruni, Stefania; Gerbella, Marzio; Bonini, Luca; Borra, Elena; Ferrari, Pier Francesco; Fogassi, Leonardo; Maranesi, Monica; Roda, Francesca; Serventi, Francesca Ugolotti; Rozzi, Stefano] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Unit Neurosci, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy; [Bruni, Stefania] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gerbella, Marzio] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Biomol Nanotechnol, I-73010 Lecce, Italy; [Coude, Gino; Ferrari, Pier Francesco] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Inst Sci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, CNRS, UMR 5229, 67 Bd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France; [Simone, Luciano] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Translat Neurophysiol, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy","University of Parma; Baylor College of Medicine; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT","Rozzi, S (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Unit Neurosci, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy.","stefano.rozzi@unipr.it","Bonini, Luca/AFI-1651-2022; , l_bonini/O-5010-2018; Bruni, Stefania/AAB-4498-2019; Simone, Luciano/AAS-1957-2020; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; FOGASSI, Leonardo/K-3541-2018",", l_bonini/0000-0002-3485-2127; Bruni, Stefania/0000-0002-0299-215X; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Simone, Luciano/0000-0001-7493-6707; Roda', Francesca/0000-0003-4740-8743; FOGASSI, Leonardo/0000-0003-3348-039X; Maranesi, Monica/0000-0002-8090-3300","European Commission; Italian PRIN [2010MEFNF7]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)","European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Italian PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)(Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT)","The research was supported by the European Commission Grant Cogsystems (FP7-250013), Italian PRIN (prot. 2010MEFNF7), Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11, and Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT).

Based on primate studies, the PPC is composed of several subdivisions with differing connection patterns, including areas that exhibit retinotopy. In mice the composition of the PPC is still under debate. We propose a revised anatomical delineation in which we classify the higher order visual areas rostrolateral area (RL), anteromedial area (AM), and Medio-Medial-Anterior cortex (MMA) as subregions of the mouse PPC. Retrograde and anterograde tracing revealed connectivity, characteristic for primate PPC, with sensory, retrosplenial, orbitofrontal, cingulate and motor cortex, as well as with several thalamic nuclei and the superior colliculus in the mouse. Regarding cortical input, RL receives major input from the somatosensory barrel field, while AM receives more input from the trunk, whereas MMA receives strong inputs from retrosplenial, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices. These input differences suggest that each posterior PPC subregion may have a distinct function. Summarized, we put forward a refined cortical map, including a mouse PPC that contains at least 6 subregions, RL, AM, MMA and PtP, MPta, LPta/A. These anatomical results set the stage for a more detailed understanding about the role that the PPC and its subdivisions play in multisensory integration-based behavior in mice.","[Gilissen, Sara R.

Discharge patterns of neurons are regulated by synaptic inputs and by intrinsic membrane properties such as their complement of ionic conductances. Discharge patterns evoked by synaptic inputs are often used to identify the source and modality of sensory input. However, the interpretation of these discharge patterns may be complicated if different neurons respond to the same synaptic input with a variety of discharge patterns due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties. The purposes of this study were 1) to investigate intrinsic discharge patterns of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of raccoon in vivo and 2) to use somatosensory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of forepaw digits to determine thalamocortical connectivity for the same neurons. 2. Conventional intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes were made from 121 neurons in the cortical representation of glabrous skin of digit four (d4). Intracellular injection of identical current pulses (100-120 ms in duration) elicited various patterns of discharge in different neurons. Neurons were classified on the basis of these intrinsic patterns of discharge, rates of spike adaptation, and characteristics of spike waveforms. Three main groups were identified: regular spiking (RS) neurons, intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons, and fast spiking (FS) neurons. Subclasses were identified for the RS and IB groups. 3. Neurons were tested for somatosensory inputs by stimulating electrically d3, d4, and d5. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited in 100% of the neurons by electrical stimulation of d4, the ''on-focus'' digit. EPSPs were usually followed by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Many neurons (41%) responded with EPSP-IPSP sequences after stimulation of d3 or d5, the ''off-focus'' digits. 4. Latencies of somatosensory EPSPs and IPSPs were used to determine the synaptic order in the cortical circuitry of RS, IB, and FS neurons. EPSPs with monosynaptic thalamocortical latencies were recorded in RS, IB, and FS neurons. 5. We conclude that precise patterns of neural discharge in primary somatosensory cortex cannot be reliable estimates of sensory inputs reaching these neurons because patterns of discharge are so strongly influenced by intrinsic membrane properties. Ionic conductances governing patterns of neuronal discharge seem almost identical in intact cortex of raccoon, rat, and cat, and in slices of rodent cortex, because similar patterns of discharge are found. The consistency of patterns of discharge across species and types of preparation suggests that these intrinsic membrane properties are a general property of cerebral cortical neurons and should be considered when evaluating sensory coding by these neurons.","QUEENS UNIV,DEPT PHYSIOL,MRC,SENSORY MOTOR PHYSIOL GRP,KINGSTON,ON K7L 3N6,CANADA","Queens University - Canada",,,,,,,,,58,22,22,0,3,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

However, significant gaps remain in our understanding how deprivation influences the development of visual acuity in mice. Here, we perform a longitudinal study assessing the effects of chronic deprivation on the development of the mouse subcortical and cortical visual circuits using a combination of behavioral optomotor testing, in vivo visual evoked responses (VEP) and single-unit cortical recordings. As previously reported, orientation tuning was degraded and onset of ocular dominance plasticity was delayed and remained open in chronically deprived mice. Surprisingly, we found that the development of optomotor threshold and VEP acuity can occur in an experience-independent manner, although at a significantly slower rate. Moreover, monocular deprivation elicited amblyopia only during a discrete period of development in the dark. The rate of recovery of optomotor threshold upon exposure of deprived mice to light confirmed a maturational transition regardless of visual input. Together our results revealed a dissociable developmental trajectory for visual receptive-field properties in dark-reared mice suggesting a differential role for spontaneous activity within thalamocortical and intracortical circuits.","Childrens Hosp, FM Kirby Neurobiol Ctr, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Harvard University; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Fagiolini, M (corresponding author), Boston Childrens Hosp, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","Chinfei.chen@childrens.harvard.edu; michela.fagiolini@childrens.harvard.edu","Hensch, Takao/L-4182-2019; Kang, Erin/AFM-0751-2022","Kang, Erin/0000-0002-4702-1103; fagiolini, michela/0000-0003-2807-803X","NIH [R01EY012613, P01HD18655]; RIKEN Brain Science Institute (T.K.H.)","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); RIKEN Brain Science Institute (T.K.H.)","This work was supported by NIH R01EY012613 (to E.K.,C.C., M.F.), P01HD18655 (to C.C., T.

The anterograde tracers Fluoro-Ruby (FR), Alexa Fluor (AT), and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into physiologically identified regions of rat SI. Injection locations were confirmed by examining the SI barrel fields and limb representations in tangential sections processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Experimental animals were divided into two groups: one group received multiple tracer injections in neighboring SI regions that represent separate body parts (whiskers, forepaw, and hindpaw); the other group received injections in SI areas that represent different components of the forelimb (forepaw, antebrachium, and brachium). The distribution of labeled terminals and their varicosities in the neostriatum and in the thalamus were plotted and quantitatively analyzed. For most animals, tracer overlap in the thalamus was either minimal or completely absent. In the neostriatum, projections from the whisker, forelimb, and hindlimb representations terminated in regions that rarely overlap with each other, while those originating from different parts of the forelimb representation were more likely to terminate in overlapping parts of the neostriatum. To the extent that neostriatal activation depends on corticostriatal convergence, the corticostriatal projections in the sensorimotor channel appeared to be organized so that neostriatal neurons may signal when multiple components of the same body part are activated simultaneously.","Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA","Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Millersville University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health","Alloway, KD (corresponding author), Milton S Hershey Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci H109, 500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.","kdal@psu.edu",,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS-37532] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,55,49,49,0,1,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

We investigated the cerebral representation of chronic lateralised ongoing pain in patients with painful mononeuropathy (PMN, i.e., pain in the distribution of a nerve, neuralgia) with positron emission tomography (PET), using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as an index for neuronal activity. Eight patients (29-53 years) with PMN in the lower extremity (4 in the right, 4 in the left) were recruited. Paired comparisons of rCBF were made between the patient's habitual pain (HP) state and the pain alleviated (PA) state following a successful regional nerve block (RNB) with lidocaine. The ongoing neuropathic pain resulted in activation of bilateral anterior insula, posterior parietal, lateral inferior prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices as well as the posterior sector of the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann area (BA) 24, regardless of the side of PMN. In addition, a reduction in rCBF was noted in the contralateral posterior thalamus. No significant change of rCBF was detected in the somatosensory areas, i.e., SI and SII. The cerebral activation pattern, while addressing the differences between the HP and PA states, emphasises the affective-motivational dimension in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain. The striking preferential activation of the right ACC (BA 24), regardless of the side of the PMN, not only confirms that the ACC participates in the sensorial/affectional aspect of the pain experience but also suggests a possible right hemispheric lateralisation of the ACC for affective processing in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain. Our data suggests that the brain employs different central mechanisms for chronic neuropathic pain and experimentally induced acute pain, respectively.","KAROLINSKA INST, KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT CLIN NEUROPHYSIOL, CLIN NEUROPHYSIOL SECT, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA INST, KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT ANESTHESIOL & INTENS CARE, PAIN SECT, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA INST, KAROLINSKA HOSP, KAROLINSKA PHARM, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA INST, KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT REHABIL MED, NEUROGEN PAIN UNIT, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; VET GEN HOSP, DEPT ANESTHESIOL, NEUROANESTHESIA PAIN UNIT, TAIPEI 11217, TAIWAN; NATL YANG MING UNIV, SCH MED, TAIPEI 11217, TAIWAN","Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University",,,,"Hansson, Per/0000-0001-9534-5826; Hsieh, Jen-Chuen/0000-0002-7568-000X; Ingvar, Martin/0000-0002-9041-5714",,,,,90,456,464,0,15,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0304-3959","1872-6623",,"PAIN","Pain","NOV",1995,63,2,,,,,225,236,,"10.1016/0304-3959(95)00048-W","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(95)00048-W"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(95)00048-W"")",,,12,"Anesthesiology; Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Anesthesiology; Neurosciences & Neurology","TG134",8628589,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1995TG13400012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1995TG13400012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Interplay between the two systems underlies the sensory and emotional aspects of pain, and was explored here in humans with simultaneous recordings from the amygdala, posterior and anterior insulae. Onsets of thermo-nociceptive responses were virtually identical in the posterior insula and the amygdalar complex, but no significant functional connectivity was detected between them using coherence analysis. Anterior insular sectors responded with similar to 30 ms delay relative to both the posterior insula and the amygdala. While intra-insular functional correlation was significant during the whole analysis period, coherence between the anterior insula and the amygdala became significant after 700 ms of processing. Phase lags indicated information transfer initially directed from the amygdalar complex to the insula. Parallel but independent activation of sensory and limbic nociceptive networks appear to converge in the anterior insula in less than one second. While the anterior insula is often considered as providing input into the limbic system, our results underscore its reverse role, i.e., receiving and integrating very rapidly limbic with sensory input, to initiate a perceptual decision on the stimulus 'painfulness'.","[Bastuji, Helene; Frot, Maud; Perchet, Caroline; Hagiwara, Koichi; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] INSERM, U1028, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Cent Integrat Pain NeuroPain Lab, F-69677 Bron, France; [Bastuji, Helene; Frot, Maud; Perchet, Caroline; Hagiwara, Koichi; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Univ Claude Bernard, CNRS, UMR5292, F-69677 Bron, France; [Bastuji, Helene] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonctionnelle & Epileptol, Unite Hypnol, F-69677 Bron, France; [Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Hop Neurol, Ctr Evaluat & Traitement Douleur, Lyon, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon","Bastuji, H (corresponding author), INSERM, U1028, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Cent Integrat Pain NeuroPain Lab, F-69677 Bron, France.;Bastuji, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard, CNRS, UMR5292, F-69677 Bron, France.;Bastuji, H (corresponding author), Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonctionnelle & Epileptol, Unite Hypnol, F-69677 Bron, France.","bastuji@univ-lyon1.fr","FROT, Maud/S-8930-2019","FROT, Maud/0000-0002-7783-9256; Garcia-Larrea, Luis/0000-0002-9873-789X; BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707","French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy [2012-14]; LABEX CORTEX [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship; INSERM Clinical-Research Interface Grant","French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy; LABEX CORTEX; Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship; INSERM Clinical-Research Interface Grant","Supported by the French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy (Translational Research Grant 2012-14), the LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042; ANR-11-IDEX-0007), and a Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship.

Eight subjects, all of whom described themselves as reactive to aversive sounds, participated in the study. Relative to white noise, the aversive sounds produced significant rCBF increases in the lateral amygdala/claustrum. region. Significant activations also localized to the dorsal brainstem, medial temporal pole, basal forebrain (nucleus accumbens), insula, right auditory association cortices, putamen, thalamus and cerebellum.

Following the initial observations on disorders of action and affect (apathy, abulia, lack of motivation) due to selective, bilateral damage to the globus pallidus, has arised the notion that these patients may have a specific impairment in converting affect into action, a condition usefully referred to as 'athymhormic' syndrome. Such patients are totally inactive spontaneously, with dramatically reduced spontaneous mental activity, but show normal motor and intellectual functioning on external stimulations. The anatomical substrate is thought to involve a corticosubcortical limbic circuit connecting the limbic striato-pallidum to the medial thalamus, then to the medial frontal cortex. Bilateral lesions at either location on this circuit are necessary and sufficient to produce the athymhormic syndrome. Besides its obvious physiological and clinical importance, the introduction in clinical neuropsychology of these new conceptions may have interesting implications for the understanding of certain psychiatric conditions.","CHU Timone, Serv Neurol, F-13385 Marseille 5, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille",,"rnp@univ-aix.fr",,,,,,,71,4,4,0,1,"ADRSC-ASSOC DIFFUSION RECHERCHES SCIENCES COGNITIVES","MARSEILLE CEDEX 20","C N R S-C R N C, 31, CHEMIN JOSEPH ALGUIER, 13402 MARSEILLE CEDEX 20, FRANCE","1155-4452",,,"REV NEUROPSYCHOL","Rev.

In particular, it is unknown to what extent responses evoked by an external stimulus are general or already sensitive to certain stimuli. In the present study, we recorded high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) in 19 neonates, tested ten weeks before term (28-32 weeks gestational age (wGA), that is, at an average age of 30 wGA) by means of a syllable discrimination task (i.e., a phonetic change: ba vs. ga; and a voice change: male vs. female voice). We first observed that the syllables elicited 4 peaks with distinct topographies implying a progression of the sensory input along a processing hierarchy; second, repetition induced a decrease in the amplitude (repetition suppression) of these peaks, but their latencies and topographies remained stable; and third, a change of stimulus generated mismatch responses, which were more precisely time-locked to event onset in the case of a phonetic change than in the case of a voice change. A hierarchical and parallel functional architecture is therefore able to process environmental sounds in a timely precise fashion, well before term birth. This elaborate functional architecture at the onset of extrinsic neural activity suggests that specialized areas weakly dependent on the environment are present in the perisylvian region as part of the genetic endowment of the human species.","[Mahmoudzadeh, Mahdi; Wallois, Fabrice; Kongolo, Guy; Goudjil, Sabrina] Univ Picardie, CHU Nord, INSERM, U1105,GRAMFC, F-80000 Amiens, France; [Dehaene-Lambertz, Ghislaine] Univ Paris Sud, Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS,NeuroSpin Ctr, CEA DSV I2BM,INSERM,Neuroimaging Unit, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); CHU Amiens; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Mahmoudzadeh, M (corresponding author), INSERM U1105, Fac Med, 3 rue Louvels, F-80036 Amiens, France.","mahdi.mahmoudzadeh@u-picardie.fr","Dehaene, Ghislaine/O-3633-2017","Dehaene, Ghislaine/0000-0003-2221-9081","Picardie regional council; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [604102]","Picardie regional council(Region Hauts-de-France); European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU))","This work was supported by the Picardie regional council.

Retrograde transneuronal transport of the CVS-11 (challenge virus strain 11) strain of rabies virus in cerebello-thalamocortical pathways revealed that the arm area of M1 receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in lobules IV-VI of the cerebellar cortex. In contrast, transneuronal transport of rabies from area 46 revealed that it receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in Crus II of the ansiform lobule. Thus, both M1 and area 46 are the targets of output from the cerebellar cortex. However, the output to each area of the cerebral cortex originates from Purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex. Anterograde transneuronal transport of the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) revealed that neurons in the arm area of M1 project via the pons to granule cells primarily in lobules IV-VI, whereas neurons in area 46 project to granule cells primarily in Crus II. Together, the findings from rabies and HSV1 experiments indicate that the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from M1 are the same as those that project to M1. Similarly, the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from area 46 are the same as those that project to area 46. Thus, our observations suggest that multiple closed-loop circuits represent a fundamental architectural feature of cerebrocerebellar interactions.","Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Salk Institute; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, W1640 Biomed Sci Tower,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.","strickp@pitt.edu",,,"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH056661, MH56661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS024328, NS24328] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,56,1070,1083,0,55,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The primary auditory area (AI) occupies the cortex of the supratemporal plane (STP) and is surrounded by auditory association areas in circular sulcus and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Architectonic studies have parcellated auditory areas into a number of subregions. Beginning from the temporal polar proisocortex up to the parietal cortex, these areas shows progressive laminar differentiation, and are arranged into three parallel lines. The most medial line occupies the cortex of the circular sulcus. The regions of this line maintains limbic features and is termed as root line. Another line is located in STG. The regions of this line show progressive emphasis in the third and fourth layer neurons and is termed as belt line. Interposed between root and belt line is a core line located in STP. In this line there is greater accumulation of fourth layer neurons. Recent physiological studies have outlined several auditory representations surrounding AI. These auditory representations correspond to above mentioned architectonic subregions of STR. The subregions within each line have bidirectional connectional laminar specificity. The feedforward connections originate from the supragranular layer Ill and terminate in and around layer IV of the rostrally adjacent region. Feedback projections in constrast stem from the infragranular layers and terminate in layer I. The long association connections of auditory areas are with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the multimodal areas and the limbic regions, and are derived from belt and root line areas of STR. These projections follow the rostro-caudal architectonic differentiation of STR. Thus the rostral STG areas are mainly connected with orbital and medial PFC areas whereas the caudal STG areas are connected with caudal PFC. The intermediate STG areas are preferentially related to the lateral PFC regions. It seems that STG-PFC connections are betwen the areas with similar level of architectonic differentiation. The thalamic connections of the subregions of STR also follow the architectonic organizations. The core line areas are preferentially related to ventral nucleus (MGv) of medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) whereas the root and belt line areas are connected respectively to magnocellular (MGmc) and dorsal (MGd) subdivisions of MGN. The root and belt areas share some connections and are also related to pulvinar, suprageniculate, dorsomedial and intralaminar nuclei. It seems therefore that progressive laminar and tripartrate organization of auditory regions of STR is reflected in intrinsic, association and thalamic connections. The feedforward connections may be engaged in analysis of external environmental cues whereas feedback connections may have a role in matching learned or stored information with incoming auditory signals. The preferential core line connectivity with MGv may be involved in spectral analysis of sound whereas the connections of the belt and root areas with MGmc, MGd, and pulvinar may have role in sound pattern recognition, auditory memory, the localization of sound in space as well as matching auditory information with other modalities.","BOSTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,BOSTON,MA 02118; BOSTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROL,BOSTON,MA 02118; HARVARD UNIV,BETH ISRAEL HOSP,NEUROL UNIT,BOSTON,MA 02215","Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center","PANDYA, DN (corresponding author), EDITH NOURSE ROGERS MEM VET ADM HOSP,200 SPRINGS RD,BEDFORD,MA 01730, USA.",,,,"PHS HHS [N516841] Funding Source: Medline","PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,60,154,157,0,11,"MASSON EDITEUR","PARIS 06","120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE","0035-3787",,,"REV NEUROL","Rev.

This study assessed whether such atrophy is correlated with loss of gray matter volume in other brain regions. In 16 patients with TLE and clear magnetic resonance imaging-based evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal volumes were determined manually and the local gray matter (LGM) amount was estimated throughout the entire brain using voxel-based morphometry. Voxel-wise correlations between the volume of the sclerotic hippocampus and LGM were computed. The pattern of voxels whose LGM correlated with hippocampal volume outlined remarkably well the anatomy of the extended limbic system and included the parahippocampal region, cingulate gyrus throughout its extent, basal fore-brain, thalamic nuclei, medial orbitofrontal areas and the insula. These correlations emerged mainly on the side ipsilateral to the affected hippocampus but were also found contralaterally. No such correlations were found in a group of 16 healthy controls. The present data show that hippocampal volume loss in TLE is associated with a widespread limbic systems atrophy. These findings are helpful to better understand the functional deficit and reorganization often found in temporal lobe epilepsy and will also provide a basis to assess neural plasticity in the limbic system for those patients who will undergo curative temporal lobe surgery.","Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Neurol 2, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; UCL, Inst Child Hlth, London, England; Great Ormond St Hosp Sick Children, London WC1N 1EH, England","Otto von Guericke University; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust","Duzel, E (corresponding author), Otto Von Guericke Univ, Dept Neurol 2, Leipziger Str 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.","duezel@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de","Duzel, Emrah/A-1794-2010","Duzel, Emrah/0000-0002-0139-5388; Schiltz, Kolja/0000-0003-3788-3241",,,,,47,41,41,0,3,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0340-5354","1432-1459",,"J NEUROL","J.

In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain, although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge, for example on visual processing, has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second, they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge, such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals, particularly in the realm of sensory perception, remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys, and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge signals.","NEI, NIH, Sensorimotor Res Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)","Wurtz, RH (corresponding author), NEI, NIH, Sensorimotor Res Lab, Bldg 49,Room 2A50,MSC 4435,9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,,,,,,,63,62,62,0,1,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"0-444-50978-X","PROG BRAIN RES",,,2003,144,,,,,,47,60,,"10.1016/S0079-6123(03)14400-3","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6123(03)14400-3"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6123(03)14400-3"")",,,14,"Neurosciences","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","BY05P",,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000187421400003","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000187421400003"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes in a same-different matching task was higher when subjects selectively attended to one attribute than when they divided attention among the attributes. PET measurements of brain activity indicated that modulations of extrastriate visual activity were primarily produced by task conditions of selective attention. Attention to speed activated a region in the left inferior parietal lobule. Attention to color activated a region in the collateral sulcus and dorsolateral occipital cortex, while attention to shape activated collateral sulcus (similarly to color), fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, and temporal cortex along the superior temporal sulcus. Outside the visual system, selective and divided attention activated nonoverlapping sets of brain regions. Selective conditions activated globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior thalamus/colliculus, and insular-premotor regions, while the divided condition activated the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results in the visual system demonstrate that selective attention to different features modulates activity in distinct regions of extrastriate cortex that appear to be specialized for processing the selected feature. The disjoint pattern of activations in extravisual brain regions during selective- and divided-attention conditions also suggests that perceptual judgments involve different neural systems, depending on attentional strategies.","WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL & NEUROL SURG, BOX 8111, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA; WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, MCDONNELL CTR STUDY HIGHER BRAIN FUNCT, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA; UNIV IOWA, DEPT NEUROL, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA","Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); University of Iowa",,,"Corbetta, Maurizio/AAZ-5219-2020; Petersen, Steve/ABF-1368-2020","CORBETTA, MAURIZIO/0000-0001-8295-3304",,,,,133,1308,1321,1,85,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

However, the neural mechanisms supporting these interactions remain poorly understood. By using combined psychophysical and functional MRI techniques, brain activation related to the intensity of expected pain and experienced pain was characterized. As the magnitude of expected pain increased, activation increased in the thalamus, insula, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other brain regions. Pain-intensity-related brain activation was identified in a widely distributed set of brain regions but overlapped partially with expectation-related activation in regions, including the anterior insula and ACC. When expected pain was manipulated, expectations of decreased pain powerfully reduced both the subjective experience of pain and activation of pain-related brain regions, such as the primary somatosensory cortex, insular cortex, and ACC. These results confirm that a mental representation of an impending sensory event can significantly shape neural processes that underlie the formulation of the actual sensory experience and provide insight as to how positive expectations diminish the severity of chronic disease states.","Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Div Radiol Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Study Pharmacol Plast Presence Pain, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA","Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University","Coghill, RC (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.","rcoghill@wfubmc.edu","Koyama, Tetsuo/ABA-7456-2021","KOYAMA, Tetsuo/0000-0002-1838-0684","NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS039426, R01 NS39426] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,54,463,477,0,62,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424",,,"P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

The present study examined SAI in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and uninjured controls. Methods: Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was evoked by stimulating the median nerve at the elbow at intervals of 15, 20 and 25 ms in advance of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse over M1. SAI was tested with the FCR at rest and also during similar to 20% of maximum voluntary contraction. Corticospinal output was assessed through measuring both motor thresholds and motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves. The afferent volley was assessed via the N20-P25 amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and the amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) recorded over the median nerve at the elbow. Results: SAI is reduced in SCI in both the contracted and non-contracted FCR muscle. MEP recruitment curves and thresholds were decreased in SCI only in the active state and not the resting state. N20-P25 amplitude was similar between groups in both the resting and active states although SNAP was significantly reduced in SCI at rest. Conclusions: We conclude that reduced SAI in SCI is likely attributed to neuroplasticity altering the intrinsic M1 circuitry mediating SAI and/or reduced afferent input traversing a direct thalamocortical route to M1. These data provide a new avenue of research aimed at identifying therapeutic approaches to alter SAI to improve upper limb function in individuals with SCI.","[Bailey, Aaron Z.; Mi, Yiqun P.; Nelson, Aimee J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Hamilton, ON, Canada","McMaster University","Bailey, AZ (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Hamilton, ON, Canada.","nelsonaj@mcmaster.ca",,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)","The authors report no conflict of interests.

The cortical regions occupied by these maps are generally believed to be determined initially by genetically controlled chemical markers during development, with thalamocortical afferent activity subsequently exerting a progressively increasing influence over time. Here we use a computational model to show that adjacent topographic maps with mirror-image symmetry can arise from activity-dependent synaptic changes whenever the distribution radius of afferents sufficiently exceeds that of horizontal intracortical interactions. Which map edges become adjacent is strongly influenced by the probability distribution of input stimuli during map formation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent synaptic changes may play a role in influencing how adjacent maps become Oriented following the initial establishment of cortical areas via genetically determined chemical markers. Further, the model unexpectedly predicts the occasional occurrence of adjacent maps with a different rotational symmetry. We speculate that such atypically oriented maps, in the context of otherwise normally interconnected cortical regions, might contribute to abnormal cortical information processing in some neurodevelopmental disorders.","Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Neurol, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Schulz, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","rschulz@cs.umd.edu; reggia@cs.umd.edu","Schulz, Reiner/A-5940-2011; Schulz, Reiner/H-4451-2011","Schulz, Reiner/0000-0001-5047-7921; ","NINDS NIH HHS [NS35466] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,63,4,4,1,1,"M I T PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","FIVE CAMBRIDGE CENTER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA","0899-7667",,,"NEURAL COMPUT","Neural Comput.","MAY",2005,17,5,,,,,1059,1083,,"10.1162/0899766053491904","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0899766053491904"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0899766053491904"")",,,25,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Neurosciences & Neurology","914ZM",15829100,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000228267400005","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000228267400005"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

This work aims to characterize the kinetic properties of an alpha(7)-nAChR-specific radioligand, 7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-[F-18]-fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide ([F-18]DBT-10), in nonhuman primates. Methods [F-18]DBT-10 was produced via nucleophilic substitution of the nitro-precursor. Four Macaca mulatta subjects were imaged with [F-18]DBT-10 PET, with measurement of [F-18]DBT-10 parent concentrations and metabolism in arterial plasma. Baseline PET scans were acquired for all subjects. Following one scan, ex vivo analysis of brain tissue was performed to inspect for radiolabeled metabolites in brain. Three blocking scans with 0.69 and 1.24 mg/kg of the alpha(7)-nAChR-specific ligand ASEM were also acquired to assess dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding. Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed using the metabolite-corrected input function to calculate the parent fraction corrected total distribution volume (V (T)/f (P)). Results [F-18]DBT-10 was produced within 90 min at high specific activities of 428 +/- 436 GBq/mu mol at end of synthesis. Metabolism of [F-18]DBT-10 varied across subjects, stabilizing by 120 min post-injection at parent fractions of 15-55 %. Uptake of [F-18]DBT-10 in brain occurred rapidly, reaching peak standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 2.9-3.7 within 30 min. The plasma-free fraction was 18.8 +/- 3.4 %. No evidence for radiolabeled [F-18]DBT-10 metabolites was found in ex vivo brain tissue samples. Kinetic analysis of PET data was best described by the two-tissue compartment model. Estimated V (T)/f (P) values were 193-376 ml/cm(3) across regions, with regional rank order of thalamus > frontal cortex > striatum > hippocampus > occipital cortex > cerebellum > pons. Dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding by structural analog ASEM was observed throughout the brain, and occupancy plots yielded a V (ND)/f (P) estimate of 20 +/- 16 ml/cm(3). Conclusion These results demonstrate suitable kinetic properties of [F-18]DBT-10 for in vivo quantification of alpha(7)-nAChR binding in nonhuman primates.","[Hillmer, Ansel T.; Zheng, Ming-Qiang; Li, Songye; Lin, Shu-fei; Holden, Daniel; Labaree, David; Ropchan, Jim; Carson, Richard E.; Huang, Yiyun] Yale Univ, PET Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Scheunemann, Matthias; Teodoro, Rodrigo; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiopharmaceut Canc Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Yale University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR)","Hillmer, AT (corresponding author), Yale Univ, PET Ctr, 801 Howard Ave,POB 208048, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","ansel.hillmer@yale.edu","Carson, Richard E/H-3250-2011; , Ansel/AAV-6622-2020","Carson, Richard E/0000-0002-9338-7966; , Ansel/0000-0002-8105-1381; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie/0000-0003-3168-3062; , Peter/0000-0001-5555-7058","NIH [T32 DA022975]; National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) [UL1 TR000142]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS))","This work was supported by NIH T32 DA022975.

Methods Healthy controls and migraineurs were categorized according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Photophobia was measured under full-field illumination using electromyography in response to narrowband lights spanning the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra. Migraineurs were tested during their interictal headache-free period. Melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil responses quantified intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cell (ipRGC) function. Results A model combining the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra best described photophobia thresholds in controls and migraineurs; melanopsin contributions were similar to 1.5x greater than cone luminance. In the illumination range causing photophobia, migraineurs had lower photophobia thresholds (similar to 0.55 log units; p < 0.001) and higher post-illumination pupil response amplitudes (p = 0.03) than controls. Conclusion Photophobia is driven by melanopsin and cone luminance inputs to the cortex via the retino-thalamocortical pathway. In migraineurs, lower photophobia thresholds reflect hypersensitivity of ipRGC and cone luminance pathways, with the larger and prolonged post-illumination pupil response amplitude indicative of a supranormal melanopsin response. Our findings inform artificial lighting strategies incorporating luminaires with low melanopsin excitation and photopic luminance to limit the lighting conditions leading to photophobia.","[Zele, Andrew J.; Dey, Ashim; Adhikari, Prakash; Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Vis & Eye Res, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Zele, Andrew J.; Adhikari, Prakash] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dey, Ashim; Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Eye Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland Eye Institute","Feigl, B (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Vis & Eye Res, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.","b.feigl@qut.edu.au","Adhikari, Prakash/AFO-8162-2022","Adhikari, Prakash/0000-0003-4834-8500",,,,,53,11,11,0,2,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0333-1024","1468-2982",,"CEPHALALGIA","Cephalalgia","FEB",2021,41,2,,,,,217,226,,"10.1177/0333102420963850","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0333102420963850"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0333102420963850"")",,,10,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","QC0UH",33040593,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000614549100009","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000614549100009"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Individuals with facilitated pain processing and/or reduced pain-modulatory capabilities are regarded as pronociceptive, whereas individuals with reduced pain processing capacity are characterized as antinociceptive. Brodmann area (BA) 3a of the primary somatosensory cortex is part of an ascending pathway from the sensory thalamus that mediates TSP. Descending pain modulation involves projections from the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to the periaqueductal gray to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Here, we tested the hypothesis that pronociceptive individuals have an enhanced TSP response compared with antinociceptive individuals, marked by facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and/or reduced capacity for descending pain modulation. Eighty healthy humans were tested with a TSP protocol and underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found large interindividual differences in TSP responses, which were positively correlated with functional connectivity (FC) between individuals' right sensory thalamus with their BA 3a (thal-BA 3a), and with cortical thickness in their insula and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, TSP was negatively correlated with FC between individuals' RVM with their sgACC (RVM-sgACC). When subjects were grouped as pronociceptive or antinociceptive based on whether they had greater thal-BA 3a or RVM-sgACC FC respectively, pronociceptive subjects showed greater TSP responses. Furthermore, TSP was positively correlated with the extent of imbalance toward ascending nociceptive processing. Our study indicates that individuals with enhanced TSP have facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and reduced pain-modulatory capacities.","[Cheng, Joshua C.; Erpelding, Nathalie; Kucyi, Aaron; DeSouza, Danielle D.; Davis, Karen D.] Toronto Western Hosp, Div Brain Imaging & Behav Syst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Cheng, Joshua C.; Kucyi, Aaron; DeSouza, Danielle D.; Davis, Karen D.] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada; [Davis, Karen D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Toronto, ON M5T 1P5, Canada","University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto","Davis, KD (corresponding author), Toronto Western Hosp, 399 Bathurst St,Room MP14-306, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.","kdavis@uhnres.utoronto.ca","DeSouza, Danielle/J-9821-2019","DeSouza, Danielle/0000-0001-6861-5691; Cheng, Joshua/0000-0002-4305-4792","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 10626]; Queen Elizabeth II/Purdue Pharma Scholarship in Science and Technology; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg [PDR-09-023]","Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Queen Elizabeth II/Purdue Pharma Scholarship in Science and Technology; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund)","This work was funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 10626).

Methods-Positron emission tomography was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in response to an acute experimental pain stimulus in six patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in comparison to six age and sex matched controls. A standardised and reproducible non-painful and painful phasic heat stimulus was delivered by a thermal probe to the back of the right hand during six two minute periods during which time measurements were made. The of non-painful heat were subtracted from those of painful heat to the analysis towards the nondiscriminatory or 'suffering' components of pain processing. Significance maps of pain processing were generated and compared in each group and contrasted with results obtained in a group of patients with atypical facial pain (AFP) that have been previously published. Results-The RA patients showed remarkably damped cortical and subcortical responses to pain compared with the control group. Significant differences between the two groups were observed in the prefrontal (BA 10) and anterior cingulate (BA 24) and cingulofrontal transition cortical (BA 32) areas. The reduced anterior cingulate responses to standardised heat pain were compared with the increased cingulate responses seen in patients with psychogenically maintained pain (AFP) who had both lower pain tolerance and mood than the RA group. Conclusions-Major cortical adaptive responses to standardised noxious heat can be measured and contrasted in patients with different types of chronic pain. The different pattern of cingulate and frontal cortical responses in the patients with inflammatory and nonnociceptive pain suggest that different mechanisms are operating, possibly at a thalamocortical level. Implications for treatment strategies for chronic pain are discussed.","UNIV PITTSBURGH,MED CTR,DEPT RADIOL,PET FACIL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15260","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Jones, AKP (corresponding author), UNIV MANCHESTER,HOPE HOSP,CTR RHEUMAT DIS,HUMAN PHYSIOL & PAIN RES LAB,CLIN SCI BLDG,SALFORD M6 8HD,LANCS,ENGLAND.",,,"Jones, Anthony/0000-0001-6944-9365; Derbyshire, Stuart/0000-0002-2766-3424",,,,,53,73,76,0,1,"BRITISH MED JOURNAL PUBL GROUP","LONDON","BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND WC1H 9JR","0003-4967",,,"ANN RHEUM DIS","Ann.

In this study, we examined in vitro the modulatory influence of acetylcholine (ACh) on the responses of SGS neurons that project to the visual thalamus in the rat. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recording to measure the responses of these projection neurons to electrical stimulation of their afferents in the stratum opticum (SO) before and during local pressure injections of ACh. These colliculothalamic projection neurons (CTNs) were identified during the in vitro experiments by prelabeling them from the thalamus with the retrograde axonal tracer wheat germ agglutinin-apo-HRP-gold. In a group of cells that included the prelabeled neurons, EPSCs evoked by SO stimulation were significantly reduced by the application of ACh, whereas IPSC amplitudes were significantly enhanced. Similar effects were observed when the nicotinic ACh receptor agonist lobeline was used. Application of the selective GABA(B) receptor antagonist 3-[[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-methyl]amino]propyl]( diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid blocked ACh-induced reduction in the evoked response. In contrast, the ACh-induced reduction was insensitive to application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. The ACh-induced reduction was also diminished by bath application of muscimol at the low concentrations that selectively activate GABA(C) receptors. Because GABA(C) receptors may be specifically expressed by GABAergic SGS interneurons (Schmidt et al., 2001), our results support the hypothesis that ACh reduces CTN activity by nicotinic receptor-mediated excitation of local GABAergic interneurons. These interneurons in turn use GABA(B) receptors to inhibit the CTNs.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Zool & Neurobiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA","Ruhr University Bochum; Duke University","Schmidt, M (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Zool & Neurobiol, N D 6-25, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.","mschmidt@neurobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY08233] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,59,52,53,0,1,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

However, functional connectivity must rely on structural connections. In this study we applied a novel probabilistic fiber tracking method to assess the structural connectivity between the amygdala and different prefrontal brain regions in vivo. Twenty healthy subjects were investigated with diffusion tensor imaging. Probabilistic fiber tracking was started from the amygdala and different prefrontal brain regions. Resulting probability maps were combined using an extended multiplication of probabilistic maps to identify the most probable anatomical pathways connecting these structures. We found one ventral pathway through the uncinate fascicle, connecting the amygdala and the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. In addition to this ventral pathway, we depicted distinct dorsal pathways (medial and lateral), which connect the amygdala with the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The dorso-medial pathway proceeds through the inferior thalamic peduncle, while the dorsolateral pathway travels through the external capsule. We believe that our approach provides a promising tool to assess the integrity of specific structural connections in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In macaque monkeys, a disconnection of prefrontal and temporal cortex produces severe new learning impairments in a range of complex learning tasks such as visuo-motor conditional learning and object-in-place scene learning. The retrograde effects of this disconnection, however, have never been fully examined. We therefore assessed the postoperative retention of 128 preoperatively learned object discrimination problems in monkeys with prefrontal-temporal disconnection using 1 trial postoperative retention tests. Because previous experiments have suggested that both spatial and temporal factors may be important in engaging frontal-temporal interaction we used object discrimination problems with a variety of spatial and temporal properties. Postoperatively, although monkeys with prefrontal-temporal disconnection displayed a retrograde amnesia for all problem types, subsequent assessments of new learning revealed selective anterogracle amnesia, which was limited to problems in which objects were presented as serial compound stimuli. The pattern of broad retrograde amnesia with selective anterograde amnesia contrasts with recent data from monkeys with lesions which disrupt subcortical-cortical connectivity and which show the opposite pattern, namely no retrograde amnesia but severe anterograde amnesia. These results support the hypothesis that visual memory acquisition is supported by subcortical-cortical interactions while the retrieval of visual memories normally depends on the interaction between prefrontal cortex and inferior temporal cortex.

Spatial memory processes, assessed by spatial delayed response and spatial reversal learning, showed a weak trend in the opposite direction, though on these tasks neither lesion produced a serious loss. Comparison of the present results with those of earlier studies on the effects of various limbic system lesions suggests that object memory processes, including object recognition and object-reward association, are served by a circuit consisting mainly of the rhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus. Although both the rhinal and orbitofrontal components of this circuit appear to participate in both functions, evidence from the present and earlier studies suggests that the orbitofrontal component is the more important one for associative memory, i.e. the formation across trials of associations between particular objects or classes of objects and reward, whereas the rhinal component is the more critical one for recognition memory, i.e. the storage and retrieval within trials of the representations of particular objects.

Origin of CGRP-immunopositive axons was studied in the albino rat. Since beaded axons containing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are also present in the basal nucleus, the microstructural arrangement raises the question whether or not an interaction between CGRP and aAChR exists like in the neuromuscular junction. We found that electrolytic lesion of the parabrachial nucleus results in degeneration of CGRP-immunoreactive axons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis and induces shrinkage of principal cholinergic neurons while the contralateral nucleus basalis remains intact. Electrolytic lesions in the thalamus, caudate-putamen, and hippocampus did not induce alterations in Meynert's basal nucleus. Disappearance of CGRP after lesions of the parabrachial nucleus does not impair presynaptic nAChR in the basal nucleus, suggesting that, unlike in the neuromuscular junction, CGRP is not involved in the maintenance of nAChR in the basal forebrain. It is concluded that the parabrachial nucleus is involved in the activation of the nucleus basalis-prefrontal cortex system, essential in gnostic and mnemonic functions.

To assess the organization of pallidothalamic projections originating from motor and associative portions of GPi, small quantities of the anterograde/retrograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into localized regions of the caudal GPi in squirrel monkeys. The localization to motor and associative territories in GPi was confirmed by examining the corresponding regions of retrograde labeling in the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The labeled pallidothalamic fibers projected principally medially across the inferior edge of the internal capsule. The fiber bundle ventral to the caudal GPi was mainly devoid of labeling. Fibers labeled along the medial and inferior borders of GPi at centrorostral levels were traceable to the medial edge of the injections. The densest fiber labeling at rostral levels was produced by those injections with the greatest extent of rostral labeling of neurons. In opposition to generally accepted schemes, the findings from this study suggest that the pallidothalamic fibers originating from the caudal portions of GPi, including the motor territory, do not course ventromedially to form the ansa lenticularis, but rather, travel predominately medially through the lenticular fasciculus en route to the thalamus. Thus, proposed surgical schemes to target fibers ventral to the caudal GPi or at the rostral pole of GPi appear to be misguided. J. Comp. Neurol. 429:490-501, 2001.

More recent studies have expanded this view of attentional control. In this review, we will start from a traditional top-down account of attention control, and then discuss more recent findings on feature-based attention, thalamic influences, temporal network dynamics, and behavioral dynamics that collectively lead to substantial modifications.

Because of technical constraints, the precise effects of TMS on cortical circuits are difficult to assess experimentally. Here, this issue is investigated by constructing a detailed model of a portion of the thalamocortical system and examining the effects of the simulated delivery of a TMS pulse. The model, which incorporates a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints, includes 33,000 spiking neurons arranged in a 3-layered motor cortex and over 5 million intra- and interlayer synaptic connections. The model was validated by reproducing several results from the experimental literature. These include the frequency, timing, dose response, and pharmacological modulation of epidurally recorded responses to TMS (the so-called I-waves), as well as paired-pulse response curves consistent with data from several experimental studies. The modeled responses to simulated TMS pulses in different experimental paradigms provide a detailed, self-consistent account of the neural and synaptic activities evoked by TMS within prototypical cortical circuits.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Neurosci Training Program, Madison, WI 53719 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Tononi, G (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk Blvd, Madison, WI 53719 USA.","gtononi@wisc.edu","Tononi, Giulio/B-8387-2009","Hill, Sean/0000-0001-8055-860X","NIGMS NIH HHS [GM-07507] Funding Source: Medline","NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))",,,105,113,125,0,22,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Responsiveness of neurons in the distal forelimb region of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was examined in cat in association with the cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the corresponding region of the second somatosensory area (SII). The aim was to test whether a component of the stimulus-generated tactile input to SI came via an indirect, intracortical path from the thalamus through SIT, or whether, when SI responsiveness fell in association with STI inactivation, the effect could be explained by a disfacilitation of the SI neuron; that is, a removal of a tonic facilitatory influence on the SI neuron that arises from within SII. 2. The responses of 33 SI neurons to controlled tactile stimuli, usually l-s long trains of vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the skin of the distal forelimb, were examined quantitatively before, during, and after the rapid, reversible inactivation of the SII area. 3. Nineteen of the 33 neurons (similar to 60%) were unaffected in their response level by SII inactivation. These included neurons of several functional classes whose input came from different classes of tactile afferent fibers, including the Pacinian corpuscle (PC) associated fibers, other rapidly adapting (RA) afferents from glabrous skin, and presumed hair follicle afferent (HFA) fibers. The remaining 14 neurons (similar to 40%). which also included different functional classes, displayed a reduction in response level with SII inactivation. Because this was not accompanied by significant prolongation of the SI spike waveforms, it is not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SII to SI. Construction of stimulus-response relations demonstrated that any effect of SII inactivation on individual SI neurons was consistent over the whole response range. 4. The fall in responsiveness for some SI neurons in association with SII inactivation may be attributable to disfacilitation, that is, a loss of tonic facilitation arising in SII, rather than to a block of peripherally generated inputs that traverse an indirect path from the skin to SI, via SII. There are three reasons for suggesting this. First, in the course of SII cooling, the latency and time course of SI evoked potentials were not delayed in a way that might be expected if part of the SI response had come via SII. Second, the SII inactivation could reduce the SI spontaneous activity (as well as the stimulus-related responsiveness). The facilitation from Sn is therefore not necessarily dependent on overt tactile stimulation, and its source may therefore be endogenous to SII. 5. Third, phase locking in the responses of SI neurons activated by vibrotactile stimuli was unchanged with SII inactivation, whether the response level was reduced or unaffected. Had the tactile inputs to SI come via both a direct and an indirect path (through SII) from the thalamus, the inactivation of SII should have eliminated some temporal differences in the inputs to the SI neurons and should have resulted in a tightening of phase locking in the responses to vibration. However, this was not seen. 6. The results demonstrate that tactile inputs to SI are conveyed over a direct path from the thalamus and do not appear to be carried over an indirect serially organized path through SII. However, there is evidence that SII can exert a background facilitatory influence on SI responsiveness. The observations are qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar to earlier ones on the effects of SI on SII responsiveness in the cat, and they confirm that, in this species, SI and SIT constitute spatially separate cortical areas organized in parallel for the processing of incoming tactile information from the thalamus, but with each capable of modulatory influences on the responsiveness of the other area.","UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA","University of New South Wales Sydney",,,"Morley, John W/A-5311-2009","Morley, John/0000-0001-9246-853X",,,,,36,26,26,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

The deficits likely derive from neural injury, reflected as structural damage and impaired functional brain responses to ventilatory and autonomic challenges. Brain structures playing essential memory roles, including the hippocampus and anterior thalamus, are damaged in CCHS. Other memory formation circuitry, the fornix and mammillary bodies, have not been evaluated. We collected two high-resolution T1-weighted image series from 14 CCHS and 31 control subjects, using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Image series were averaged and reoriented to a standard template; areas containing the mammillary bodies and fornices were over sampled, and body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were calculated and compared between groups. Both left and right mammillary body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in CCHS over control subjects, controlling for age, gender, and intracranial volume. Damage to these structures may contribute to memory deficiencies found in CCHS. Hypoxic processes, together with diminished neuroprotection from micronutrient deficiencies secondary to fluid and dietary absorption issues, may contribute to the injury.

In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion.","[Carriot, Jerome; Brooks, Jessica X.; Cullen, Kathleen E.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","McGill University","Cullen, KE (corresponding author), McIntyre Med Res Bldg,Room 1219,3655 Prom Sir Wil, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.","kathleen.cullen@mcgill.ca",,,"CIHR; NIH; FRQNT","CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); FRQNT","This study was supported by CIHR, NIH, and FRQNT.

How the brain constructs these coherent firing patterns remains largely unknown. Several mechanisms of intracortical synchronization have been considered, in particular mutual inhibition and reciprocal excitation. These mechanisms fail to account for the zero-lag correlations observed among areas located at different levels in the visual hierarchy because the asymmetric laminar organization of ascending and descending connections in this hierarchy would predict systematic inter-areal phase lags. Here we show through detailed computer simulations that, when triplets rather than pairs of reciprocally connected areas in a cortical hierarchy are considered, zero-lag synchronization emerges naturally from their three-way interactions. These simulations were motivated by the observation that most areas in the cat and macaque monkey visual cortex are organized in such triplets. Our results suggest that patterns of anatomical connections in the mammalian neocortex provide a structural basis for the multi-level synchronization of neuronal activity.

At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.","[Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Dept Technol, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Thiele, Alexander] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; Newcastle University - UK","Deco, G (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Dept Technol, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.","gustavo.deco@upf.edu","DECO, GUSTAVO/A-6341-2008; 2010, BRAINGLOT Consolider Ingenio/D-1235-2009","DECO, GUSTAVO/0000-0002-8995-7583; Thiele, Alexander/0000-0003-4894-0213","BBSRC; Wellcome Trust; Spanish Research Project [SAF2010-16085]; CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 Programme [CSD2007-00012]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom; BBSRC [BB/F021399/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G0700976] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/F021399/1, BBS/B/09325] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700976] Funding Source: researchfish","BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Spanish Research Project(Spanish Government); CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 Programme(Spanish Government); ICREA(ICREA); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","AT was supported by the BBSRC and the Wellcome Trust.

In our study, we investigated first the potential neurotoxic effects of remifentanil on the developing brain and then the effects of remifentanil on isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the neonatal rat brain following exposure to a nociceptive stimulus. In the first experiment, postnatal day (P) 7 rats were randomly exposed to 30% oxygen, 1.5% isoflurane alone, 1.5% isoflurane and a plantar incision, normal saline, or remifentanil at a low (5 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), moderate (20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) or high (80 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) dose for 4 h. In the second 4-h experiment, P7 rats were randomly exposed to 1.5% isoflurane, infused with different doses of remifentanil (5, 10, and 20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), and subjected to a plantar incision. In both experiments, the number of apoptotic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus was assessed after two hours by cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL staining. Our data showed that unlike 1.5% isoflurane, remifentanil at any dose did not cause significant neuronal apoptosis in any brain section. In addition, in response to a nociceptive stimulus, the infusion of 10 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1) remifentanil reduced isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus (P = 0.003 in CA1, P = 0.002 in CA3) but not in the cortex or thalamus. Our findings suggest that remifentanil does not induce apoptosis and reduces isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the developing brain.","[Pan, Bo; Huang, Shaoqiang; Sun, Shen; Wang, Tingting] Fudan Univ, Obstet & Genecol Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Fudan University","Huang, SQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Obstet & Genecol Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","drhuangsq@163.com","Cline, Flo ra/AAL-4800-2020; fengmei, YE/AAL-5860-2020; wang, tingting/AAK-2640-2020; Huang, Shaoqiang/HIU-0454-2022","Huang, Shaoqiang/0000-0002-0515-8099","Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [15ZR1404600]","Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","Funded by the Municipal Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (15ZR1404600).

Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli. These differential patterns of activation suggest that the physiological states of hunger and satiety produce divergent activation in multiple brain areas in response to different pure gustatory stimuli.

The auditory cortical areas comprise a network of three interconnected regions (core, belt, and parabelt) that process inputs in serial and parallel. The belt and parabelt regions project to auditory-related areas of the temporal, posterior parietal, and prefrontal cortex. These areas tend to be sites of multisensory convergence, where modality-specific information related to the spatial or nonspatial characteristics of the sensory environment is integrated and subsequently used to guide goal-directed behavior. Neural imaging and advanced electrophysiological techniques are beginning to reveal the functional properties of these information streams and de. ne the roles of the various elements involved.

Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal. Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus, the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of experiencing negative emotions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This brings objects of interest into the fovea and keeps them there, but visual sensitivity has been shown to deteriorate while the eyes are moving. Here we show that human sensitivity for some visual stimuli is improved during smooth pursuit eye movements. Detection thresholds for briefly flashed, colored stimuli were 16% lower during pursuit than during fixation. Similarly, detection thresholds for luminance-defined stimuli of high spatial frequency were lowered. These findings suggest that the pursuit-induced sensitivity increase may have its neuronal origin in the parvocellular retino-thalamic system. This implies that the visual system not only uses feedback connections to improve processing for locations and objects being attended to, but that a whole processing subsystem can be boosted. During pursuit, facilitation of the parvocellular system may reduce motion blur for stationary objects and increase sensitivity to speed changes of the tracked object.","[Schuetz, Alexander C.; Braun, Doris I.; Gegenfurtner, Karl R.] Univ Giessen, Abt Allgemeine Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Kerzel, Dirk] Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Sci Educ, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland","Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Geneva","Gegenfurtner, KR (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Abt Allgemeine Psychol, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.","gegenfurtner@psychol.uni-giessen.de","Schütz, Alexander C/C-6855-2011","Schütz, Alexander C/0000-0002-7742-8123; Kerzel, Dirk/0000-0002-2466-5221; Gegenfurtner, Karl/0000-0001-5390-0684","German Research Foundation Forschergruppe Perception and Action''; German Research Foundation Graduiertenkolleg NeuroAct''","German Research Foundation Forschergruppe Perception and Action''(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation Graduiertenkolleg NeuroAct''(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank M.

Each strain was injected into the arm area of the primary motor cortex. One strain, HSV-1(McIntyre-B), was transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to project to the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., ventrolateral thalamus). In addition, second-order neurons were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate and interpositus) and in the globus pallidus (internal segment). This result supports the concept that the arm area of the primary motor cortex is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia output. In contrast, the other strain, HSV-1(H129), was transported transneuronally in the anterograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to receive input from the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., putamen, pontine nuclei). In addition, third-order neurons were labeled in the cerebellar cortex (granule and Golgi cells) and in the globus pallidus (largely the external segment). Our observations suggest that strain differences have an important impact on the direction of transneuronal transport of HSV-1.

Current evidence suggests that pathological brain connectivity could be a major contributor to the propagation of focal seizures, constituting a possible cause for some forms of intractable epilepsy. Currently, however, the precise network structures that underpin epileptic brain connectivity are poorly understood. In this study, we use a computational model to simulate focal seizure spread in the macaque cortical connectome. We then use the results to propose a novel network centrality measure (called Ictogenic Centrality) that accurately identifies which nodes are most effective in propagating seizures. In the framework presented, ictogenic centrality outperforms other standard centrality measures in correctly identifying ictogenic nodes, exhibiting high accuracy (0.947), specificity (0.939), and sensitivity (0.964). Ictogenic centrality is degree based and relies on only a single free parameter, making it useful and efficient to compute for large networks. Our results suggest that baseline brain connectivity may predispose the temporal and frontal lobes toward ictogenicity even in the absence of any overtly pathological network reorganization.","[Emerson, Joseph] Ohio Wesleyan Univ, 61 South Sandusky St, Delaware, OH 43015 USA; [Afelin, Amber] Wesleyan Univ, 45 Wyllys Ave, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Fink, Christian G.] Gonzaga Univ, 502 East Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258 USA","Ohio Wesleyan University; Wesleyan University; Gonzaga University","Fink, CG (corresponding author), Gonzaga Univ, 502 East Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258 USA.","jhemerso@owu.edu; aafelin@wesleyan.edu; vsliupas@gmail.com; finkt@gonzaga.edu",,"Fink, Christian/0000-0003-1214-8902",,,,,75,1,1,3,9,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0938-8974","1432-1467",,"J NONLINEAR SCI","J.

To evaluate potential sources of this visual input and how they enter into the circuitry of the auditory cortex, we examined axonal terminations in the primary auditory cortex from nonprimary extrastriate visual cortex (V2M, V2L) and from the multimodal thalamic suprageniculate nucleus (SG). Gross biocytin/biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injections into the SG or extrastriate cortex labeled inputs terminating primarily in superficial and deep layers. SG projects primarily to layers I, V, and VI while V2M and V2L project primarily to layers I and VI, with V2L also targeting layers Layer I inputs differ in that SG terminals are concentrated superficially, V2L are deeper, and V2M are equally distributed throughout. Individual axonal reconstructions document that single axons can 1) innervate multiple layers; 2) run considerable distances in layer I; and 3) run preferentially in the dorsoventral direction similar to isofrequency axes. At the electron microscopic level, SG and V2M terminals 1) are the same size regardless of layer; 2) are non-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic; 3) are smaller than ventral medial geniculate terminals synapsing in layer IV; 4) make asymmetric synapses onto dendrites/spines that 5) are non-GABAergic and 6) are slightly larger in layer I.

This paper proposes that these features of the visual system reflect, in part at least, its solution to a geometric problem inherent in binocular vision. Points in the visual quadrants are imaged on geometrically non-corresponding retinal points. Two such retinal loci, optically conjugate with a given visual point at one fixation distance or angle, will correspond to no single visual point at other fixation distances or angles. This raises potential problems for visual cortical neurons sensitive to a narrow range of binocular disparities. If these neurons are to function optimally at a variety of fixation distances and angles, their disparity tuning must be variable. It is suggested here that such dynamic disparity tuning is effected by the corticogeniculate projection acting on the segregated ocular representations in the geniculate laminae.",,,"MCILWAIN, JT (corresponding author), BROWN UNIV,DEPT NEUROSCI,BOX G-M2,PROVIDENCE,RI 02912, USA.",,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY02505] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,37,6,6,0,0,"ACADEMIC PRESS (LONDON) LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 7DX","0022-5193",,,"J THEOR BIOL","J.

The rmPFC was determined by its afferent projections from the medial half of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The rmPFC neurons were identified by their antidromic activation from the mediodorsal nucleus and/or by their firing characteristics. The rmPFC neurons increased their firing during the first conditioning sessions, but decreased it when conditioned responses (CRs) reached asymptotic values. Therefore, no significant relationships could be established between neuronal firing rates and the percentage of CRs or the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle during conditioning. Electrical train stimulation of the rmPFC produced a significant inhibition of air-puff-evoked blinks and reduced the generation of CRs compared with controls. Inhibition of the rmPFC by the local injection of lidocaine produced an increase in the amplitude of evoked reflex and conditioned eyeblinks and in the percentage of CRs. The rmPFC seems to be a potent inhibitor of reflex and conditioned eyeblinks, controlling the release of newly acquired eyelid responses until advanced stages of the acquisition process-i.e., until the need for the acquired response is fully confirmed. Therefore, the rmPFC seems to act as a flip-flop mechanism in controlling behavior.","[Leal-Campanario, Rocio; Delgado-Garcia, Jose M.; Gruart, Agnes] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Div Neurosci, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Universidad Pablo de Olavide","Gruart, A (corresponding author), Pablo de Olavide Univ, Div Neurosci, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, E-41013 Seville, Spain.","agrumas@upo.es","Delgado-Garcia, Jose M./V-1567-2019; Leal-Campanario, Rocio/K-6581-2014","Leal-Campanario, Rocio/0000-0002-5952-9334","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [BFU2011-29089, BFU2011-29286]; Junta de Andalucia [BIO122, CVI 2487, P07-CVI-02686]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity(Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia)","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity (Grants BFU2011-29089 and BFU2011-29286) and Junta de Andalucia (Grants BIO122, CVI 2487, and P07-CVI-02686) to A.

The mechanisms by which such a large-scale network could induce or modulate anxiety-like states are largely unknown. This article reviews our experimental program in macaques demonstrating a causal involvement of local striatal and frontal cortical sites in inducing pessimistic decision-making that underlies anxiety. Where relevant, we related these findings to the wider literature. To identify such sites, we have made a series of methodologic advances, including the combination of causal evidence for behavioral modification of pessimistic decisions with viral tracing methods. Critically, we introduced a version of the classic approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) conflict task, modified for use in non-human primates. We performed microstimulation of limbic-related cortical regions and the striatum, focusing on the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (cOFC), and the caudate nucleus (CN). Microstimulation of localized sites within these regions induced pessimistic decision-making by the monkeys, supporting the idea that the focal activation of these regions could induce an anxiety-like state, which subsequently influences decision-making. We further performed combined microstimulation and tract-tracing experiments by injecting anterograde viral tracers into focal regions, at which microstimulation induced increased avoidance. We found that effective stimulation sites in both pACC and cOFC zones projected preferentially to striosomes in the anterior striatum. Experiments in rodents have shown that the striosomes in the anterior striatum project directly to the dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and we have found evidence for a functional connection between striosomes and the lateral habenular region in which responses to reward are inhibitory. We present here further evidence for network interactions: we show that the pACC and cOFC project to common structures, including not only the anterior parts of the striosome compartment but also the tail of the CN, the subgenual ACC, the amygdala, and the thalamus. Together, our findings suggest that networks having pACC and cOFC as nodes share similar features in their connectivity patterns. We here hypothesize, based on these results, that the brain sites related to pessimistic judgment are mediated by a large-scale brain network that regulates dopaminergic functions and includes striosomes and striosome-projecting cortical regions.","[Amemori, Satoko; Amemori, Ken-ichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol, Kyoto, Japan; [Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Kyoto University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Amemori, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol, Kyoto, Japan.;Graybiel, AM (corresponding author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Graybiel, AM (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","graybiel@mit.edu; amemori.kenichi.7s@kyoto-u.ac.jp",,"Graybiel, Ann/0000-0002-4326-7720","NIH/NINDS [R01 NS025529]; NIH/NIMH [R01 MH060379, P50 MH119467]; Army Research Office [W911NF-16-1-0474]; Saks Kavanaugh Foundation; CHDI Foundation; ONR [N00014-07-1-090]; SCSB (Simons Foundation); McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Takeda Science Foundation; Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant; JSPS KAKENHI [JP21K07259, JP20H05469, JP20H05063, JP18K19497, JP20H03555]; AMED-SICORP [20349155]","NIH/NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NIH/NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Army Research Office; Saks Kavanaugh Foundation; CHDI Foundation; ONR(Office of Naval Research); SCSB (Simons Foundation); McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); AMED-SICORP","Original research summarized here was supported by NIH/NINDS grant R01 NS025529, NIH/NIMH grants R01 MH060379 and P50 MH119467, Army Research Office grant W911NF-16-1-0474, the Saks Kavanaugh Foundation, CHDI Foundation, ONR with Kramer (Office of Naval Research grant N00014-07-1-090), SCSB (grant from the Simons Foundation to the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT), and McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Data analyses and researches were supported by Takeda Science Foundation, Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant, AMED-SICORP 20349155, and JSPS KAKENHI Grant numbers JP21K07259, JP20H05469, JP20H05063, JP18K19497 and JP20H03555.",,107,3,3,2,8,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,"1662-453X",,"FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ","Front.

Objective: To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. Design: Open-label trial. Setting: Academic medical center. Patients: A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years). Intervention: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix. Main Outcome Measures: All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS. Results: Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striatal-thalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life. Conclusions: Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.

Current theories hypothesize that animals maintain a neural representation, or cognitive map, of external space in the brain. Whereas cells in the rat hippocampus and parahippocampal regions encode information about location, a second type of allocentric spatial cell encodes information about the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's on-going behaviors. These head direction (HD) cells are found in several areas of the classic Papez circuit. This review focuses on experimental studies conducted on HD cells and describes their discharge properties, functional significance, role in path integration, and responses to different environmental manipulations. The anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus appears critical for the generation of the directional signal. Both motor and vestibular cues also play important roles in the signal's processing. The neural network models proposed to account for HD cell firing are compared with known empirical findings. Examples from clinical cases of patients with topographical disorientation are also discussed. It is concluded that studying the neural mechanisms underlying the HD signal provides an excellent opportunity for understanding how the mammalian nervous system processes a high level cognitive signal.

Objective: This study investigated the changes in the spinal cord and ventral root after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Methods: Adult male cynonolgus monkeys (4-5 years, 5.5-7.5 kg) were subjected to MCAO (n = 6) or sham surgery (n = 4). After 12 weeks, spinal cords and the ventral roots were harvested. Morphometric alterations in the spinal cord were detected at C5 and L5 levels via immunofluorescence. The profiles of C5 and L5 ventral roots were displayed by toluidine blue staining and transmission electron microscopic examination. Results: Significant axonal loss in the contralateral corticospinal tract and abnormally enlarged axons in the ipsilateral were observed in monkeys with MCAO. The number of neurons in the contralateral ventral horn got declined while that in the ipsilateral was almost unaffected after MCAO compared with sham controls. Glial activation post-MCAO was observed in the bilateral corticospinal tract and the ventral horn. Aberrant nerve fibers appeared frequently in the contralateral ventral roots of MCAO monkey but rarely in the ipsilateral. Conclusions: These results indicate that focal cerebral infarction leads to pathological alterations in the spinal cord and ventral roots in non-human primates.","[Dang, Ge; Chen, Xinran; Zhao, Yuhui; Chen, Yicong; Ouyang, Fubing; Liang, Jiahui; Zeng, Jinsheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Neurol, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Ge; Chen, Xinran; Zhao, Yuhui; Chen, Yicong; Ouyang, Fubing; Liang, Jiahui; Zeng, Jinsheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Stroke Ctr, Natl Key Clin Dept, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Ge; Chen, Xinran; Zhao, Yuhui; Chen, Yicong; Ouyang, Fubing; Liang, Jiahui; Zeng, Jinsheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Discipline Neurol, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Ge; Guo, Yi] Jinan Univ, Dept Neurol, Clin Med Coll 2, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Jinan University","Zeng, JS (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Neurol, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zeng, JS (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Stroke Ctr, Natl Key Clin Dept, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zeng, JS (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Discipline Neurol, Affiliated Hosp 1, 58 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","zengjs@pub.guangzhou.gd.cn","dang, ge/HJQ-0105-2023",,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1307500]; Natural Science Foundation of China [81371277, 81571107]; Special Funds of Public Interest Research and Capacity Building of Guangdong Province [2014B020212003]; National Key Clinical Department, National Key Discipline; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of major neurological diseases [2014B030301035]; Southern China International Cooperation Base for Early Intervention and Functional Rehabilitation of Neurological Diseases [2015B050501003]; Project of Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission [201604020010]","National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Funds of Public Interest Research and Capacity Building of Guangdong Province; National Key Clinical Department, National Key Discipline; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of major neurological diseases; Southern China International Cooperation Base for Early Intervention and Functional Rehabilitation of Neurological Diseases; Project of Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission","This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant numbers 2017YFC1307500), the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81371277 and 81571107), the Special Funds of Public Interest Research and Capacity Building of Guangdong Province (grant number 2014B020212003), grants from the National Key Clinical Department, National Key Discipline, the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of major neurological diseases (grant number 2014B030301035), the Southern China International Cooperation Base for Early Intervention and Functional Rehabilitation of Neurological Diseases (grant number 2015B050501003), and the Project of Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission (grant number 201604020010).",,46,5,6,1,12,"IOS PRESS","AMSTERDAM","NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0922-6028","1878-3627",,"RESTOR NEUROL NEUROS","Restor.

Methods: Singular value decomposition was used to produce 20 SPECT factors (known as vectors) (n = 152). Vector scores were then computed for four groups (n = 136), differing in cognitive status: Group 1-normal controls at both baseline and follow-up; Group 2-subjects with questionable AD at both baseline and follow-up; Group 3-subjects with questionable AD at baseline who converted to AD on follow-up (Converters); Group 4-subjects with AD at baseline. All SPECT data in the analyses were gathered at baseline. Results: The four groups could be distinguished on the basis of their baseline SPECT data (p less than or equal to 0.00005; hit rate = 83%), Regional decreases in perfusion were most prominent among Converters in the hippocampalamygdaloid complex, the posterior cingulate, the anterior thalamus, and the anterior cingulate. Inclusion of apolipoprotein E status did not significantly improve the discrimination. Conclusions: SPECT data gathered and analyzed in this manner may be useful as one aspect of the preclinical prediction of AD. Three of the four brain regions important for discriminating Converters from normal controls involve a distributed brain network pertaining to memory, suggesting that this network may be selectively affected in the earliest stages of AD.","Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; McLean Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Belmont, MA 02178 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; Brandeis Univ, Florence Heller Sch Adv Studies Social Welf, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; MIT, Clin Res Ctr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; McLean Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brandeis University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Johnson, KA (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Radiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",,"Becker, John Alex/AAI-4060-2021","Becker, John Alex/0000-0001-7435-1338",,,,,60,3,3,0,0,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0028-3878","1526-632X",,"NEUROLOGY","Neurology","JUN",1998,50,6,,,,,1563,1571,,"10.1212/WNL.50.6.1563","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.50.6.1563"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.50.6.1563"")",,,9,"Clinical Neurology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","ZU712",,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000074226700010","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000074226700010"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In fMRI experiment 1, a linear relationship between familiarity with lyrics and activation was found in left-hemispheric speech-related as well as bilateral striatal areas which is in line with previous research on generation of lyrics. In fMRI experiment 2, we employed so called Mondegreens and Soramimi to induce misperceptions of lyrics revealing a bilateral network including middle temporal and inferior frontal areas as well as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal thalamus. ACC activation also correlated with the extent to which misperceptions were judged as amusing corroborating previous neuroimaging results on the role of this area in mediating the pleasant experience of chills during music perception. Finally, we examined the areas engaged during misperception of lyrics using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to determine their structural connectivity. These combined fMRI/DWI results could serve as a neurobiological model for future studies on other types of misunderstanding which are events with potentially strong impact on our social life.

Perception of fearful facial expressions has been extensively studied, appearing to depend upon the amygdala(2-6). Disgust-literally 'bad taste'-is another important emotion, with a distinct evolutionary history(7), and is conveyed by a characteristic facial expression(8-10). We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the neural substrate for perceiving disgust expressions. Normal volunteers were presented with faces showing mild or strong disgust or fear. Cerebral activation in response to these stimuli was contrasted with that for neutral faces. Results for fear generally confirmed previous positron emission tomography findings of amygdala involvement. Both strong and mild expressions of disgust activated anterior insular cortex but not the amygdala; strong disgust also activated structures linked to a limbic cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit. The anterior insula is known to be involved in responses to offensive tastes. The neural response to facial expressions of disgust in others is thus closely related to appraisal of distasteful stimuli.","MRC, APPL PSYCHOL UNIT, CAMBRIDGE CB2 2EF, ENGLAND; INST PSYCHIAT, NEUROIMAGING UNIT, LONDON SE5 8AF, ENGLAND; INST PSYCHIAT, BRAIN IMAGE ANAL UNIT, LONDON SE5 8AF, ENGLAND; INST PSYCHIAT, DEPT PSYCHOL, LONDON SE5 8AF, ENGLAND; UNIV ST ANDREWS, SCH PSYCHOL, ST ANDREWS KY16 9JU, FIFE, SCOTLAND","University of Cambridge; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of St Andrews","Phillips, ML (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON KINGS COLL, SCH MED & DENT, DEPT PSYCHOL MED, 103 DENMARK HILL, LONDON SE5 8AZ, ENGLAND.",,"anand, amit/A-7222-2009; Young, Andy/G-2189-2011; David, Anthony S/C-1315-2011; Williams, Steve C/D-6979-2011; David, Anthony/O-1750-2019; Brammer, Michael J/B-7128-2012; Bullmore, Ed/C-1706-2012; Perrett, David/AAA-6264-2020","Young, Andy/0000-0002-1202-6297; David, Anthony S/0000-0003-0967-774X; Williams, Steve C/0000-0003-4299-1941; David, Anthony/0000-0003-0967-774X; Brammer, Michael J/0000-0001-9800-2052; Bullmore, Ed/0000-0002-8955-8283; Perrett, David/0000-0002-6025-0939; opoku, anita/0000-0001-7243-8157","Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,30,1176,1195,2,142,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","0028-0836","1476-4687",,"NATURE","Nature","OCT 2",1997,389,6650,,,,,495,498,,"10.1038/39051","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/39051"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/39051"")",,,4,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","XY909",9333238,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1997XY90900056","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1997XY90900056"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

While it is known that primates have a complex array of 10 or more somatosensory areas that contribute to the analysis of sensory information from the hand, less is known about what cortical areas are involved in processing information from receptors of the tongue and teeth. The tongue contains taste receptors, as well as mechanoreceptors. Afferents from taste receptors and mechanoreceptors of the tongue access different ascending systems in the brainstem. However, it is uncertain how these two sources of information are processed in cortex. Here the parts of somatosensory areas 3b, 3a, and presumptive 1 that represent the mechanoreceptors of the teeth and tongue are identified, and evidence is presented that the representations of the tongue also get information from the taste nucleus of the thalamus, VPMpc. As areas 3b, 3a, and 1 project to other areas of somatosensory cortex, and those areas to additional areas, some or all of the currently defined somatosensory areas of cortex may be involved in processing gustatory, as well as tactile, information from the tongue and thus have a role in the biologically important function of evaluating food in the mouth.

However, during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when cortical activity is dominated by acetylcholine, the ACC is activated but DLPFC is suppressed. Using pathway tracing and electron microscopy in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta), we tested the hypothesis that the opposite states may reflect specific modulation by acetylcholine through strategic synaptic localization of muscarinic m2 receptors, which inhibit neurotransmitter release presynaptically, but are thought to be excitatory postsynaptically. In the ACC pathway to DLPFC (area 32 to area 9), m2 receptors predominated in ACC axon terminals and in more than half of the targeted dendrites of presumed inhibitory neurons, suggesting inhibitory cholinergic influence. In contrast, in a pathway linking the DLPFC area 46 to DLPFC area 9, postsynaptic m2 receptors predominated in targeted spines of presumed excitatory neurons, consistent with their mutual activation in working memory. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic and postsynaptic specificity of m2 cholinergic receptors may help explain the differential engagement of ACC and DLPFC areas in REM sleep for memory consolidation and synergism in awake states for cognitive control.","[Medalla, Maria; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Medalla, Maria; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Medalla, Maria; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu",,"Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832; Medalla, Maria/0000-0003-4890-2532","National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01NS024760]; National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health [RO1MH057414]; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science, and Technology (a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center) [SBE-0354378]","National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science, and Technology (a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke R01NS024760 and the National Institute of Mental Health RO1MH057414 and by Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science, and Technology (a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center) Grant SBE-0354378.

At the global brain level, the human MTL has been described as part of the default mode network and amygdala nuclei as parts of the salience network, with both networks collectively forming a large-scale brain system supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. We hypothesized (i) that intrinsic functional connectivity of slow activity fluctuations would reveal human MTL subsystems locally extending to the amygdala; and (ii) that these extended local subsystems would be globally embedded in large-scale brain systems supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. Capitalizing on resting-state fMRI data of three independent samples of cognitively healthy adults (one main and two replication samples: N = 101, 60, and 29, respectively), we analyzed the functional connectivity of fluctuating ongoing BOLD-activity within and outside the amygdala-MTL in a data-driven way using masked independent component and dual-regression analyses. We found that at the local level, MTL subsystems extend to the amygdala and are functionally organized along the longitudinal amygdala-MTL axis. These subsystems are characterized by consistent involvement of amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, but variable participation of perirhinal and parahippocampal regions. At the global level, amygdala-MTL subsystems selectively connect to salience, thalamic-brainstem, and default mode networks - the major cortical and subcortical components of the allostatic-interoceptive system. These findings provide evidence for integrated amygdala-MTL subsystems in humans, which are embedded within a larger allostatic-interoceptive system.","[Ruiz-Rizzo, Adriana L.; Finke, Kathrin; Mueller, Hermann J.] Ludwig Maximilans Univ Munchen, Dept Gen & Expt Psychol, Leopoldstr 13, D-80802 Munich, Germany; [Beissner, Florian] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Neuroradiol, Somatosensory & Auton Therapy Res, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Finke, Kathrin] Univ Klinikum Jena, Hans Berger Klin Neurol, Klinikum 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany; [Zimmer, Claus; Sorg, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Neuroradiol, Ismaningerstr 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Pasquini, Lorenzo] Univ Calif San Francisco, Memory & Aging Ctr, Dept Neurol, 675 Nelson Rising Lane, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Sorg, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Neuroimaging Ctr, Ismaningerstr 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Sorg, Christian] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Munich, Germany","University of Munich; Hannover Medical School; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Technical University of Munich; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich","Ruiz-Rizzo, AL (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilans Univ Munchen, Dept Gen & Expt Psychol, Leopoldstr 13, D-80802 Munich, Germany.","adriana.ruiz@lmu.de","Beissner, Florian/I-3474-2019; Ruiz-Rizzo, Adriana L./S-4203-2018","Beissner, Florian/0000-0003-0513-7551; Ruiz-Rizzo, Adriana L./0000-0003-1467-0745; Pasquini, Lorenzo/0000-0002-7899-7061","European Union FP7 Marie Curie ITN Grant [606901]; German Academic Foundation","European Union FP7 Marie Curie ITN Grant(Marie Curie Actions); German Academic Foundation","This work was supported by the European Union FP7 Marie Curie ITN Grant 606901 (INDIREA) and the German Academic Foundation.

The anterior insula has connections to the primary and supplementary motor cortices, the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus, and to the nucleus tractus solitarius, all of which are important regions in the mediation of oropharyngeal swallowing, Therefore, discrete lesions of the anterior insula may disrupt these connections and, thereby, produce dysphagia.","VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,AUDIOL SPEECH PATHOL SERV,NEW ORLEANS,LA; VET AFFAIRS MED CTR,NEUROL SERV,NEW ORLEANS,LA; TULANE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHIAT & NEUROL,NEW ORLEANS,LA 70112","US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Tulane University",,,,,,,,,61,138,141,1,5,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0179-051X",,,"DYSPHAGIA","Dysphagia","SUM",1997,12,3,,,,,146,156,,"10.1007/PL00009529","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00009529"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00009529"")",,,11,"Otorhinolaryngology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Otorhinolaryngology","XB367",9190100,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1997XB36700006","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1997XB36700006"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recordings of the activity of neurons in different parts of the striatum of primates show that they have the following properties: 1) neurons in much of the putamen, which receives inputs from the sensori-motor cortex, have activity related to movements; 2) neurons in the caudate nucleus, which receives from the association cortex, have activity related for example to environmental stimuli which signal preparation for or initiation of behavioral responses; 3) neurons in the tail of the caudate nucleus, which receives strongly from the inferior temporal visual cortex, respond when a patterned visual stimulus changes; 4) some neurons in the posterior ventral putamen, which receives from the inferior temporal visual cortex and the prefrontal cortex, respond in a visual short term memory task, delayed match to sample. The neurons responded in the delay period, or differentially to match and non-match stimuli. These neurons did not respond in an auditory delayed match to sample task, so that their activity was not related to movement per se, but was instead more closely related to visual inputs relevant to a memory task; 5) some neurons in the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens), which receives from limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus, respond to stimuli associated with reinforcement or to novel stimuli. It is concluded that there is considerable segregation of function within the striatum. It is suggested that there is an opportunity for inputs which originate from different parts of the cerebral cortex to interact, via a first stage of convergence in the striatum, and by a further stage of convergence on the dendrites of single neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; and that both these parts of the basal ganglia may learn associations between the different signals they receive. The result of this convergence and learning is that the basal ganglia provide a way for cortical areas far on in the hierarchy of information processing to become linked during motor learning to particular sequences of movements, and thus to be involved in the execution of motor programs.",,,"ROLLS, ET (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, S PARKS RD, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND.",,,"Rolls, Edmund/0000-0003-3025-1292",,,,,80,145,147,0,16,"MASSON EDITEUR","MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9","21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE","0035-3787","2213-0004",,"REV NEUROL-FRANCE","Rev.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and H-2 O-15 in nine normal volunteers while performing one control and two reaching tasks. In all tasks, visual stimuli were presented on a head mounted display (HMD). A target board was placed in front of the subjects bearing six red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) aligned on a circle with a green LED at its center. The center green LED and one of the six red LEDs, randomly selected, were repeatedly switched on and off, alternatively. In the control task, subjects were instructed to gaze at the lit LED. In the two reaching tasks, the reaching with visual feedback (RwithF) task and the reaching without visual feedback (RwithoutF) task, they had to point to the lit red LED with their right index fingers. In the RwithF task, their right hands were visible on the HMD before touching the target, whereas in the RwithoutF task, they were not visible. For each subject, subtraction images of each reaching task minus the control and the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task were calculated after transformation of PET images into the standard brain shape with an adjustable computerized brain atlas. These subtraction rCBF images were then averaged among the subjects, and significant changes of rCBF were identified. Significant increases in rCBF not only in the RwithF task minus control image but also in the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task image were observed in the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus of the right hemisphere, and the right cerebellum and vermis. These results indicate that the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere and the cerebellum are involved in integrating visual feedback of hand movements and execution of accurate pointing.","Tohoku Univ, Dept Nucl Med & Radiol, IDAC, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Ctr Cyclotron & Radioisotope, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan","Tohoku University; Tohoku University","Inoue, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Dept Nucl Med & Radiol, IDAC, Aoba Ku, 4-1 Seiryocho, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan.",,,,,,,,68,65,66,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information. It favors an early stage of cortical processing, which is modified by the connections between multimodal and auditory neurons from thalamus to primary somatosensory area.","Univ Toronto, Rotman Res Inst, Baycrest Ctr Geriatr Care, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada; Munster Univ Hosp, Inst Expt Audiol, Munster, Germany","University of Toronto; Baycrest; University of Munster","Pantev, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Rotman Res Inst, Baycrest Ctr Geriatr Care, 3560 Bathurst St, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada.",,,"Ross, Bernhard/0000-0001-7290-631X",,,,,31,54,55,0,3,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0959-4965","1473-558X",,"NEUROREPORT","Neuroreport","JAN 20",2003,14,1,,,,,157,161,,"10.1097/00001756-200301200-00029","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001756-200301200-00029"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001756-200301200-00029"")",,,5,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","640FP",12544849,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000180677900029","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000180677900029"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Intellectual deficits are also seen in PD, but the pathophysiology of these difficulties is poorly understood. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in neurologically intact subjects during the performance of attention-demanding, sentence processing tasks using positron emission tomography (PET). The results demonstrated significantly increased rCBF in a distributed set of cerebral regions during the detection of an adjective or a particular agent in a sentence, including anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior and middle frontal cortex, left inferior temporo-occipital cortex, posterolateral temporal cortex, left caudate, and left thalamus. We identified defects in this cerebral network by studying PD patients with two PET techniques. Resting PET studies revealed a significant correlation between regional cerebral glucose metabolism in anterior cingulate cortex and deficits in attending to subtle grammatical aspects of sentences. Studies of PO patients with the PET activation technique revealed little change in anterior cingulate and left frontal CBF during performance of the adjective detection or agent detection tasks. These data suggest that a defect in anterior cingulate cortex contributes to the cognitive impairments observed in PD.","UNIV PENN, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104 USA; GRAD HOSP PHILADELPHIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19146 USA","University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine",,,,,"NIA NIH HHS [AG09399] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCD NIH HHS [DC00039] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS14867] Funding Source: Medline","NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,78,64,65,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) have recently demonstrated a number of cerebral and brain stem loci responding to cutaneous noxious stimuli. However, intersubject variability, both in the frequency and increased or decreased intensity of the responses, has caused uncertainty as to their significance. Nevertheless, the large number of available imaging studies have shown that;many areas with recognized functions are frequently affected by painful stimuli. With this evidence and recent developments in tracing central nervous system connections between areas responding to noxious stimuli, it is possible to identify nociceptive pathways that are within, or contribute to, afferent spinothalamo-cortical sensory and efferent skeletomotor and autonomic motor systems. In this study it is proposed that cortical and nuclear mechanisms for pain perception and response are hierarchically arranged with the prefrontal cortex at its highest level. Nevertheless, all components make particular contributions without which certain nociceptive failures can occur, as in pathological pain arising in some cases of nervous system injury.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Clin Neurol Sci, London, ON, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Hudson, AJ (corresponding author), Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Clin Neurol Sci, 339 Windermere Rd, London, ON N6A 5A5, Canada.",,,,,,,,170,46,49,0,7,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0317-1671","2057-0155",,"CAN J NEUROL SCI","Can.

J. Neurophysiol. 83: 1019-1030, 2000. A fundamental feature of neural circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is the existence of recurrent excitatory connections between spiny neurons, recurrent inhibitory connections between smooth neurons, and local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modeled the dynamic behavior of intermixed excitatory and inhibitory populations of cells in V1 that receive input from the classical receptive field (the receptive field center) through feedforward thalamocortical afferents, as well as input from outside the classical:receptive field (the receptive field surround) via long-range intracortical connections. A counterintuitive result is that the response of oriented cells can be facilitated beyond optimal levels when the surround stimulus is cross-oriented with respect to the center and suppressed when the surround stimulus is iso-oriented. This effect is primarily due to changes in recurrent inhibition within a local circuit. Cross-oriented surround stimulation leads to a reduction of presynaptic inhibition and a supraoptimal response, whereas iso-oriented surround stimulation has the opposite effect. This mechanism is used to explain the orientation and contrast dependence of contextual interactions in primary visual cortex: responses to a center stimulus can be both strongly suppressed and supraoptimally facilitated as a function of surround orientation, and these effects diminish as stimulus contrast decreases.","MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Dragoi, V (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 45 Carleton St,E25-235, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY-07023] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,59,76,78,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Our goal was to determine if any brain regions are differentially activated by the attentional demands of these two search modes. We used fMRI to examine activation patterns during search for a target among a radial array of several distractors that were manipulated to produce efficient or inefficient search. Distractors for inefficient search were either uniform or varied to manipulate difficulty due to perceptual priming. No brain regions were uniquely activated by efficient or inefficient search, although inefficient search generally produced greater activations. The main differences were found in clusters in the superior occipital and superior parietal regions, for which activations were substantially greater for inefficient search. Similar results were found for frontal regions, such as the inferior prefrontal, superior frontal, anterior insula, and supplementary eye field, as well as the right ventral lateral thalamus. For inefficient search, increasing task difficulty resulted in low accuracy, but no difference in RT or activations. A working memory task utilizing the same display and response mode, but not involving search, activated the same frontal-parietal network as inefficient search (more so for the more difficult inefficient condition). Thus, our results identify brain regions that are more heavily recruited under conditions of inefficient search, independent of task difficultly per se, probably due in part to attentional modulation involving demands of eye movements, working memory, and top-down controls, but do not reveal independent networks related to efficient and inefficient search.

Traumatic brain injury triggers chronic microglial activation, but it is unclear whether this is harmful or beneficial. A successful chronic-phase treatment for traumatic brain injury might be to target microglia. In experimental models, the antibiotic minocycline inhibits microglial activation. We investigated the effect of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration using PET, MRI, and measurement of the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma. Microglial activation was assessed using C-11-PBR28 PET. The relationships of microglial activation to measures of brain injury, and the effects of minocycline on disease progression, were assessed using structural and diffusion MRI, plasma neurofilament light, and cognitive assessment. Fifteen patients at least 6 months after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury received either minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily or no drug, for 12 weeks. At baseline, C-11-PBR28 binding in patients was increased compared to controls in cerebral white matter and thalamus, and plasma neurofilament light levels were elevated. MRI measures of white matter damage were highest in areas of greater C-11-PBR28 binding. Minocycline reduced 11 C-PBR28 binding (mean Delta white matter binding = -23.30%, 95% confidence interval -40.9 to -5.64%, P = 0.018), but increased plasma neurofilament light levels. Faster rates of brain atrophy were found in patients with higher baseline neurofilament light levels. In this experimental medicine study, minocycline after traumatic brain injury reduced chronic microglial activation while increasing a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that microglial activation has a reparative effect in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury.","[Scott, Gregory; Jolly, Amy; Cole, James H.; De Simoni, Sara; Jenkins, Peter O.; Feeney, Claire; Owen, David R.; Lingford-Hughes, Anne; Howes, Oliver; Goldstone, Anthony P.; Matthews, Paul M.; Sharp, David J.] Imperial Coll London, Div Brain Sci, Dept Med, London, England; [Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Neurosci & Physiol, Dept Psychiat & Neurochem, Molndal, Sweden; [Zetterberg, Henrik; Blennow, Kaj] Sahlgrens Univ Hosp, Clin Neurochem Lab, Molndal, Sweden; [Zetterberg, Henrik] UCL Inst Neurol, Dept Mol Neurosci, London, England; [Patel, Maneesh C.] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Gunn, Roger N.] Imanova Ltd, London, England","Imperial College London; University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; University of London; University College London; Imperial College London","Sharp, DJ (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Hammersmith Hosp, Computat Cognit & Clin Neuroimaging Lab, 3rd Floor,Burlington Danes Bldg,Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, England.","david.sharp@imperial.ac.uk","Cole, James H/I-5197-2019; Howes, Oliver/E-7156-2010; Sharp, David J/A-2119-2013; Gunn, Roger/H-1666-2012","Cole, James H/0000-0003-1908-5588; Howes, Oliver/0000-0002-2928-1972; Gunn, Roger/0000-0003-1181-5769; Jolly, Amy/0000-0002-7413-9772; Scott, Gregory/0000-0001-8063-5871","Wellcome Trust-GlaxoSmithKline Translational Medicine Training Programme; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); MS Society of Great Britain; Progressive MS Alliance; Medical Research Council (MRC); GlaxoSmithKline; Imperial College Healthcare Trust Biomedical Research Centre; Swedish Research Council; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; VINNOVA; Torsten Soderberg foundation; NIHR; MRC [MC_U120097115, MR/N008219/1, MR/L022141/1, MR/N026063/1, G0700995, G0900897, MR/N026934/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0700995, 1116129, MC_U120097115, MR/L022141/1, MR/N026934/1, MR/N008219/1, G0900897, MR/K501013/1, MR/N026063/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NIHR-RP-011-048, NF-SI-0514-10022] Funding Source: researchfish","Wellcome Trust-GlaxoSmithKline Translational Medicine Training Programme; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MS Society of Great Britain; Progressive MS Alliance; Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Imperial College Healthcare Trust Biomedical Research Centre; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); VINNOVA(Vinnova); Torsten Soderberg foundation; NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","G.S. was supported by a clinical research fellowship awarded in the Wellcome Trust-GlaxoSmithKline Translational Medicine Training Programme.

Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with several BV isolates. Comparisons were based upon the doses required to produce infection (ID50), non-central nervous system (CNS) clinical disease (CS50), CNS disease (CNSD50) and lethal effect (LD50). Strains differed in respect of the dose required to produce clinical disease in BALB/c mice. C57BL/6 mice were more resistant than BALB/c mice to CNS disease. Skin lesions at the inoculation site consisted of epidermal necrosis, ulceration, serocellular crusts and underlying dermatitis. CNS lesions included marked inflammation in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion and lumbar spinal cord (point. of viral entry). The distribution of the lumbar spinal cord lesions suggested viral entry via sensory afferent neurons, ventral motor tracts, or both. The lesions in the more cranial spinal cord segments suggested ascension to the brain via bilateral spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. Brain lesions included encephalitis with neuronal necrosis and white matter destruction located consistently at the base of the brainstem, the reticular system, and rostrally to the thalamus and hypothalamus. Viral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the lesions. The results indicated an ascending encephalomyelitis syndrome similar to that produced by BV in mail. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, taste is organized along a neural dimension of nutrients versus toxins, which corresponds to a behavioral dimension of acceptance versus rejection, and to a hedonic dimension of appetitive versus aversive qualities. Reflexive responses; cognitive analyses, and hedonic reactions appear to be managed at different levels of the nervous system. At the first central relay, the nucleus of the solitary tract, somatic reflexes for acceptance or rejection, and autonomic reflexes anticipating digestion are orchestrated. At the second, the parabrachial nucleus of the rodent, associative mechanisms important to the development of conditioned aversions and sodium appetite are manifested. In the thalamic taste relay, gustatory memories associated with non-visceral events may be formed. Primary taste cortex appears to be the site for a cognitive evaluation of gustatory quality and intensity. Finally, a hedonic assessment of the chemical may be made in secondary taste cortex and in the ventral forebrain sites to which it projects. With this assessment comes integration of the gustatory signal with those from other senses, perhaps to create a perception of flavor. Therefore, a sequence that begins with an analysis of the molecular structure of a chemical in the mouth serves to incorporate that gustatory component into an appreciation of flavor, and to participate in the control of motivational processes that guide dietary selection.

Although many of these brain areas are highly interconnected and are engaged in multiple processing roles, each area has been typically considered in isolation. Accordingly, little attention has been given to the global functional organization of brain mechanisms mediating pain processing. In the present investigation, we have combined positron emission tomography with psychophysical assessment of graded painful stimuli to better characterize the multiregional organization of supraspinal pain processing mechanisms and to identify a brain mechanism subserving the processing of pain intensity. Multiple regression analysis revealed statistically reliable relationships between perceived pain intensity and activation of a functionally diverse group of brain regions, including those important in sensation, motor control, affect, and attention. Pain intensity-related activation occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum, putamen, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex, contralaterally in the primary somatosensory cortex and supplementary motor area, and ipsilaterally in the ventral premotor area. These results confirm the existence of a highly distributed, bilateral supraspinal mechanism engaged in the processing of pain intensity. The conservation of pain intensity information across multiple, functionally distinct brain areas contrasts sharply with traditional views that sensory-discriminative processing of pain is confined within the somatosensory cortex and can account for the preservation of conscious awareness of pain intensity after extensive cerebral cortical lesions.","NIDR, Pain & Neurosensory Mechanisms Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Lab Brain & Cognit, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)","Coghill, RC (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",,,,,,,,59,780,796,0,45,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","Rockville","6120 Executive Blvd, Suite 600, Rockville, MD, UNITED STATES","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

The primate PPC shows functional differentiation such that dorsal areas are implicated in top-down, controlled attention, and ventral areas are implicated in bottom-up, stimulus-driven attention. Whether the rat PPC also shows such functional differentiation is unknown. Here, we address this open question using functional neuroanatomy and in vivo electrophysiology. Using conventional tract-tracing methods, we examined connectivity with other structures implicated in visuospatial attention including the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LPn) and the postrhinal cortex (POR). We showed that the LPn projects to the entire PPC, preferentially targeting more ventral areas. All parts of the PPC and POR are reciprocally connected with the strongest connections evident between ventral PPC and caudal POR. Next, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in dorsal and ventral PPC as rats performed a visuospatial attention (VSA ) task that engages in both bottom-up and top-down attention. Previously, we provided evidence that the dorsal PPC is engaged in multiple cognitive process including controlled attention (). Here, we further showed that ventral PPC cells respond to stimulus onset more rapidly than dorsal PPC cells, providing evidence for a role in stimulus-driven, bottom-up attention.","[Yang, Fang-Chi; Dokovna, Lisa B.; Burwell, Rebecca D.] Brown Univ, Cognit Linguist Psychol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Burwell, Rebecca D.] Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Brown University; Brown University","Burwell, RD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Cognit Linguist Psychol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Burwell, RD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.","rebecca_burwell@brown.edu","Burwell, Rebecca D/E-4970-2011",,"National Institute of Mental Health [R01-MH108729]; National Science Foundation [IOB-0522220, IOB-1146334]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [N6600110-C-2010]","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA))","National Institute of Mental Health (R01-MH108729), the National Science Foundation (IOB-0522220 and IOB-1146334), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (N6600110-C-2010).",,69,3,3,0,8,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

In order to translate basic scientific results from rodents to the human setting a large animal model is needed to thoroughly study the effect of such therapeutic interventions. The aim of the study was, accordingly, to describe the basic anatomy of the Gottingen minipig NAcc and its retrograde connections. Tracing was carried out by MRI-guided stereotactic unilateral fluorogold injections in the NAcc of Gottingen minipigs. After 2 weeks the brains were sectioned and subsequently stained with Nissl-, autometallographic (AMG) development of myelin, and DARPP-32 and calbindin immunohistochemistry. The minipig NAcc was divided in a central core and an outer medial, ventral and lateral shell. We confirmed the NAcc to be a large and well-segregated structure toward its medial, ventral and lateral borders. The fluorogold tracing revealed inputs to NAcc from the medial parts of the prefrontal cortex, BA 25 (subgenual cortex), insula bilaterally, amygdala, the CA1-region of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, paraventricular and anterior parts of thalamus, dorsomedial parts of hypothalamus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), the retrorubral field and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei.

Methods-Forty-one patients participating in an inpatient stroke rehabilitation database, admitted 17+/-2 (SEM) days after initial unilateral hemispheric ischemic stroke, with neuroimaging studies performed >48 hours after stroke and with minimal upper limb (UL) movement (admission Fugl-Meyer UL motor scores less than or equal to9; normal score, 58) were studied. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their UL discharge Fugl-Meyer score: 0 to 9, no/poor recovery; 10 to 18, well-defined flexion-extension synergies; and >18, synergies + isolated movements. Lesions affecting the following structures were recorded: primary motor cortex, premotor area, supplementary motor area, anterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (secondary motor efferents), posterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (primary motor efferents), genu, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule (PLIC), basal ganglia, and thalamus. chi (2) Analysis and ANOVA were used to study the significance of stroke location on UL motor recovery. Results-The effect of involvement of primary, premotor, or supplementary motor areas on motor recovery did not reach statistical significance. Patients with purely cortical stroke were likely to recover UL isolated movement (3 of 4) compared with purely subcortical (1 of 17) or mixed cortical-subcortical stroke location (2 of 20) (P=0.009). Of those with cortical, subcortical, or mixed cortical plus subcortical lesions sparing the PLIC, 5 of 13 recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Only 1 of 28 patients with involvement of the PLIC plus adjacent corona radiata, basal ganglia, or thalamus recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Patients with small lacunar strokes affecting only the PLIC did not have sufficient motor deficits 2 weeks after stroke to meet inclusion criteria. Conclusions-The probability of recovery of isolated UL movement decreases progressively with lesion location as follows: cortex, corona radiata, and PLIC. This is consistent with our current understanding of redundant cortical motor representation and convergence of corticofugal motor efferents as they pass through the corona radiata to the PLIC.","Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurol, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; Cornell Univ, Burke Rehabil Hosp, Weill Med Coll, White Plains, NY USA","University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine","Shelton, FDAP (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurol, 711 Stanton L Young Blvd,Suite 209, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA.",,,,,,,,46,237,253,2,13,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA","0039-2499",,,"STROKE","Stroke","JAN",2001,32,1,,,,,107,112,,"10.1161/01.STR.32.1.107","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.STR.32.1.107"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.STR.32.1.107"")",,,6,"Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology","389JF",11136923,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000166234300022","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000166234300022"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

To explore this issue, I measured, during conditions of spatial or feature-based attention, activity in the human subcortical visual nuclei, which have precise retinotopic maps and are known to play important roles in the regulation of spatial attention but have limited selectivity of nonspatial features. Subjects attended to and detected changes in separate fields of moving or colored dots. When the fields were disjoint, spatially attending to one field enhanced hemodynamic responses in the superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and two retinotopic pulvinar nuclei. When the two dot fields were spatially overlapping, feature-based attention to the moving versus colored dots enhanced responses in the pulvinar nuclei and the majority of the LGN, including the magnocellular layers, and suppressed activity in some areas within the parvocellular layers; the SC was inconsistently modulated among subjects. The results demonstrate that feature-based attention operates throughout the visual system by prioritizing neurons encoding the attended information, including broadly tuned thalamic neurons. I conclude that spatial and feature-based attention operate via a common principle, but that spatial location is a special feature in that it is widely encoded in the brain, is used for overt orienting, and uses a specialized structure, the SC.","[Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Rochester Ctr Brain Imaging, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA","University of Rochester; University of Rochester","Schneider, KA (corresponding author), Sherman Hlth Sci Res Ctr, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.","keiths@yorku.ca",,"Schneider, Keith/0000-0001-7120-3380",,,,,87,31,33,0,6,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Much has been learned about basic principles of cortical neurophysiology on account of the intense investigation of the transformation between LGN and V1. Here we present a discussion of different models for visual cortex and orientation selectivity, and then discuss our own experimental findings about the dynamics of orientation selectivity. We consider what these theoretical analyses and experimental results imply about cerebral cortical function.

Positron emission tomography, which has previously identified resting state blood flow abnormalities in depression, was used to investigate neural activity associated with performance of this task in depressed patients and normal controls. Methods. Six patients with unipolar depression and six matched controls were scanned while performing easy and hard Tower of London problems in a one-touch computerized paradigm and while performing a perceptuomotor control task. Results, The patients in this study showed an expected task-related performance deficit compared with normal subjects. In normal subjects, the task engaged a network of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior cortical areas and subcortical structures including the striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. Depressed patients failed to show significant activation in the cingulate and striatum; activation in the other prefrontal and posterior cortical regions was significantly attenuated relative to controls. Crucially, patients also failed to show the normal augmentation of activation in the caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortex associated with increasing task difficulty. Conclusions, These findings provide evidence for cingulate, prefrontal and striatal dysfunction associated with impaired task performance in depression. The present results are consistent with a central role of cingulate dysfunction in depression as well as suggesting impaired frontostriatal function.","UCL, HAMMERSMITH HOSP,MRC CYCLOTRON UNIT, WELLCOME DEPT COGNIT NEUROL,INST NEUROL, LONDON WC1 3BG, ENGLAND; UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT EXPT PSYCHOL, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1TN, ENGLAND; UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT PSYCHIAT, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1TN, ENGLAND; ROYAL FREE HOSP, SCH MED, LONDON, ENGLAND","Imperial College London; University of London; University College London; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of London; University College London; Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust; UCL Medical School",,,"Sahakian, Barbara/AAW-1198-2020; Frith, Chris D/A-2171-2009; Rogers, Robert/AAF-7621-2019","Sahakian, Barbara/0000-0001-7352-1745; Frith, Chris D/0000-0002-8665-0690; Rogers, Robert/0000-0001-5010-069X; Elliott, Rebecca/0000-0002-7602-010X; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X","Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,53,258,267,0,17,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0033-2917",,,"PSYCHOL MED","Psychol.

The insula has a dynamic cytoarchitectonic arrangement throughout its length. The anterior insula is comprised of an agranular-allocortical area which functionally is part of the paralimbic belt. Its cortical connections are predominantly with other allocortical areas. Subcortical, limbic, and brain stem connections underscore the anterior insula's role in processing and integrating autonomic and visceral information, The posterior insula is comprised of a granular-isocortical area which functionally is linked to somatomotor systems. Its cortical connections are predominantly with other neocortical areas. Insular-cortical and sub-cortical connections, especially with the thalamus and basal ganglia, underscore the posterior insula's role in somatosensory, vestibular, and motor integration. The dysgranular insula lying in between the anterior and posterior insula represents an anatomical and functional transition between these regions. The predominant flow of intra-insular projections from anterior to more posterior regions suggests that the posterior insula also serves as an integrative heteromodal association area for information received by all five senses. The insula plays a role in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, vestibular, olfactory, gustatory, visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor modulation. It is also felt to play a role in conditioned aversive learning, affective and motivational components of pain perception, stress induced immunosuppression, mood stability, sleep, and language. Clinical correlation of damage to the insula, and the resultant impairment of the above functions is discussed.","Madigan Army Med Ctr, Tacoma, WA 98431 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; Miami Inst Psychol, Miami, FL USA","Madigan Army Medical Center; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Flynn, FG (corresponding author), Madigan Army Med Ctr, Tacoma, WA 98431 USA.",,,,,,,,127,184,191,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0268-7038","1464-5041",,"APHASIOLOGY","Aphasiology","JAN",1999,13,1,,,,,55,78,,"10.1080/026870399402325","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026870399402325"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026870399402325"")",,,24,"Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Clinical Neurology; Rehabilitation","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation","159MR",,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000078177900006","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000078177900006"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Findings from this study in rats suggest that for androgens, this influence may include stimulation of underlying corticocortical connections. First, immunoreactivity for intracellular androgen receptors, while present in all regions and layers examined, was found to be particularly abundant in sensory and motor regions, and within these, within their major pyramidal cell layers, i.e. layers II/III and V/VI. Double labeling immunocytochemical studies for androgen receptors and for neuron-specific markers then confirmed that the majority of receptor-bearing cortical cells were pyramidal neurons. Finally, combined analyses of cortical receptor immunoreactivity and retrograde labeling produced by tracer injections made in specific subcortical (caudate, nucleus accumbens, superior colliculus, thalamus) areas yielded only isolated examples of receptor/tracer overlap. However, injections made within the cortex itself (sensory, motor, associational areas) retrogradely labeled cortical cells some 50% or more - especially within injected hemispheres, were receptor-immunoreactive. Thus, the regional, laminar, and cellular distributions of immunoreactivity in the rat cerebrum largely identify pyramidal neurons with connectional signatures aligning intracellular androgen receptors with the local, associational, and to a lesser degree, callosal circuits that interlink territories of the cortical mantle and play key roles in cortical information processing.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook","Kritzer, M (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","mkritzer@notes.cc.sunysb.edu",,,"NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS41966] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,57,59,62,0,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Experiments in macaque monkeys show that these two kinds of impairment are functionally similar to each other. After any lesion that interrupts the Delay-Brion system (hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies and anterior thalamus) monkeys are impaired in scene-specific memory where an event takes place against a background that is specific to that event. Scene-specific memory in the monkey corresponds to human episodic memory, which is the memory of a unique event set in a particular scene, as opposed to scene-independent human knowledge, which is abstracted from many different scenes. However interruption of the Delay-Brion system is not sufficient to explain all of the memory impairments that are seen in amnesic patients. To explain amnesia the specialized function of the hippocampus in scene memory needs to be considered alongside the other, qualitatively different functional specializations of other memory systems of the temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex and the amygdala. In all these specialized areas, however, including the hippocampus, there is no fundamental distinction between memory systems and perceptual systems. In explaining memory disorders in amnesia it is also important to consider them alongside the memory disorders of neglect patients. Neglect patients fail to represent in memory the side of the world that is contralateral to the current fixation point, in both short-and long-term memory retrieval. Neglect was produced experimentally by unilateral visual disconnection in the monkey, confirming the idea that visual memory retrieval is retinotopically organized; patients with unilateral medial temporal-lobe removals showed lateralized memory impairments for half-scenes in the visual hemifield contralateral to the removal. Thus, in scene-memory retrieval the Delay-Brion system contributes to the retrieval of visual memories into the retinotopically organized visual cortex. This scene memory interpretation of hippocampal function needs to be contrasted with the cognitive-map hypothesis. The cognitive-map model of hippocampal function shares some common assumptions with the Hebb-synapse model of association formation, and the Hebb-synapse model can be rejected on the basis of recent evidence that monkeys can form direct associations in memory between temporally discontiguous events. Our general conclusion is that the primate brain encompasses widespread and powerful memory mechanisms which will continue to be poorly understood if theory and experimentation continue to concentrate too much, as they have in the past, on the hippocampus and the Hebb synapse.",,,"Gaffan, D (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,DEPT EXPT PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,51,17,17,0,4,"ROYAL SOC LONDON","LONDON","6 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON, ENGLAND SW1Y 5AG","0962-8436",,,"PHILOS T ROY SOC B","Philos.

The dominant retinogeniculostriate pathway has been an area of extensive study, and Vivien Casagrande's work in examining the once overlooked koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus has generated interest in how alternate subcortical pathways can contribute to visual perception. Another subcortical visual relay center is the inferior pulvinar (PI), which has four subdivisions and numerous connections with other subcortical and cortical areas and is directly recipient of retinal afferents. The complexity of subcortical connections associated with the PI subdivisions has led to differing results from various groups. A particular challenge in determining the exact connectivity pattern has been in accurately targeting the subdivisions of the PI with neural tracers. Therefore, in the present study, we used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotaxic injection system to inject bidirectional tracers in the separate subdivisions of the PI, the superior layers of the superior colliculus, the retina, and the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results have determined for the first time that the medial inferior pulvinar (PIm) is innervated by widefield retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and this pathway is not a collateral branch of the geniculate and collicular projecting RGCs.

Domoic acid-induced convulsions affects Limbic structures such as hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and different anatomic markers can detect these neurotoxic effects to varying degrees, Here we report effects of domoic acid administration on quantitative indicators of brain metabolism and gliosis. Domoic acid, 2.25 mg/kg i.p., caused stereotyped behavior and convulsions in approximately 60% of rats which received it. Six to eight days after domoic acid or vehicle administration, the animals were processed to measure regional brain incorporation of the long-chain fatty acids [1-C-14]arachidonic acid ([C-14]AA) and [9,10-H-3]palmitic acid ([H-3]PA), or regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMR(glc)) using 2-[1-C-14]deoxy-D-glucose, by quantitative autoradiography. Others rats were processed to measure brain glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Domoic acid increased GFAP in the anterior portion of cerebral cortex, the caudate putamen and thalamus compared with vehicle. However, in rats that convulsed after domoic acid GFAP was significantly increased throughout the cerebral cortex, as well as in the hippocampus, septum, caudate putamen, and thalamus. Domoic acid, in the absence of convulsions, decreased relative [C-14]AA incorporation in the claustrum and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus compared with vehicle-injected controls, In the presence of convulsions, relative [C-14]AA incorporation was decreased in hippocampus regions CAl and CA2. Uptake of [H-3]PA into brain was unaffected. Relative rCMR(glc) decreased in entorhinal cortex following domoic acid administration with or without convulsions. These results suggest that acute domoic acid exposure affects discrete brain circuits by inducing convulsions, and that domoic acid-induced convulsions cause chronic effects on brain function that are reflected in altered fatty acid metabolism and gliosis.

In this study, the functional anatomy of cognitive planning was investigated further, using positron emission tomography (PET). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 12 normal volunteers while performing easy and difficult versions of (i) a modified Tower of London planning task; (ii) a mnemonic Variant of this task that required short-term retention and reproduction of problem solutions; and (iii) a control condition that involved identical visual stimuli and motor responses. Significant increases in rCBF were observed in the left hemisphere, in both the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and in the head of the caudate nucleus, when the difficult planning task was compared with the control condition. Moreover, subtraction of a simple planning condition from the more difficult one revealed focal increases in rCBF in the caudate nucleus and the thalamus only. During both mnemonic variants of the planning task, changes were also observed in the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and in more ventral frontopolar regions, bilaterally. When compared directly, the planning and memory conditions differed in terms of these ventral activation foci, but not in the pattern of activation observed in the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex. These findings further implicate frontostriatal circuitry in high-level planning and provide evidence for functionally distinct contributions from ventral and dorsolateral frontal regions to spatial working memory.","UNIV LAVAL, DEPT PSYCHOL, QUEBEC CITY, PQ G1K 7P4, CANADA; UNIV LAVAL, NEUROBIOL RES CTR, QUEBEC CITY, PQ G1K 7P4, CANADA","Laval University; Laval University","Owen, AM (corresponding author), MCGILL UNIV, MONTREAL NEUROL INST, COGNIT NEUROSCI UNIT, MONTREAL, PQ H3A 2B4, CANADA.",,"Owen, Adrian M/B-4997-2015",,,,,,52,396,400,0,16,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Disturbances of the fronto-striatal-thalamic pathways responsible for motor control and impulse inhibition have been previously described in other studies. Although differences in motor performance are well recognized, imaging data elucidating the neuronal correlates are scarce. Here, we examined 19 adult TS patients (13 men, aged 22-52 years, mean = 34.3 years) and 18 age-and sex-matched controls (13 men, aged 24-57 years, mean = 37.6 years) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study at 1.5 T. We corrected for possible confounds introduced by tics, motion, and brain-structural differences as well as age, sex, comorbidities, and medication. Patients and controls were asked to perform a sequential finger-tapping task using their right, left, and both hands, respectively. Task performance was monitored by simultaneous MR-compatible video recording. Although behavioral data obtained during scanning did not show significant differences across groups, we observed differential neuronal activation patterns depending on both handedness (dominant vs. nondominant) and tapping frequency in frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas. When controlling for open motor performance, a failure of deactivation in easier task conditions was found in the subgenual cingulate cortex in the TS patients. In addition, performance-related functional connectivity of lower-and higher-order motor networks differed between patients and controls. In summary, although open performance was comparable, patients showed different neuronal networks and connectivity patterns when performing increasingly demanding tasks, further illustrating the impact of the disease on the motor system.

Activations were seen in the cortical and subcortical components of a previously characterized attentional network, namely, the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the putamen, and the thalamus, Additional activations occurred in the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital cortex in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum. Direct comparisons showed a nearly complete overlap in the location of activations resulting from the two tasks. However, the spatial priming task displayed a more pronounced rightward asymmetry of parietal activation, and a conjunction analysis showed that the area of posterior parietal cortex jointly activated by both tasks was more extensive in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, the posterior parietal and temporo-occipital activations were more pronounced in the task of endogenous attentional shifts. The results show that both exogenous (based on spatial priming) and endogenous (based on expectancy cueing) shifts of attention are subserved by a common network of cortical and subcortical regions. However, the differences between the two tasks, especially in the degree of rightward asymmetry, suggests that the pattern of activation within this network may show variations that reflect the specific attributes of the attentional task.

Here, by delivering intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to the supplementary eye fields (SEF) of monkeys performing interleaved pro- and anti-saccades, we show a surprising diversity of state-dependent effects of ICMS-SEF. Short-duration ICMS-SEF passed around cue presentation selectively disrupted anti-saccades by increasing reaction times and error rates bilaterally, and also recruited neck muscles, favoring contralateral head turning to a greater degree on anti-saccade trials. These results are consistent with the functional relevance of the SEF for anti-saccades. The multiplicity of stimulation-evoked effects, with ICMS-SEF simultaneously disrupting anti-saccade performance and facilitating contralateral head orienting, probably reflects both the diversity of cortical and subcortical targets of SEF projections, and the response of this oculomotor network to stimulation. We speculate that the bilateral disruption of anti-saccades arises via feedback loops that may include the thalamus, whereas neck muscle recruitment arises via feedforward polysynaptic pathways to the motor periphery. Consideration of both sets of results reveals a more complete picture of the highly complex and multiphasic response to ICMS-SEF that can play out differently in different effector systems.","[Chapman, Brendan B.] Univ Western Ontario, Grad Program Neurosci, London, ON, Canada; [Corneil, Brian D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, London, ON, Canada; [Corneil, Brian D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada; [Corneil, Brian D.] John P Robarts Res Inst, London, ON N6A 5K8, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Corneil, BD (corresponding author), John P Robarts Res Inst, POB 5015, London, ON N6A 5K8, Canada.","bcorneil@uwo.ca","Corneil, Brian D/K-6401-2013","Corneil, Brian D/0000-0002-4702-7089","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 93796, 120772]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN 311680]; Ontario Graduate Scholarship","Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship)","This work was supported by operating grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 93796, 120772) and a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN 311680).

This estimate was based on the F-18-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measured by means of positron emission tomography and compared, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), with that of six control subjects. The contrast [CH children - Controls] showed that CH children had two loci of relatively higher FDG uptake. The larger voxel cluster was found in the ipsilesional hemisphere and comprised the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and left inferior parietal lobule. The other cluster was located in the contralesional hemisphere and encompassed the primary motor cortex, callosomarginal sulcus, and cingulate gyrus. The reverse contrast [Controls - CH children] showed that control subjects had a relatively higher FDG uptake bilaterally in the temporal and hippocampal gyri, the rostral part of the brain stem, the thalami, the putamen, and the superior frontal gyri. A crossed cerebellar diaschisis was not observed in CH children. This relatively higher FDG uptake in the ipsi- and contralesional motor areas of CH children stands out in contrast to the hypometabolism (diaschisis) frequently observed in adult stroke patients with a subcortical lesion. This increased FDG uptake in the disconnected ipsilesional motor areas may reflect a long-term adaptation leading, for example, to an increased synaptic density and/or activity or to a change in the density of glucose transporters.

The ventral capsule/ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) region is a clinically approved target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review to define clinically relevant anatomy and connectivity of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum and NAc region to guide target selection for deep brain stimulation. RESULTS: Architecturally and functionally, the NAc is divided into the core and the shell, with each area having different connections. The shell primarily receives limbic information, and the core typically receives information from the motor system. In general, afferents from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are excitatory. The dopaminergic projections to the NAc from the ventral tegmental area modulate the balance of these excitatory inputs. Several important inputs to the NAc converge at the junction of the internal capsule (IC) and the anterior commissure (AC): the ventral amygdalofugal pathways that run parallel to and underneath the AC, the precommissural fornical fibers that run anterior to the AC, axons from the ventral prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex that occupy the most ventral part of the IC and embedding within the NAc and AC, and the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle located parallel to the anterior thalamic radiation in the IC. CONCLUSIONS: The caudal part of the NAc passing through the IC-AC junction may be an effective target for deep brain stimulation to improve behavioral symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.","[Park, Yong-Sook] Chung Ang Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Seoul, South Korea; [Sammartino, Francesco; Young, Nicole A.; Corrigan, John; Krishna, Vibhor] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rezai, Ali R.] West Virginia Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Morgantown, WV USA","Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University Hospital; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; West Virginia University","Krishna, V (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","vibhorkrishna@yahoo.com","Krishna, Vibhor/AAG-3809-2019","Krishna, Vibhor/0000-0002-4141-4192",,,,,131,25,25,1,6,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1878-8750","1878-8769",,"WORLD NEUROSURG","World Neurosurg.","JUN",2019,126,,,,,,1,10,,"10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.254","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.254"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.254"")",,,10,"Clinical Neurology; Surgery","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery","IA0BU",30790738,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000469222400196","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000469222400196"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The present study explores the link between endogenous dynamics of functional connectivity and autonomic state in an eyes-closed resting condition. Using a sliding window analysis on resting state fMRI data from 35 young, healthy male subjects, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) covaries with temporal changes in whole-brain functional connectivity with seed regions previously described to mediate effects of vigilance and arousal (amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex: dACC). We identified a set of regions, including brainstem, thalamus, putamen, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that became more strongly coupled with the dACC and amygdala seeds during states of elevated HRV. Effects differed between high and low frequency components of HRV, suggesting specific contributions of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone on individual connections. Furthermore, dynamics of functional connectivity could be separated from those primarily related to BOLD signal fluctuations. The present results contribute novel information about the neural basis of transient changes of autonomic nervous system states, and suggest physiological and psychological components of the recently observed non-stationarity in resting state functional connectivity.

As a result, the functional roles of these subdivisions in humans have not been investigated physiologically. To functionally map the M and P subdivisions of human LGN, we used high-resolution fMRI at high field (7 T and 3 T) together with a combination of spatial, temporal, luminance, and chromatic stimulus manipulations. We found that stimulus factors that differentially drive magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in primate LGN also elicit differential BOLD fMRI responses in human LGN and that these responses exhibit a spatial organization consistent with the known anatomical organization of the M and P subdivisions. In test-retest studies, the relative responses of individual voxels to M-type and P-type stimuli were reliable across scanning sessions on separate days and across sessions at different field strengths. The ability to functionally identify magnocellular and parvocellular regions of human LGN with fMRI opens possibilities for investigating the functions of these subdivisions in human visual perception, in patient populations with suspected abnormalities in one of these subdivisions, and in visual cortical processing streams arising from parallel thalamocortical pathways.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated image analysis technique allowing identification of regional differences in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) between groups of subjects without a prior region of interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whole-brain GM and WM changes in TLE and to investigate the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical parameters. We studied 85 patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE and unilateral hippocampal atrophy and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The seizure focus was right sided in 40 patients and left sided in 45. Student's t test statistical maps of differences between patients' and controls' GM and WM concentrations were obtained using a general linear model. A further regression against duration of epilepsy, age of onset, presence of febrile convulsions, and secondary generalized seizures was performed with the TLE population. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that GM pathology in TLE extends beyond the hippocampus involving other limbic areas such as the cingulum and the thalamus, as well as extralimbic areas, particularly the frontal lobe. White matter reduction was found only ipsilateral to the seizure focus, including the temporopolar, entorhinal, and perirhinal areas. This pattern of structural changes is suggestive of disconnection involving preferentially frontolimbic pathways in patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear-related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the medial prefrontal network, is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex. The overall function of this circuit is unclear, but may be involved in introspective monitoring of the individual.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL)","Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","pricej@wustl.edu","Winwood, Peter/A-6363-2008",,,,,,66,107,108,0,25,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

The majority of fibers that exit cerebellar cortex synapse in dentate nuclei (DN) before reaching extracerebellar structures such as cerebral cortex, but the functional neuroanatomy of human DN remains largely unmapped. Neuroimaging research has redefined broad categories of functional division in the human brain showing that primary processing, attentional (task positive) processing, and default-mode (task negative) processing are three central poles of neural macroscale functional organization. This broad spectrum of human neural processing categories is represented not only in the cerebral cortex, but also in the thalamus, striatum, and cerebellar cortex. Whether functional organization in DN obeys a similar set of macroscale divisions, and whether DN are yet another compartment of representation of a broad spectrum of human neural processing categories, remains unknown. Here, we show for the first time that human DN are optimally divided into three functional territories as indexed by high spatio-temporal resolution resting-state MRI in 77 healthy humans, and that these three distinct territories contribute uniquely to default-mode, salience-motor, and visual cerebral cortical networks. Our findings provide a systems neuroscience substrate for cerebellar output to influence multiple broad categories of neural control.","[Guell, Xavier; D'Mello, Anila M.; Hubbard, Nicholas A.; Romeo, Rachel R.; Gabrieli, John D.

We examined how signal transmission is regulated in the macaque LGN by recording the retinal input to a single LGN neuron while stimulating the receptive field center with a naturalistic luminance sequence. After extracting the EPSPs, which are often partially merged with spike waveforms, we found that > 95% of spikes were associated with an EPSP from a single retinal ganglion cell. Each spike within a  burst train was generated by an EPSP, indicating that LGN bursts are inherited from retinal bursts. LGN neurons rarely fired unless at least two EPSPs summated within 40 ms. This facilitation in EPSP efficacy was followed by depression. If a spike was generated by the first EPSP in a pair, it did not alter the efficacy of the second EPSP. Hence, the timing of EPSPs arising from the primary retinal driver governs synaptic efficacy and provides the basis for successful retinogeniculate transmission.","Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","University of California System; University of California San Francisco","Sincich, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, 10 Koret Way, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.","sincichl@vision.ucsf.edu","Adams, Daniel L/A-5229-2009; Economides, John/AAV-7631-2020","Adams, Daniel L/0000-0003-0376-4949; Economides, John/0000-0002-9236-2441; Horton, Jonathan/0000-0002-3952-435X","NEI NIH HHS [P30 EY002162, EY10217, R56 EY010217, EY02162, R01 EY010217] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,68,76,76,0,8,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Therefore, the differential effects of caloric vestibular stimulation (right or left ear irrigation with warm water at 44degreesC) on cortical and subcortical activation were studied in 12 right-handed and 12 left-handed healthy volunteers. Caloric irrigation induces a direction-specific sensation of rotation and nystagmus. Significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were found in a network within both hemispheres, including the superior frontal gyrus/sulcus, the precentral gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule with the supramarginal gyrus. These areas correspond best to the cortical ocular motor centres, namely the prefrontal cortex, the frontal eye field and the parietal eye field, known to be involved in the processing of caloric nystagmus. Furthermore, distinct temporo-parietal activations could be separated in the posterior part of the insula with the adjacent superior temporal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule and precuneus. These areas fit best to the human homologues of multisensory vestibular cortex areas identified in the monkey and correspond to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), the visual temporal sylvian area (VTS) and areas 7 and 6. Further cortical activations were seen in the anterior insula, the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulum. The subcortical activation pattern in the putamen, thalamus and midbrain is consistent with the organization of efferent ocular motor pathways. Cortical and subcortical activation of the described areas was bilateral during monaural stimulation, but predominant in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated ear and exhibited a significant right hemispheric dominance for vestibular and ocular motor structures in right-handed volunteers. Similarly, a significant left hemispheric dominance was found in the 12 left-handed volunteers. Thus, this PET study showed for the first time that cortical and subcortical activation by vestibular caloric stimulation depends (i) on the handedness of the subjects and (ii) on the side of the stimulated ear. Maximum activation was therefore found when the non-dominant hemisphere was ipsilateral to the stimulated ear, i.e. in the right hemisphere of right-handed subjects during caloric irrigation of the right ear and in the left hemisphere of left-handed subjects during caloric irrigation of the left ear. The localization of handedness and vestibular dominance in opposite hemispheres might conceivably indicate that the vestibular system and its hemispheric dominance, which matures earlier during ontogenesis, determine right- or left-handedness.","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, D-61377 Mainz, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Nucl Med, D-8000 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany; Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Nucl Med, D-6500 Mainz, Germany","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Technical University of Munich; University of Munich; University of Munich; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Dieterich, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-61377 Mainz, Germany.","dieterich@neurologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de",,"Drzezga, Alexander/0000-0001-6018-716X",,,,,77,402,416,1,20,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

The loss of C with bilateral thalamic lesions involving the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) contrasts with retention of C after large cortical ablations depriving C of specific contents. A role of ILN in the perception of primitive (i.e., not cortically computed) sensations is suggested by their afference of directly ascending pathways. A role for ILN in awareness of cortical activity is suggested by their widespread afference from cortex, a property shared with striatum. A role for ILN in volition is suggested by their heavy projection to striatum. Unlike striatum, ILN also project widely to almost all neocortex, enabling an effect on ideation; this last property is in common with other structures (e.g., locus coeruleus) but none of them has the same direct cortical afference. And passage through the reticular nucleus (nRt) of ILN efferents to cortex could impact the attention-selective action of nRt. It is suggested that the quickest route to a better understanding of C involves more intensive study of ILN. No other structure seems, in the light of our current knowledge, a more likely site for Mc.

The rat posterior parietal cortex is part of a cortical network that also includes the medial agranular and ventrolateral orbital areas. Each of these three cortical areas is a region of multimodal convergence. Bilateral destruction of any of these areas produces deficits in spatial learning, whereas unilateral lesions induce deficits in directed attention. These findings suggest that together these cortical regions form an integrated network for spatial processing and orientation. In a recent test of this hypothesis, the posterior parietal area was selectively disconnected from the medial agranular cortex without direct damage to either area. This resulted in severe neglect which was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that produced by unilateral destruction of wither cortical area, thereby supporting the network hypothesis. Some earlier conflicting reports bearing on the functional role of rat posterior parietal cortex may be explained in light of these disconnection data. The anatomical and behavioral findings suggest that in rats, as in primates, a parieto-frontal network mediates the integrated, dynamic spatial representations essential for normal directed attention and spatial orientation.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; Univ Florida, Dept Physiol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA","Northern Illinois University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Corwin, JV (corresponding author), No Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.","tj0jvc1@corn.cso.niu.edu",,,,,,,108,44,44,0,12,"PSYCHONOMIC SOC INC","AUSTIN","1710 FORTVIEW RD, AUSTIN, TX 78704 USA","0889-6313",,,"PSYCHOBIOLOGY","Psychobiology","JUN",1998,26,2,,,,,87,102,,,,,,16,"Psychology; Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Psychology","ZY396",,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000074617100002","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000074617100002"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Recent patient studies have, however, re-established the mammillary bodies, and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, as being crucial for recollective memory. Complementary animal research has also made substantial advances in recent years by determining the electrophysiological, neurochemical, anatomical and functional properties of the mammillary bodies. Mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract lesions in rats impair performance on a number of spatial memory tasks and these deficits are consistent with impoverished spatial encoding. The mammillary bodies have traditionally been considered a hippocampal relay which is consistent with the equivalent deficits seen following lesions of the mammillary bodies or their major efferents, the mammillothalamic tract. However, recent findings suggest that the mammillary bodies may have a role in memory that is independent of their hippocampal formation afferents; instead, the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden could be providing critical mammillary body inputs needed to support mnemonic processes. Finally, it is now apparent that the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei should be considered separately and initial research indicates that the medial mammillary nucleus is predominantly responsible for the spatial memory deficits following mammillary body lesions in rats.

Non-symbolic number cognition based on an approximate sense of magnitude has been documented in a variety of vertebrate species, including fish. Fish, in particular zebrafish, are widely used as models for the investigation of the genetics and molecular mechanisms of behavior, and thus may be instrumental to development of a neurobiology of number cognition. We review here the behavioural studies that have permitted to identify numerical abilities in fish, and the current status of the research related to the neurobiological bases of these abilities with special reference to zebrafish. Combining behavioural tasks with molecular genetics, molecular biology and confocal microscopy, a role of the retina and optic tectum in the encoding of continuous magnitude in larval zebrafish has been reported, while the thalamus and the dorso-central subdivision of pallium in the encoding of discrete magnitude (number) has been documented in adult zebrafish. Research in fish, in particular zebrafish, may reveal instrumental for identifying and characterizing the molecular signature of neurons involved in quantity discrimination processes of all vertebrates, including humans.It is widely acknowledged that vertebrates can discriminate non-symbolic numerosity using an evolutionarily conserved system dubbed Approximate Number System (ANS). Two main approaches have been used to assess behaviourally numerosity in fish: spontaneous choice tests and operant training procedures. In the first, animals spontaneously choose between sets of biologically-relevant stimuli (e.g., conspecifics, food) differing in quantities (smaller or larger). In the second, animals are trained to associate a numerosity with a reward. Although the ability of fish to discriminate numerosity has been widely documented with these methods, the molecular bases of quantities estimation and ANS are largely unknown. Recently, we combined behavioral tasks with molecular biology assays (e.g c-fos and egr1 and other early genes expression) showing that the thalamus and the caudal region of dorso-central part of the telencephalon seem to be activated upon change in numerousness in visual stimuli. In contrast, the retina and the optic tectum mainly responded to changes in continuous magnitude such as stimulus size. We here provide a review and synthesis of these findings.","[Messina, Andrea; Potrich, Davide; Schiona, Ilaria; Sovrano, Valeria Anna; Vallortigara, Giorgio] Univ Trento, Ctr Mind Brain Sci, I-38068 Rovereto, Italy; [Sovrano, Valeria Anna] Univ Trento, Dept Psychol & Cognit Sci, I-38068 Rovereto, Italy","University of Trento; University of Trento","Messina, A; Vallortigara, G (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Ctr Mind Brain Sci, I-38068 Rovereto, Italy.","andrea.messina@unitn.it; davide.potrich@unitn.it; ilaria.schiona@unitn.it; valeriaanna.sovrano@unitn.it; giorgio.vallortigara@unitn.it","Messina, Andrea/ABZ-1226-2022","Potrich, Davide/0000-0003-0928-628X; Messina, Andrea/0000-0001-7363-4301; Sovrano, Valeria Anna/0000-0001-8962-2874; Vallortigara, Giorgio/0000-0001-8192-9062","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [833504-SPANUMBRA]; PRIN 2017 grant [2017PSRHPZ]","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); PRIN 2017 grant","This project has received funding also from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 833504-SPANUMBRA) to G.V. and a PRIN 2017 grant (2017PSRHPZ) to G.V.",,167,8,8,5,15,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2076-2615",,,"ANIMALS-BASEL","Animals","NOV",2021,11,11,,,,,,,3072,"10.3390/ani11113072","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11113072"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11113072"")",,,17,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology","XE4GP",34827804,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000723348300001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000723348300001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In middle-aged gerbils (16 months old), the hippocampus exhibited a significant elevation in [H-3]QNB, [H-3]MK-801, [H-3]SCH 23390, [H-3]naloxone, and [H-3]PN200-110 binding, whereas [H-3]CHA and [H-3]muscimol binding showed a significant reduction in this area, compared with that of young animals (1 month). On the other hand, the cerebellum showed a significant alteration in [H-3]QNB, [H-3]CHA, and [H-3]naloxone binding and the striatum also exhibited a significant alteration in [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]CHA binding in middle-aged gerbils. The neocortex showed a significant elevation only in [H-3]CHA binding in middle-aged animals. The nucleus accumbens and thalamus also showed a significant alteration only in [H-3]muscimol binding. However, the hypothalamus and substantia nigra exhibited no significant alteration in these bindings in middle-aged gerbils. These results demonstrate the age-related alterations of various neurotransmitter receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels in most brain regions. Furthermore, they suggest that the hippocampus is most susceptible to aging processes and is altered at an early stage of senescence.","TOKYO TANABE CO LTD,RES LABS,PHARMACOL RES LAB,KITA KU,TOKYO 115,JAPAN",,"ARAKI, T (corresponding author), TOHOKU UNIV,SCH MED,INST BRAIN DIS,DEPT NEUROL,1-1 SEIRYO MACHI,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN.",,,,,,,,40,18,19,0,0,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB","0197-0186",,,"NEUROCHEM INT","Neurochem.

To investigate the behavioural and neural correlates of motivation in unmedicated PD patients, we used (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography to measure brain activation patterns related to the processing of monetary rewards of different magnitudes during a spatial search task in PD patients withdrawn from medication, and age-matched healthy controls. Both groups showed increased search efficiency with increasing reward, but demonstrated different patterns of neuronal activation. In healthy controls activity in prefrontal and rhinal cortices, and thalamic activity correlated with reward magnitude. In contrast, activity in the cerebellar vermis in PD patients increased with increasing reward magnitude, suggesting it was sensitive to motivational state. We interpret these relative increases in cerebellar activation as evidence for the presence of compensatory neural mechanisms in unmedicated PD patients.","MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 2EF, England; Hammersmith Hosp, Imperial Coll, Fac Med, Div Neurosci, London, England; Hammersmith Hosp, Imperial Coll, Fac Med, MRC,Clin Sci Ctr, London, England","Imperial College London; Imperial College London","Lawrence, AD (corresponding author), MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, 15 Chaucer Rd, Cambridge CB2 2EF, England.","andrew.lawrence@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk","Lawrence, Andrew D/A-1673-2010","Brooks, David/0000-0003-2602-2518",,,,,75,40,44,0,4,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Three different tracers were used: biotin-conjugated dextranamine (BDA), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and H-3-leucine. Intracortical projections were found to the motor cortex around the injection site, the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, the homologues of the primate frontoparietal operculum and insula, the anterior cingulate and agrannular retrosplenial cortex, the somatosensory and bordering inferior parietal cortex as well as to the perirhinal cortex. Except the very weak projections into the retrosplenial, posterior parietal and perirhinal region which were ipsilateral, all other projections were bilateral. Subcortically, there was a projection into the ventral putamen, rostrodorsal claustrum and, very sparsely, into the caudate nucleus. In the rhalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei reticularis, anteroventralis, anteromedialis, ventralis lateralis, ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis posterior inferior, medialis dorsalis, in the intralaminar nuclei paracentralis, centralis lateralis, centrum medianum and parafascicularis, in the midline thalamus and in the nuclei posterior and pulvinaris. Further diencephalic projections, however all of them weak, could be traced into the zona incerta, dorsolateral subthalamus, dorsomedial, lateral and supraoptic hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the lateral superior colliculus, in the bordering reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal grey. In the lower brainstem, fibres ended in the griseum pontis, dorsolateral reticular formation, principal and spinal trigeminal nucleus and, sparsely, in the lateral parabrachial region, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olive and magnocellular reticular formation. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus. The projection system revealed with PHA-L was less extensive than that demonstrated with BDA and H-3-leucine, both of which were similar.","GERMAN PRIMATE CTR,DEPT NEUROBIOL,D-37077 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY","Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ)",,,,,,,,,49,9,9,0,2,"V W B -VERLAG WISSENSCHAFT & BILDUNG","BERLIN","AMAND AGLASTER, POSTFACH 11 03 68, D-10833 BERLIN, GERMANY","0944-8160",,,"J BRAIN RES","J.

We histologically assessed these regions in 6 postmortem cases, plotted a flat map, and characterized differences in dorsal (d) and ventral (v) area 23. Subsequently, functional connectivity of histologically guided regions of interest (ROI) were assessed in 163 [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose human cases with PET. Compared to area d23, area v23 had a higher density and larger pyramids in layers II, IIIc, and Vb and more intermediate neurofilament-expressing neurons in layer Va. Coregisirtration of each case to standard coordinates showed that the ventral branch of the splenial sulci coincided with the border between d/v PCC at -5.4 +/- 0.17 cm from the vertical plane and +1.97 +/- 0.08 cm from the bi-commissural line. Correlation analysis of glucose metabolism using histologically guided ROIs suggested important circuit differences including dorsal and ventral visual stream inputs, interactions between the vPCC and subgenual cingulate cortex, and preferential relations between dPCC and the cingulate motor region. The RSC, in contrast, had restricted correlated activity with pericallosal cortex and thalamus. Visual information may be processed with an orbitofrontal link for synthesis activity through dPCC. Review of the of signals to drive premotor literature in terms of a PCC duality suggests that interactions of dPCC, including area 23d, orient the body in space via the cingulate motor areas, while vPCC interacts with subgenual cortex to process self-relevant emotional and non-emotional information and objects and self-reflection.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural response to scenes that were visually distinct (beach images vs freeway images) and experienced as tranquil (beach) or non-tranquil (freeway) Both sets of scenes had the same auditory component because waves breaking on a beach and vehicles moving on a freeway can produce similar auditory spectral and temporal characteristics. perceived as a constant roar Compared with scenes experienced as non-tranquil, we found that subjectively tranquil scenes were associated with significantly greater effective connectivity between the auditory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in the evaluation of mental states Similarly enhanced connectivity was also observed between the auditory cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal cortex and thalamus. These findings demonstrate that visual context can modulate connectivity of the auditory cortex with regions implicated in the generation of subjective states Importantly, this effect arises under conditions of identical auditory input. Hence, the same sound may be associated with different percepts reflecting varying connectivity between the auditory cortex and other brain regions. This suggests that subjective experience is more closely linked to the connectivity state of the auditory cortex than to its basic sensory inputs (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved","[Hunter, M.

Our fMRI results show that a load increase in a nonverbal auditory working memory task is associated with enhanced brain activity in the parietal, dorsal premotor, and lateral prefrontal cortices and in lobules VII-VIII of the posterior cerebellum, whereas a sensory-motor control task activated the motor/somatosensory, medial prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices and lobules V/VI of the anterior cerebellum. The load-dependent activity in the crus I/II had a specific relationship with cognitive performance: This activity correlated negatively with load-dependent increase in RTs. This correlation between brain activity and RTs was not observed in the sensory-motor task in the activated cerebellar regions. Furthermore, probabilistic tractography analysis of the diffusion-weighted MRI data suggests that the tracts between the cerebral and the cerebellar areas exhibiting cognitive load-dependent and sensory-motor activity are mainly projected via separated pontine (feed-forward tracts) and thalamic (feedback tracts) nuclei. The tractography results also indicate that the crus I/II in the posterior cerebellum is linked with the lateral prefrontal areas activated by cognitive load increase, whereas the anterior cerebellar lobe is not. The current results support the view that cognitive and motor functions are segregated in the cerebellum. On the basis of these results and theories of the function of the cerebellum, we suggest that the posterior cerebellar activity during a demanding cognitive task is involved with optimization of the response speed.","[Salmi, Juha] Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Salmi, Juha; Neuvonen, Tuomas; Carlson, Synnove] Aalto Univ, FIN-02150 Espoo, Finland; [Pallesen, Karen Johanne] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Pallesen, Karen Johanne] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Brattico, Elvira] Univ Jyvaskyla, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Korvenoja, Antti; Salonen, Oili] Univ Helsinki, Cent Hosp, Med Imaging Ctr, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Carlson, Synnove] Univ Tampere, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland","University of Helsinki; Aalto University; Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen; University of Jyvaskyla; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital","Salmi, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Psychol, POB 9, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.","juha.salmi@helsinki.fi","Salmi, Juha/G-7049-2012; Korvenoja, Antti/AAG-1866-2019; Korvenoja, Antti/AAR-7461-2020; Korvenoja, Antti/C-2292-2009; Carlson, Synnöve/A-6337-2013; Carlson, Synnöve/AAM-2655-2021; Carlson, Synnöve/G-2210-2013; Brattico, Elvira/M-1455-2019","Salmi, Juha/0000-0001-5623-6598; Korvenoja, Antti/0000-0003-4348-0449; Korvenoja, Antti/0000-0003-4348-0449; Carlson, Synnöve/0000-0003-1462-7560; Pallesen, Karen Johanne/0000-0001-7543-5891; Brattico, Elvira/0000-0003-0676-6464","Finnish Cultural Foundation; Instrumentarium Science Foundation; Academy of Finland; University of Helsinki; Finnish Graduate School of Psychology; NIH NCRR [P41 RR09784]","Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Instrumentarium Science Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); University of Helsinki; Finnish Graduate School of Psychology; NIH NCRR(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR))","Special thanks to Christopher J.

However, both aging and estradiol regulate SERT binding sites in the brain. The goal of this experiment was to determine how aging and estrogen interact to regulate SERT levels in the forebrain of young and reproductively senescent female Sprague-Dawley rats using [H-3]paroxetine. The density of specific [H-3]paroxetine binding in various brain regions was compared in young (2-4 months) and reproductively senescent (10-12 months) female rats at three times of day. In most brain regions examined, estrogen and aging independently increased the number of [H-3]paroxetine binding sites. The only region that displayed a reduction in [H-3]paroxetine binding with age was the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Time of day influenced [H-3]paroxetine binding in the SCN and the paraventricular thalamus (PVT), two regions known to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Aging and/or estrogen also altered the pattern of binding in these regions. Thus, based on the results of this study, we conclude that aging and estrogen both act to regulate SERT binding sites in the forebrain of female rats, and that this regulation is region specific.

In Experiment 1, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with a speech task to examine rTMS-induced changes in paralinguistic aspects of speech production, an affect-relevant behavior strongly linked to the ACC. In Experiment 2, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with positron emission tomography (PET) and used partial least squares (PLS) to identify a pattern of brain regions whose connectivity with the site of stimulation varied as a function of rTMS. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that following stimulation of the left MDLFC, subjects reported having less positive affect and vitality and displayed more monotonous speech. In Experiment 2, results revealed that 10-Hz rTMS influenced the covariation between blood flow at the site of stimulation (ie the left MDLFC) and blood flow in a number of affect-relevant brain regions including the perigenual anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in affect and affect-relevant behaviour following 10-Hz rTMS applied over the left MDLFC may be related to changes in neural activity in brain regions widely implicated in affective states, including a frontocingulate circuit.","McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, Cognit Neurosci Unit, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada","McGill University","Paus, T (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, Cognit Neurosci Unit, 3801 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.","tomas@bic.mni.mcgill.ca","Chouinard, Philippe/AEP-6474-2022","Chouinard, Philippe/0000-0001-9817-0689; Della-Maggiore, Valeria/0000-0001-9586-4255",,,,,81,68,79,0,13,"SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","0893-133X","1740-634X",,"NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL","Neuropsychopharmacology","JUN",2004,29,6,,,,,1172,1189,,"10.1038/sj.npp.1300411","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1300411"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1300411"")",,,18,"Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry","825MZ",15029151,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000221763900015","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000221763900015"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

To elucidate the neuronal mechanisms and origin of ECRF suppression in V1 of anesthetized cats, we examined the temporal properties of the spatial extent and orientation specificity of ECRF suppression in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), using stationary-flashed sinusoidal grating. In V1, we found three components of ECRF suppression: 1) local and fast, 2) global and fast, and 3) global and late. The local and fast component, which resulted from within 2 of the boundary of the CRF, started no more than 10 ms after the onset of the CRF response and exhibited low specificity for the orientation of the ECRF stimulus. These spatiotemporal properties corresponded to those of geniculate ECRF suppression, suggesting that the local and fast component of V1 is inherited from the LGN. In contrast, the two global components showed rather large spatial extents similar to 5 degrees from the CRF boundary and high specificity for orientation, suggesting that their possible origin is the cortex, not the LGN. Correspondingly, the local component was observed in all neurons of the thalamocortical recipient layer, while the global component was biased toward other layers. Therefore, we conclude that both subcortical and cortical mechanisms with different spatiotemporal properties are involved in ECRF suppression.","[Shimegi, Satoshi; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan; [Shimegi, Satoshi; Ishikawa, Ayako; Sakamoto, Hiroshi; Hara, Sin-ichiro; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan; [Kida, Hiroyuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan","Osaka University; Osaka University; Osaka University","Shimegi, S (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan.","shimegi@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp",,,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [12210098, 13210086, 14017058, 16015270, 17022026, 19530656, 22500573, 25282216]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25282216, 22500573, 12210098, 13210086, 25750206, 16015270, 14017058, 19530656, 17022026] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Grants 12210098, 13210086, 14017058, 16015270, and 17022026 to H.

The fact that the retina contains both non-spiking and spiking neurons leads us to frame questions about neural coding in a general fashion, rather than in a manner specific either to point processes or continuous signals. In particular, we ask about the role of the statistical structure of the response, the extent to which the neural representation is 'literal', and how information content can be estimated from laboratory data. The broad theme that emerges from a review of experimental data is that each stage of visual processing is accompanied by new features, including adaptive filtering, feedback, rectification and spike generation. These dynamical elements allow an increasingly rich set of strategies for the representation and processing of visual information at retinal and thalamic levels.","Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10021 USA","Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine","Victor, JD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Weill Med Coll, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.","jdvicto@med.cornell.edu","Victor, Jonathan D./D-2931-2009","Victor, Jonathan D./0000-0002-9293-0111",,,,,430,47,48,0,16,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","0954-898X","1361-6536",,"NETWORK-COMP NEURAL","Netw.-Comput.

Yet, the forebrain pathway that processes auditory spatial information is not known for any species. Using standard anatomic labeling techniques, we used a top-down approach to trace the flow of auditory spatial information from an output area of the forebrain sound localization pathway (the auditory archistriatum, AAr), back through the fore brain, and into the auditory midbrain. Previous work has demonstrated that AAr units are specialized for auditory space processing. The results presented here show that the AAr receives afferent input from Field L both directly and indirectly via the caudolateral neostriatum. Afferent input to Field L originates mainly in the auditory thalamus, nucleus ovoidalis, which, in turn, receives input from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we confirmed previously reported projections of the AAr to the basal ganglia, the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX), the deep layers of the optic tectum, and various brain stem nuclei. A series of inactivation experiments demonstrated that the sharp tuning of AAr sites for binaural spatial cues depends on field L input but not on input from the auditory space map in the midbrain ICX: pharmacological inactivation of Field L eliminated completely auditory responses in the AAr, whereas bilateral ablation of the midbrain ICX had no appreciable effect on AAr responses. We conclude, therefore, that the forebrain sound localization pathway can process auditory spatial information independently of the midbrain localization pathway.","Stanford Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Stanford University","Cohen, YE (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Biol, 216-76, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [R01-DC-00155] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))",,,72,41,41,0,3,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

We studied the nature of the modulatory effects of SRF stimulation with respect to stimulus contrast in cat V1. In 51 V1 neurons studied, large SRF stimuli (40 degrees x 30 degrees) induced only the suppression of responses to CRF stimulation and the suppressive effects became stronger as the contrast for SRF stimulation increased. The contrast sensitivity of SRF suppression did not correlate with that of CRF responses. By independently controlling contrast of CRF and SRF stimuli, we studied whether SRF effects vary with CRF response magnitude. Increasing contrast for CRF stimulation caused an upward shift of the range of effective contrasts for SRF stimulation, indicating that a high contrast for SRF stimulation is required for suppressing strong responses to CRF stimulation at high contrasts. To assess the possible origin of the suppressive SRF effect on V1 neurons, we also investigated the contrast dependency of SRF effects in 28 neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results suggest that SRF effects obtained at the subcortical level strongly contribute to those in V1. Taken together, we conclude that along the thalamocortical projections, SRF modulation exhibits a gain-control mechanism that scales the suppressive SRF effect depending on the contrast for CRF stimulation.

In most experiments, portions of auditory cortex were first explored with microelectrodes, neurons were characterized as responsive or not to auditory stimuli, and best frequencies were determined whenever possible. Most recordings were in cortex previously designated as primary (A-I) and rostral (R) auditory fields (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 171:111, '77) and in a newly defined rostrotemporal field (RT) located rostral to R. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent tracers were placed in electrophysiologically identified locations of A-1, R, and RT; the posterolateral (PL) and anterolateral (AL) divisions of a narrow belt of auditory cortex lateral and adjacent to A-I and R; cortex of the superior temporal gyrus lateral and rostrolateral to PL and AL; and regions of prefrontal cortex that receive inputs from auditory cortex. There were several major findings: 1. Best frequencies were most clearly determined for neurons within a densely myelinated strip of cortex on the lower bank and lip of the lateral sulcus. We divided this strip into three fields, A-I, R, and RT, although an alternative interpretation that A-1 and R are parts of a single field remains tenable. In some cases, isofrequency contours appeared to continue uninterrupted across fields A-I and R, with lower frequencies represented laterally and higher frequencies represented deeper in the sulcus. In other cases, there was a tendency for high frequencies to be represented caudally and medially, and low frequencies laterally in A-1 and rostrally in R, with partial discontinuity in the isofrequency contours. A reversal of the tonotopic gradient appeared in RT with a common low-frequency representation at the caudal border with R, and progressively higher frequencies encountered rostrally. Of the three fields, A-I appears slightly more myelinated than R, and RT slightly less than R. The distinctiveness of the three fields is further demonstrated by the patterns of connections. In particular, A-I and RT are both interconnected with R, but not with each other. Connections between A-1 and R are between tonotopically matched locations. 2. A narrow 2-3 mm wide band of cortex lateral to A-I, R, and RT was also responsive to auditory stimuli, but typically neurons were more difficult to activate, and best frequencies were more difficult to determine. No distinctions in myeloarchitecture or CO activity were obvious. Nevertheless, regions roughly corresponding to previously distinguished PL and AL divisions of the belt cortex (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 17 1:111, '77) were interconnected. Both PL and AL were connected with R, but PL was connected with A-I while AL was connected with RT. We also denoted a lateral rostrotemporal zone lateral to RT, with inputs from R, RT, and cortex rostral to RT. 3. Another proposed subdivision is CM, a moderately myelinated area medial to A-I that is somewhat smaller than the CM of Imig et al. ('77). CM has connections with A-I, R, PL, and AL. Other parts of the caudal, medial, and rostral belt cortex have auditory connections either from the core areas or other parts of the belt, so that overall there appear to be seven or more fields, but the exact number and boundaries remain uncertain. 4. Patterns of connections also implicate cortex lateral and laterorostral to the belt in auditory function. Cortex lateral to PL interconnects with PL and cortex lateral to AL, and this cortex and the cortex lateral and rostral to the belt have inputs from the auditory thalamus. 5. PL, AL and cortex lateral to these fields connect with cortex rostromedial to the frontal eye field. A-I, R, and RT do not directly connect with prefrontal cortex. 6. In the thalamus, the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex (MGV) projects to A-I, R, RT, and possibly weakly to PL and AL. The projections to different tonotopic locations in A-I and R suggest that low frequencies are represented caudoventrally and high frequencies rostrodorsally in MGV. The medial or magnocellular division (MGM) has more widespread projections to auditory cortex, including A-I, R, AL, and the lateral rostral temporal area (LRT). Although less precise than those of MGV, projections to A-I from MGM tend to be topographically organized with neurons projecting to high-frequency targets distributed dorsal to neurons projecting to low-frequency targets. The dorsal division, MGD, projects to R, RT, AL, and LRT, with more rostral fields receiving projections from the more caudal regions of MGD. The suprageniculate and limitans nuclei, as well as the medial pulvinar, also contribute to auditory fields outside the core areas A-I, R, and RT. 7. A-I, R, and RT project to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CN), with A-I projections extending into the laminated portion of the CN. Other parts of the auditory cortex, including AL and rostrolateral temporal cortex, project to the dorsal cortex (DC) and external nucleus (EN).",,,"MOREL, A (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240, USA.",,,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [NIDCD-00922] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-16446] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,85,173,175,0,2,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

While some of these adjustments occur at specific stages, others may be inherited from earlier stages. How do adaptation effects cascade along the visual system? We measured spatially selective adaptation at two successive stages in the mouse visual system: visual thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). This form of adaptation affected both stages but in drastically different ways: in LGN it only changed response gain, while in V1 it also shifted spatial tuning away from the adaptor. These effects, however, are reconciled by a simple model whereby V1 neurons summate LGN inputs with a fixed, unadaptable weighting profile. These results indicate that adaptation effects cascade through the visual system, that this cascading can shape selectivity, and that the rules of integration from one stage to the next are not themselves adaptable.","[Dhruv, Neel T.; Carandini, Matteo] UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England","University of London; University College London","Dhruv, NT (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.","n.dhruv@ucl.ac.uk","Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021; Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008","Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Dhruv, Neel/0000-0001-7112-8501","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship; National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship; Wellcome Trust; European Research Council","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship(Royal Society); National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC))","We thank Charu Reddy for outstanding technical support and Jeremy Freeman and Jonathan Pillow for providing code to fit the LNP model.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 70 mu m sections from FTLD-TDP autopsy cases (n = 39) presenting with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Two main types of cortical pTDP-43 pathology emerged, characterized by either predominantly perikaryal pTDP-43 inclusions (cytoplasmic type, cFTLD) or long aggregates in dendrites (neuritic type, nFTLD). Cortical involvement in nFTLD was extensive and frequently reached occipital areas, whereas cases with cFTLD often involved bulbar somatomotor neurons and the spinal cord. We observed four patterns indicative of potentially sequential dissemination of pTDP-43: cases with the lowest burden of pathology (pattern I) were characterized by widespread pTDP-43 lesions in the orbital gyri, gyrus rectus, and amygdala. With increasing burden of pathology (pattern II) pTDP-43 lesions emerged in the middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in anteromedial temporal lobe areas, the superior and medial temporal gyri, striatum, red nucleus, thalamus, and precerebellar nuclei. More advanced cases showed a third pattern (III) with involvement of the motor cortex, bulbar somatomotor neurons, and the spinal cord anterior horn, whereas cases with the highest burden of pathology (pattern IV) were characterized by pTDP-43 lesions in the visual cortex. We interpret the four neuropathological patterns in bvFTD to be consistent with the hypothesis that pTDP-43 pathology can spread sequentially and may propagate along axonal pathways.","[Brettschneider, Johannes; Irwin, David J.; Robinson, John L.; Toledo, Jon B.; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.; Lee, Virginia M. -Y.; Trojanowski, John Q.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, CNDR, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Brettschneider, Johannes; Del Tredici, Kelly; Fang, Lubin; Braak, Heiko] Univ Ulm, Dept Neurol, Ctr Biomed Res, Clin Neuroanat Sect, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Irwin, David J.; Grossman, Murray] Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.; Lee, Virginia M. -Y.; Trojanowski, John Q.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ludolph, Albert C.] Univ Ulm, Dept Neurol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Ulm University; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Ulm University","Brettschneider, J (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, CNDR, 3rd Floor Maloney Bldg,3600 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","johannes.brettschneider@uni-ulm.de; trojanow@upenn.edu","Van Deerlin, Vivianna/IYS-8157-2023; Del Tredici, Kelly/AAT-1286-2020","Del Tredici, Kelly/0000-0002-9130-7838; Toledo, Jon/0000-0003-4366-9268; Irwin, David/0000-0002-5599-5098","NIH [AG033101, AG017586, AG010124, AG032953, AG039510, NS044266]; Wyncote Foundation; Koller Family Foundation; German BMBF FTLD Consortium;  [T32-AG000255]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Wyncote Foundation; Koller Family Foundation; German BMBF FTLD Consortium; ","We thank the many patients who contributed to this study.

Understanding these communicative signals and integrating them into a common percept is paramount to successful social behaviour. While many previous studies have focused on the neurobiology of emotional communication in the auditory or visual modality alone, far less is known about multimodal integration of auditory and visual non-verbal emotional information. The present study investigated this process using event-related fMRI. Behavioural data revealed that audiovisual presentation of non-verbal emotional information resulted in a significant increase in correctly classified stimuli when compared with visual and auditory stimulation. This behavioural gain was paralleled by enhanced activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and right thalamus, when contrasting audiovisual to auditory and visual conditions. Further, a characteristic of these brain regions, substantiating their role in the emotional integration process, is a linear relationship between the gain in classification accuracy and the strength of the BOLD response during the bimodal condition. Additionally, enhanced effective connectivity between audiovisual integration areas and associative auditory and visual cortices was observed during audiovisual stimulation, offering further insight into the neural process accomplishing multimodal integration. Finally, we were able to document an enhanced sensitivity of the putative integration sites to stimuli with emotional non-verbal content as compared to neutral stimuli. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While the phenomenon of functional cortical reorganization is well established, it remains unknown whether in humans, functional reorganization results from changes in brain anatomy, or simply reflects an unmasking of already existing dormant synapses. In 20 subjects with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and 23 controls, we used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether SI reorganization was associated with changes in SI anatomy. SCI resulted in a significant SI reorganization, with the little finger representation moving medially toward the lower body representation (i.e., area of sensory loss). Furthermore, although SCI was associated with gray matter volume loss in the lower body representation, this loss was minimized as reorganization increased. That is, the greater the medial shift in little finger representation, the greater the gray matter preservation in the lower body representation. In addition, in the region of greatest SI reorganization (little finger), fractional anisotropy was correlated with SI reorganization. That is, as SI reorganization increased, the extent of aligned structures decreased. Finally, although thalamocortical fibers remained unchanged, the ease and direction of water movement within the little finger representation was altered, being directed more toward the midline in SCI subjects. These data show that SI reorganization following SCI is associated with changes in SI anatomy and provide compelling evidence that SI reorganization in humans results from the growth of new lateral connections, and not simply from the unmasking of already existing lateral connections.","[Henderson, Luke A.; Gustin, Sylvia M.] Univ Sydney, Dept Anat & Histol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Gustin, Sylvia M.; Wrigley, Paul J.; Siddall, Philip J.] Univ Sydney, Royal N Shore Hosp, Div Kolling Inst Med Res, Pain Management Res Inst, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Macey, Paul M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","University of Sydney; Royal North Shore Hospital; University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Henderson, LA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Anat & Histol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","lukeh@anatomy.usyd.edu.au","Wrigley, Paul J/P-9048-2014; Gustin, Sylvia M/H-9648-2018; Macey, Paul M./B-5037-2008","Wrigley, Paul J/0000-0003-0960-4102; Gustin, Sylvia M/0000-0002-9613-9845; Macey, Paul M./0000-0003-4093-7458; Henderson, Luke/0000-0002-1026-0151","New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research","New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research","This work was supported by grants awarded by the New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research.

The time-course and sensitivity of excitatory postsynaptic potentials to current injected at the soma, and locations of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites, indicated that the majority of contributory synapses were located in layer V. Within a column of tissue, radius less than or equal to 250 mu m, the probability that a randomly selected layer III pyramid innervated a layer V pyramid was I in 4 if the target cell was a burst firing pyramid with an apical dendritic tuft in layers II/I. If, however, the potential target was a regular spiking pyramid, the probability of connectivity was only 1 in 40, and none of the 13 anatomically identified postsynaptic layer V targets had a slender apical dendrite terminating in layers IV/III. Morphological reconstructions indicated that layer III pyramids select target layer V cells whose apical dendrites pass within 50-100 mu m of the soma of the presynaptic pyramid in layer III and which have overlapping apical dendritic tufts in the superficial layers. The probability that a layer V cell would innervate a layer III pyramid lying within 250 mu m of its apical dendrite was much lower (one in 58). Both presynaptic layer III pyramids and their large postsynaptic layer V targets could therefore access similar inputs in layers I/II, while small layer V pyramids could not. One prediction from the present data would be that neither descending layer V inputs to the striatum or thalamus, nor transcallosal connections would be readily activated by longer distance cortico-cortical feedback connections that terminated in layers I/II. These could, however, activate corticofugal pathways to the superior colliculus or pens, both directly and via layer III. (C) 1998 IBRO.

Likewise, during natural tactile behaviors, spatially extensive regions of the somatosensory surface are co-activated. The large spatial extent of naturalistic stimulation means that surround suppression, a phenomenon whose neural mechanisms remain a matter of debate, must arise during natural behavior. To identify common neural motifs that might instantiate surround suppression across modalities, we review models of surround suppression and compare the evidence supporting the competing ideas that surround suppression has either cortical or subcortical origins in visual and barrel cortex. In the visual system there is general agreement lateral inhibitory mechanisms contribute to surround suppression, but little direct experimental evidence that intracortical inhibition plays a major role. Two intracellular recording studies of V1, one using naturalistic stimuli (Haider et al., 2010), the other sinusoidal gratings (Ozeki et al., 2009), sought to identify the causes of reduced activity in V1 with increasing stimulus size, a hallmark of surround suppression. The former attributed this effect to increased inhibition, the latter to largely balanced withdrawal of excitation and inhibition. In rodent primary somatosensory barrel cortex, multi-whisker responses are generally weaker than single whisker responses, suggesting multi-whisker stimulation engages similar surround suppressive mechanisms. The origins of suppression in S1 remain elusive: studies have implicated brainstem lateral/internuclear interactions and both thalamic and cortical inhibition. Although the anatomical organization and instantiation of surround suppression in the visual and somatosensory systems differ, we consider the idea that one common function of surround suppression, in both modalities, is to remove the statistical redundancies associated with natural stimuli by increasing the sparsenessor selectivity of sensory responses.","[Sachdev, Robert N.

While some studies - especially those employing functional magnetic resonance imaging - imply that this is the case, others - particularly those recording from single neurons - suggest that it is not. In the light of this ongoing controversy, it is surprising that the analogous question in other sensory modalities has received far less attention. The first part of the present article reviews studies relevant to the role of primary auditory and primary somatosensory cortices in conscious auditory and tactile experience. As will become evident, the results of these studies, at least at first sight, appear no less contradictory than those obtained in the visual modality - in fact, they evidence discrepancies that resemble those found in the visual system to an impressive degree. The second part of the article attempts to reconcile the seemingly contradictory data by suggesting that only activity induced in the primary sensory cortices through cortico-cortical top-down signals can become consciously accessible, whereas activity induced by bottom-up signals from the thalamus cannot. This conclusion is in line with the earlier proposals of several prominent neuroscientists that portrayed conscious perception as the result of an active interpretative process by the brain, rather than a passive reflection of the environment.

A key feature of the LGN is the segregation of retinal inputs into different cellular layers characterized by their differential responses to red-green (RG) color (L/M opponent), blue-yellow (BY) color (S-cone opponent) and achromatic (Ach) contrast. In this study we use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (4 tesla, 3.6 x 3.6 x 3 mm(3)) to record simultaneously the responses of the human LGN and V1 to chromatic and Ach contrast to investigate the LGN responses to color, and how these are modified as information transfers between LGN and cortex. We find that the LGN has a robust response to RG color contrast, equal to or greater than the Ach response, but a significantly poorer sensitivity to BY contrast. In V1 at low temporal rates (2 Hz), however, the sensitivity of the BY color pathway is selectively enhanced, rising in relation to the RG and Ach responses. We find that this effect generalizes across different stimulus contrasts and spatial stimuli (1-d and 2-d patterns), but is selective for temporal frequency, as it is not found for stimuli at 8 Hz. While the mechanism of this cortical enhancement of BY color vision and its dynamic component is unknown, its role may be to compensate for a weak BY signal originating from the sparse distribution of neurons in the retina and LGN.","[Mullen, Kathy T.; Dumoulin, Serge O.; Hess, Robert F.] McGill Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, McGill Vis Res, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Hess, Robert F.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Optometry, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia","McGill University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT)","Mullen, KT (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, McGill Vis Res, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.","kathy.mullen@mcgill.ca","Hess, Robert F/A-5624-2008; Mullen, Kathy T/A-5401-2008; Dumoulin, Serge O/A-3603-2012","Dumoulin, Serge O/0000-0001-7474-7711","CIHR [MOP-53346, MOP-10819]; Department of Optometry, Queensland University of Technology","CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Department of Optometry, Queensland University of Technology","We thank all our subjects, and Katie McMahon, Matt Meredith, Martina Bryant and Andrew Janke for technical support.

Voxelbased morphometry (VBM) was applied to magnetic resonance images of strabismic adults to detect any abnormal brain anatomy, which could not be easily identified by simple inspection. The gray matter volume in strabismic adults was smaller than that in normal subjects at the areas consistent with the occipital eye field (OEF) and parietal eye field (PEF). However, greater gray matter volume was found in strabismic adults relative to normal controls at the areas consistent with the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and subcortical regions such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. These opposite gray matter changes in the visual and the oculomotor processing areas are compatible with a hypothesis of plasticity in the oculomotor regions to compensate for the cortical deficits in the visual processing areas.

To what extent these interactions are present in the human brain remains unclear; however, these connections are thought to provide an important framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to the manifestation of basal ganglia disorders, especially with respect to tremor genesis in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested the feasibility of assessing these connections in vivo and non-invasively in the human brain with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography. After developing a standardized protocol for manual segmentation of basal ganglia and cerebellar structures, masks for diffusion tractography were defined based on structural magnetic resonance images. We tested intra- and inter-observer stability and carried out tractography for dentato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar projections. After robustly achieving connection probabilities per tract, the connectivity values and connectional fingerprints were calculated in a group of healthy volunteers. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was applicable to probe the inter-connection of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Our data confirmed that dentato-thalamo-striato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar connections also exist in the human brain at a level similar to those that were recently suggested by transneuronal tracing studies in non-human primates. Standardized segmentation protocols made these findings reproducible with high stability. We have demonstrated that diffusion tractography in humans in vivo is capable of revealing the structural bases of cerebellar networks with the basal ganglia. These findings support the role of the cerebellum as a satellite system of established cortico-basal ganglia networks in humans.","[Pelzer, Esther Annegret; Hintzen, Andreas; Goldau, Mathias; von Cramon, Detlev Yves; Tittgemeyer, Marc] Max Planck Inst Neurol Res, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Pelzer, Esther Annegret; Timmermann, Lars] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Neurol, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Goldau, Mathias] Univ Leipzig, Inst Informat, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany","Max Planck Society; University of Cologne; Leipzig University","Pelzer, EA (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Neurol, Kerpener Str 62, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.","esther.pelzer@uk-koeln.de",,"Timmermann, Lars/0000-0002-5301-3580","German Research Foundation (DFG) in the Clinical Research Group 219 [KFO 219]","German Research Foundation (DFG) in the Clinical Research Group 219(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors wish to thank Jurgen K.

Thus, the link between structure and function has rarely been explicitly established, remaining a well-known controversial issue.

The axonal input to the triads, however, was found to be of three different types: (1) the majority were retinal axon terminals; (2) a smaller fraction were the axonal endings of corticogeniculate fibers, always connected to thin, distal P-cell dendrites; (3) others were terminals with pleomorphic or flattened, small synaptic vesicles, probably belonging to axons of I-cells and/or of thalamic reticular nucleus origin. It was observed also that the retinal terminals established multiple synaptic contacts with both P-cell and I-cell dendrites. Essentially, two types of triadic arrangements with retinal input were recognized: the simple unit, frequent in parvicellular laminae, in which the retinal axon was accompanied by only 1-2 presynaptic dendrites; and the complex unit, found mostly in the magnocellular laminae, characterized by the presence of up to eight presynaptic dendrites. In the glomerular complex units, closely packed classical triads, with the three synaptic junctions localized close to each other, coexisted with triads at a distance where the synapses were distributed relatively far from each other. The coupling by presynaptic dendrites of closely-packed and at a distance triads resulted in the formation of multiple triadic arrangements. Since cortical and inhibitory triads were never seen to be involved in multiple triadic complexes, the latter appeared exclusively retinal in nature. The possible functional significance of multiple triads in ON-gating operation is briefly discussed.","CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, 1 GUSTAVE LEVY PL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; SEMMELWEIS UNIV MED, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT 1, H-1450 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY; SEMMELWEIS UNIV MED, DEPT CELL BIOL & ANAT, H-1450 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Semmelweis University; Semmelweis University","PASIK, P (corresponding author), CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, 1 GUSTAVE LEVY PL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA.",,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY-01867] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-22953, NS-11631] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,46,10,11,0,1,"AKAD VERLAG GMBH","BERLIN","PALISADENSTR 40, D-10243 BERLIN, GERMANY","0021-8359",,,"J HIRNFORSCH",,,1991,32,3,,,,,369,379,,,,,,11,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","GU796",1779135,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1991GU79600008","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1991GU79600008"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We analysed CT/MRI and single photon emission tomography (SPET) findings from 37 patients studied in the chronic phase of stroke (mean duration+/-SD=3.6+/-1.6 months), whom we were able to follow clinically for a period of 3 months. The eventual degree of motor recovery correlated significantly (negatively) with the rime since stroke at entry, but nor with the severity of neurological impairment at entry. The volume side and location (cortical or subcortical) of the infarct did not correlate with either the severity or the evolution of the motor deficit Patients with a CT/MRI lesion of the parietal lobe (n = 8) showed a more severe motor deficit than those with other cortical locations. The severity of the motor deficit correlated significantly (negatively) with CBF values in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal areas of the damaged hemisphere, and in the contralateral undamaged primary motor cortex. The degree of motor improvement correlated significantly (positively) with CBF values in the contralateral undamaged thalamus, lentiform and caudate nuclei, and premotor cortex. In the late phase of stroke, the severity of the motor deficit may be positively associated with the functional impairment of associative parietal and frontal areas of the damaged hemisphere. The functional impairment of the basal ganglia-frontal network in the undamaged hemisphere seems to be related to a pool; delayed motor recovery.","IRCCS SANTA LUCIA,ROME,ITALY; IST MEDITERRANEO NEUROSCI SANATRIX,POZZILLI,IS,ITALY","IRCCS Santa Lucia","Pantano, P (corresponding author), UNIV ROMA LA SAPIENZA,DEPT NEUROL SCI,VIALE UNIV 30,I-00185 ROME,ITALY.",,"Sabatini, Umberto/A-8484-2010; Patrizia, Pantano/C-8214-2009; Sabatini, Umberto/K-4659-2016; Di Piero, Vittorio/U-7714-2019; di piero, vittorio/F-6335-2010","Patrizia, Pantano/0000-0001-9659-8294; Sabatini, Umberto/0000-0001-5321-8626; di piero, vittorio/0000-0002-2631-7562",,,,,52,85,94,0,7,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0006-8950",,,"BRAIN","Brain","DEC",1996,119,,6,,,,1849,1857,,"10.1093/brain/119.6.1849","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/119.6.1849"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/119.6.1849"")",,,9,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","WE280",9009992,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1996WE28000003","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1996WE28000003"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The psychological competences are: Language development, a sense of right and wrong, self-awareness, and the ability to make inferences, The accompanying changes in the brain involve the prefrontal cortex, language-related cortical areas, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and an increase in the connectivity of the network. Of special interest are the maturational changes in layers III-IV of the prefrontal cortex. Layer III is the origin and target of callosal and commissural axons linking the two hemispheres and the target of associational axons linking ipsilateral areas within each hemisphere. Layer IV, the target for axons from the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, conveys information from other associational cortices, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and the reticular and limbic systems. In the second year, intensive dendritic growth and synaptogenesis in these layers increase the linking of these two layers and form a neural basis for a more efficient convergence and integration of information from the two hemispheres, which are functionally asymmetric. It is our hypothesis that these changes, together with the maturational changes in the cortico-subcortical network, are a basis for the observed emergence of the psychological competences. We are aware that temporal correlations cannot prove firm causal relationships. However, knowledge of these correlations is useful in generating specific hypotheses that can be tested directly.","Univ Bern, Dept Pediat, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Dusseldorf, Vogt Inst Hirnforsch, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany; Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Med, Julich, Germany","University of Bern; Harvard University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich","Herschkowitz, N (corresponding author), Pourtalesstr 57, CH-3074 Muri Bern, Switzerland.",,"Zilles, Karl/Y-3784-2019; Zilles, Karl/J-9704-2013","Zilles, Karl/0000-0002-4705-4175; Zilles, Karl/0000-0001-9296-9959",,,,,144,26,26,1,4,"GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG","STUTTGART","RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY","0174-304X","1439-1899",,"NEUROPEDIATRICS","Neuropediatrics","OCT",1999,30,5,,,,,221,230,,"10.1055/s-2007-973495","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-973495"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-973495"")",,,10,"Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Pediatrics","262UQ",10598832,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000084085200001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000084085200001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The functional interactions between brain areas, including those observed during rest, are assumed to stem from the collective influence of action potentials carried by long-range neural projections. However, the contribution of individual neurons to brain-wide functional connectivity has not been systematically assessed. Here we developed a method to concurrently measure and compare the spiking activity of local neurons with fMRI signals measured across the brain during rest. We recorded spontaneous activity from neural populations in cortical face patches in the macaque during fMRI scanning sessions. Individual cells exhibited prominent, bilateral coupling with fMRI fluctuations in a restricted set of cortical areas inside and outside the face patch network, partially matching the pattern of known anatomical projections. Within each face patch population, a subset of neurons was positively coupled with the face patch network and another was negatively coupled. The same cells showed inverse correlations with distinct subcortical structures, most notably the lateral geniculate nucleus and brainstem neuromodulatory centers. Corresponding connectivity maps derived from fMRI seeds and local field potentials differed from the single unit maps, particularly in subcortical areas. Together, the results demonstrate that the spiking fluctuations of neurons are selectively coupled with discrete brain regions, with the coupling governed in part by anatomical network connections and in part by indirect neuromodulatory pathways.","[Zaldivar, Daniel; Koyano, Kenji W.; Godlove, David C.; Park, Soo Hyun; Russ, Brian E.; Bhik-Ghanie, Rebecca; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)","Zaldivar, D; Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","daniel.zaldivarperez@nih.gov; leopoldd@mail.nih.gov","Zaldivar, Daniel/M-6729-2014; Koyano, Kenji/IQU-4144-2023","Zaldivar, Daniel/0000-0002-6838-355X; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360; Bhik-Ghanie, Rebecca/0000-0002-4262-7165; Koyano, Kenji/0000-0002-2160-1732; Park, Soo Hyun/0000-0003-4645-457X","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health [ZIAMH002838, ZIAMH002898, ZIAMH002899]; DFG [ZA990/1-]","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank David Yu, Charles Zhu, and Katy Smith for their assistance during experiments.

Concurrent stimulation of many patches by means of the pseudorandom, binary m-sequence technique revealed interactions between their respective responses. An analysis identified two distinct components of local field potentials: a fast local component (FLC) and a slow distributed component (SDC). The FLC is thought to be a primarily postsynaptic response, as judged by its relatively short latency. It is directly generated by thalamocortical volleys following retinotopic stimulation of receptive fields of a small cluster of single cells, combined with responses to recurrent excitation and inhibition derived from the cells under study and immediately neighboring cells. In contrast, the SDC is thought to be an aggregate of dendritic potentials related to the long-range lateral connections (i.e. long-range coupling). We compared the suppressive effects of a GABA(A)-receptor agonist, muscimol, on the FLC and SDC with those of a GABA(B)-receptor agonist, baclofen, and found that muscimol more strongly suppressed the FLC than the SDC, and that the reverse was the case for baclofen. The differential suppression of the FLC and SDC found in the present study is consistent with the notion that intracortical electrical signals related to the FLC terminate on the somata and proximal/basal dendrites, while those related to the SDC terminate on distal dendrites.","Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA","The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute","Kasamatsu, T (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 2318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.","takuji@ski.org",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY-06883, EY-012413, EY-06861] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,73,10,10,0,2,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0952-5238","1469-8714",,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","NOV-DEC",2005,22,6,,,,,839,858,,"10.1017/S0952523805226135","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523805226135"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523805226135"")",,,20,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","013FY",16469192,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000235396400012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000235396400012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In this present cross-sectional study, we aimed to search for neural networks with electroencephalography whose frequency-specific actions may predict bradykinesia. Methods: Twenty Parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation were first prescreened while we selected four levels of contralateral stimulation (0: OFF, 1-3: decreasing symptoms to ON state) individually, based on kinematics. In the screening period, we performed 64-channel electroencephalography measurements simultaneously with electromyography and motion detection during a resting state, finger tapping, hand grasping tasks, and pronation-supination of the arm, with the four levels of contralateral stimulation. We analyzed spectral power at the low (13-20 Hz) and high (21-30 Hz) beta frequency bands and low (31-60 Hz) and high (61-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands using the dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Structural equation modelling estimated causal relationships between the slope of changes in network beta and gamma activities and the slope of changes in bradykinesia measures. Results: Activity in different subnetworks, including predominantly the primary motor and premotor cortex, the subthalamic nucleus predicted the slopes in amplitude and speed while switching between stimulation levels. These subnetwork dynamics on their preferred frequencies predicted distinct types and parameters of the movement only on the contralateral side. Discussion: Concurrent subnetworks affected in bradykinesia and their activity changes in the different frequency bands are specific to the type and parameters of the movement; and the primary motor and premotor cortex are common nodes.","[Muthuraman, Muthuraman; Koirala, Nabin] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Biomed Stat & Multimodal Signal Proc, Movement Disorders Imaging & Neurostimulat,Univ M, Mainz, Germany; [Palotai, Marcell; Javor-Duray, Borbala; Kelemen, Andrea; Tamas, Gertrud] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Neurol, Balassa Utca 6, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Koirala, Nabin] Haskins Labs Inc, New Haven, CT USA; [Halasz, Laszlo; Eross, Lorand] Natl Inst Clin Neurosci, Budapest, Hungary; [Fekete, Gabor; Bognar, Laszlo] Univ Debrecen, Dept Neurosurg, Debrecen, Hungary; [Deuschl, Gunther] Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, Kiel, Germany","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Semmelweis University; Yale University; Haskins Laboratories; University of Debrecen; University of Kiel","Tamas, G (corresponding author), Semmelweis Univ, Dept Neurol, Balassa Utca 6, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.","tamas.gertrud@med.semmelweis-univ.hu","Koirala, Nabin/Y-3055-2019; Deuschl, Gunther/A-7986-2010; Muthuraman, Muthuraman/ABD-2021-2020","Koirala, Nabin/0000-0002-8261-8271; Deuschl, Gunther/0000-0002-4176-9196; Muthuraman, Muthuraman/0000-0001-6158-2663; Tamas, Gertrud/0000-0001-8054-3678; Eross, Lorand/0000-0002-5796-5546","Medtronic plc.

Auditory information is then distributed from the core areas to a surrounding belt of about seven areas that are less precisely cochleotopic and generally more responsive to complex stimuli than tones. Recent studies indicate that the belt areas relay to the rostral and caudal divisions of a parabelt region at a third level of processing in the cortex lateral to the belt. The parabelt and belt regions have additional inputs from dorsal and magnocellular divisions of the medial geniculate complex and other parts of the thalamus. The belt and parabelt regions appear to be concerned with integrative and associative functions involved in pattern perception and object recognition. The parabelt fields connect with regions of temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex that mediate additional auditory functions, including space perception and auditory memory.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Vanderbilt University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Kaas, JH (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.","jon.h.kaas@vanderbilt.edu; troy.a.hackett@vanderbilt.edu; mtramo@hms.harvard.edu",,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC 03382, DC 00249] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 16446] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,82,279,284,1,24,"CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD","LONDON","84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND","0959-4388","1873-6882",,"CURR OPIN NEUROBIOL","Curr.

To assess the input mechanism underlying the surround suppression, we tested the effects of iontophoretically administered GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), for the 46 V1 neurons in anesthetized cats. First, the stimulus-size tuning curves were studied, with or without BMI administration, for each neuron by changing the size of the grating patch. During the BMI administration, the shape of the normalized size tuning curve did not change considerably. Second, the dependency of surround suppression on the orientation of the surround grating was examined. In the control, the surround suppression showed the clear orientation tuning that peaked at an orientation the same as the optimal orientation of the CRF response. The BMI administration did not change the orientation dependency of surround suppression. We also estimated the relative contribution of excitation and inhibition to the size and orientation tuning of surround suppression. It was concluded that cortical excitation and inhibition were well balanced, having similar tuning profiles for both stimulus size and orientation of the surround grating. Furthermore, surround stimuli used for V1 neurons suppressed the CRF response of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that surround suppression is not primarily attributable to the intracortical inhibition, but because of a reduction of thalamocortical inputs, which drive the cortical excitation and inhibition, and a subsequent decrease in the cortical excitatory interactions.","Osaka Univ, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan","Osaka University","Sato, H (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, 1-17 Machikaneyama, Osaka 5600043, Japan.","sato@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp","Naito, Tomoyuki/AAV-4785-2021",,,,,,55,115,117,0,4,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

However, a largely unexplored area is the nature and existence of cross-modal structural-functional relationships, in which, for example, the volume (or other morphological property) of one brain region is related to the functional response to a given task either in that same brain region, or another brain region. The present study investigated whether the gray matter volume of a selected group of structures (superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, thalamus, and hippocampus) was correlated with the fMRI response to a working memory task, within a mask of regions previously identified as involved with working memory. The subjects included individuals with schizophrenia, their siblings, and healthy controls (n = 154 total). Using rigorous permutation testing to define the null distribution, we found that the volume of the superior and middle frontal gyri was correlated with working memory activity within clusters in the intraparietal sulcus (i.e., dorsal parietal cortex) and that the volume of the hippocampus was correlated with working memory activity within clusters in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus. However, we did not find evidence that the identified structure-function relationships differed between subject groups. These results show that long-distance structural-functional relationships exist within the human brain. The study of such cross-modal relationships represents an additional approach for studying systems-level interregional brain networks.","[Harms, Michael P.; Barch, Deanna M.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Wang, Lei; Csernansky, John G.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Barch, Deanna M.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL); Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Washington University (WUSTL)","Harms, MP (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Box 8134,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","mharms@conte.wustl.edu","wang, le/HKN-3406-2023; Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013; Barch, Deanna M/G-8638-2013","Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388; Harms, Michael/0000-0001-7945-036X","National Institute of Mental Health [MH071616, MH056584]; National Center for Research Resources [RR015241]","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR))","We thank the staff of the Administration/Assessment Core of the CCNMD at Washington University School of Medicine for collection of the clinical and imaging data.

Using positron emission tomography (PET), we recently showed that the activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (midcingulate area 24a') covaries with the hypnosis-induced reduction of affective and sensory responses to noxious thermal stimulation [Faymonville et al., Anesthesiology 92 (2000) 1257-1267]. In the present study, we assessed changes in cerebral functional connectivity related to the hypnotic state, compared to simple distraction and the resting state. Nineteen highly hypnotizable right-handed volunteers were studied using (H2O)-O-15-PET. The experimental conditions were hot noxious or warm non-noxious stimulation of the right hand during resting state, mental imagery and hypnotic state. Using a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we identified brain areas that would respond to noxious stimulations under the modulatory action of the midcingulate cortex in, and only in, the hypnotic state. Hypnosis, compared to the resting state, reduced pain perception by 50%. Pain perception during rest and mental imagery was not significantly different. Analysis of PET data showed that the hypnotic state, compared to normal alertness (i.e., rest and mental imagery), significantly enhanced the functional modulation between midcingulate cortex and a large neural network encompassing bilateral insula, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, right prefrontal cortex and striatum, thalamus and brainstem. These findings point to a critical role for the midcingulate cortex in the modulation of a large cortical and subcortical network underlying its influence on sensory, affective, Cognitive and behavioral aspects of nociception, in the specific context of hypnosis.

Most of the injured stay in the emergency department for a few hours and are discharged home without a specific follow-up plan because of their negative clinical structural imaging. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly functional MRI (fMRI), has been reported as being sensitive to functional disturbances after brain injury. In this study, a cohort of 12 patients with mTBI were prospectively recruited from the emergency department of our local Level-1 trauma center for an advanced MRI scan at the acute stage. Sixteen age- and sex-matched controls were also recruited for comparison. Both group-based and individual-based independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) demonstrated reduced functional connectivity in both posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus regions in comparison with controls, which is part of the default mode network (DMN). Further seed-based analysis confirmed reduced functional connectivity in these two regions and also demonstrated increased connectivity between these regions and other regions of the brain in mTBI. Seed-based analysis using the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala regions further demonstrated increased functional connectivity between these regions and other regions of the brain, particularly in the frontal lobe, in mTBI. Our data demonstrate alterations of multiple brain networks at the resting state, particularly increased functional connectivity in the frontal lobe, in response to brain concussion at the acute stage. Resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN could serve as a potential biomarker for improved detection of mTBI in the acute setting.","[Iraji, Armin; Mika, Valerie; Haacke, E.

However, some patients can respond to visual stimuli presented in their lesion-affected visual field using residual visual pathways bypassing V1. This phenomenon is called blindsight. Many studies have tried to identify the brain regions responsible for blindsight, and the pulvinar and/or lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are suggested to play key roles as the thalamic relay of visual signals. However, there are critical problems regarding these preceding studies in that subjects with different sized lesions and periods of time after lesioning were investigated; furthermore, the ability of blindsight was assessed with different measures. In this study, we used double dissociation to clarify the roles of the pulvinar and LGN by pharmacological inactivation of each region and investigated the effects in a simple task with visually guided saccades (VGSs) using monkeys with a unilateral VI lesion, by which nearly all of the contralesional visual field was affected. Inactivating either the ipsilesional pulvinar or LGN impaired VGS toward a visual stimulus in the affected field. In contrast, inactivation of the contralesional pulvinar had no clear effect, but inactivation of the contralesional LGN impaired VGS to the intact visual field. These results suggest that the pulvinar and LGN play key roles in performing the simple VGS task after V1 lesioning, and that the visuomotor functions of blindsight monkeys were supported by plastic changes in the visual pathway involving the pulvinar, which emerged after V1 lesioning.","[Takakuwa, Norihiro; Isa, Kaoru; Onoe, Hirotaka; Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Takakuwa, Norihiro; Isa, Kaoru; Isa, Tadashi] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Onoe, Hirotaka; Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Human Brain Res Ctr, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Takahashi, Jun] Kyoto Univ, Ctr iPS Cell Res & Applicat, Dept Clin Applicat, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol WPI ASHBi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Takakuwa, Norihiro] Max Planck Inst Brain Res, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Kyoto University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Max Planck Society","Isa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;Isa, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.;Isa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Human Brain Res Ctr, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.;Isa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol WPI ASHBi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.","isa.tadashi.7u@kyoto-u.ac.jp",,"Isa, Tadashi/0000-0001-5652-4688; Isa, Kaoru/0000-0001-9254-5865","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology/Japan Science and Technology Agency [JPMJCR1651]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [19H05723, 26221003, 19H01011]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19H01011, 19H05723, 26221003] Funding Source: KAKEN","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology/Japan Science and Technology Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology/Japan Science and Technology Agency (Grant JPMJCR1651), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Kiban (S; Grant 26221003) and Kiban (A; Grant 19H01011) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Hyper-Adaptation (Grant No. 19H05723) from JSPS to T.I.

The afferent input to the nucleus will provide evidence as to its role in autonomic function. in the present study, we aimed to identify the detailed anatomical projections to the posterior hypothalamic nucleus from cortical, subcortical and brainstem structures, using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde axonal transport technique in the rat, Subsequent to the injection of HRP into the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, extensive cell labelling was observed bilaterally in various areas of the cerebral cortex including the cingulate, frontal, parietal and insular cortices. At subcortical levels: labelled cells were observed in the medial and lateral septal nuclei, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and various thalamic and amygdaloid nuclei. Also axons of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band were labelled and labelled cells were localised at the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus. The brainstem projections were from the medial, lateral and parasolitary nuclei, the intercalated nucleus of the medulla, the sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, and various reticular, vestibular, raphe and central rey nuclei. The posterior hypothalamic nucleus also received projections from the lateral and medial cerebellar nuclei and from upper cervical spinal levels.

Rats in the pseudorandom group were exposed to pseudorandom presentations of the same tone, light and shock stimuli without consistent pairings, Untrained rats in a naive group did not receive presentations of the experimental stimuli. The findings demonstrated that auditory fear conditioning modifies the metabolic neuronal responses of the auditory system, supporting the hypothesis that sensory neurons are responsive to behavioural stimulus properties acquired by learning. There was a clear distinction between thalamocortical and lower divisions of the auditory system based on the differences in metabolic activity evoked by classical conditioning, which lead to an overt learned behavioural response versus pseudorandom stimulus presentations, which lead to behavioural habituation. Increases in cytochrome oxidase activity indicated that tone processing is enhanced during associative conditioning at upper auditory structures (medial geniculate nucleus and secondary auditory cortices). In contrast, metabolic activation of lower auditory structures (cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculus) in response to the pseudorandom presentation of the experimental stimuli suggest that these areas may be activated during habituation to tone stimuli. Together these findings show that mapping the metabolic activity of cytochrome oxidase with quantitative histochemistry can be successfully used to map regional long-lasting effects of learning on brain systems.","Univ Texas, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas, Inst Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Gonzalez-Lima, F (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.","gonzalez-lima@psyvax.psy.utexas.edu",,"Gonzalez-Lima, Francisco/0000-0001-9856-0775","NIMH NIH HHS [T32 MH18837] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS37755] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,70,67,67,0,4,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Although the clinical symptoms are well characterized, the pathophysiology of this voice disorder is unknown. We describe here, for the first time to our knowledge, disorder-specific brain abnormalities in these patients as determined by a combined approach of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and postmortem histopathology. We used DTI to identify brain changes and to target those brain regions for neuropathological examination. DTI showed right-sided decrease of fractional anisotropy in the genu of the internal capsule and bilateral increase of overall water diffusivity in the white matter along the corticobulbar/ corticospinal tract in 20 spasmodic dysphonia patients compared to 20 healthy subjects. In addition, water diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the lentiform nucleus, ventral thalamus and cerebellar white and grey matter in the patients. These brain changes were substantiated with focal histopathological abnormalities presented as a loss of axonal density and myelin content in the right genu of the internal capsule and clusters of mineral depositions, containing calcium, phosphorus and iron, in the parenchyma and vessel walls of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, putamen, globus pallidus and cerebellum in the postmortem brain tissue from one patient compared to three controls. The specificity of these brain abnormalities is confirmed by their localization, limited only to the corticobulbar/ corticospinal tract and its main input/ output structures. We also found positive correlation between the diffusivity changes and clinical symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia ( r= 0.509, P= 0.037). These brain abnormalities may alter the central control of voluntary voice production and, therefore, may underlie the pathophysiology of this disorder.","[Simonyan, Kristina; Ludlow, Christy L.] NINDS, Med Neurol Branch, Laryngeal & Speech Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tovar-Moll, Fernanda] NINDS, Neuroimmunol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Ostuni, John] NINDS, Clin Neurosci Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Hallett, Mark] NINDS, Human Motor Control Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Kalasinsky, Victor F.; Lewin-Smith, Michael R.] NINDS, Dept Environm & Infect Dis Sci, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Rushing, Elisabeth J.] NINDS, Dept Neuropathol & Ophthalm Pathol, Armed Forces Inst Pathol, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Vortmeyer, Alexander O.] NINDS, Surg Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); United States Department of Defense; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)","Simonyan, K (corresponding author), NINDS, Med Neurol Branch, Laryngeal & Speech Sect, NIH, 10 Canc Dr,Bldg 10,Room 5D38, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","simonyak@ninds.nih.gov","Moll, Fernanda Tovar/N-3320-2018; Moll, Fernanda Tovar/AAF-8477-2021; Neurociencia, Inct/I-1011-2013; Simonyan, Kristina/E-2511-2016","Moll, Fernanda Tovar/0000-0002-0292-5985; Moll, Fernanda Tovar/0000-0002-0292-5985; Ludlow, Christy/0000-0002-2015-6171; Simonyan, Kristina/0000-0001-7444-0437","Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 NS002980-08, Z99 NS999999] Funding Source: Medline","Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)",,,86,93,95,0,9,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950",,,"BRAIN","Brain","FEB",2008,131,,2,,,,447,459,,"10.1093/brain/awm303","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awm303"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awm303"")",,,13,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","258XO",18083751,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000252903900016","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000252903900016"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

However, recent studies have emphasized that such ongoing activity is strongly synchronized over large cortical distances, and can have a marked impact on the responsiveness of neurons to visual stimuli, suggesting that such activity may indeed be highly relevant to the brain's interpretation of its sensory input. In the current study, we examined the spatiotemporal nature of local field potential (LFP) fluctuations in the visual cortex of two macaque monkeys that were awake, but in a state of relaxation with minimal visual stimulation. Using an array of 16 electrodes spaced by several millimeters, we simultaneously monitored the LFP at many sites over a large region of the visual cortex. In agreement with the literature, we found that the coherence in the raw LFP signal fell off quickly with both frequency and distance. However, when we examined slower fluctuations in the LFP power, we found that. power signals, including those derived from the high gamma-range frequencies, had high coherence that fell off only very slowly with cortical distance. Finally, we performed an additional experiment, with several electrodes placed on either side of a sulcus, to demonstrate that the decline in local field synchrony with cortical distance was so reliable that the interruption in the cortical sheet corresponding to the opening of the sulcus could be easily identified by monitoring just a few minutes of spontaneous LFP activity. These experiments reveal that a significant portion of spontaneous LFP fluctuations in the visual cortex is contributed by global mechanisms, imposing synchrony that is, first and foremost, a function of cortical separation between any two points.","Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Max Planck Society",,,"Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019","Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360",,,,,26,42,42,0,3,"FREUND & PETTMAN PUBLISHERS","EAST YORKSHIRE","ENHOLMES HALL, PATRINGTON, EAST YORKSHIRE HU12 OPR, ENGLAND","0334-1763",,,"REV NEUROSCIENCE","Rev.

Regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) was significantly increased (p < 0.001 uncorrected) during the acute stage in multisensory vestibular cortical and subcortical areas (parietoinsular vestibular cortex in the posterior insula, posterolateral thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus [Brodmann area 32/24], pontomesencephalic brainstem, hippocampus). Simultaneously, there was a significant rCGM decrease in the visual (Brodmann area 17 to 19) and somatosensory cortex areas in the postcentral gyrus as well as in parts of the auditory cortex (transverse temporal gyrus). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography thus allows imaging of the cortical activation pattern that is induced by unilateral peripheral vestibular loss. It was possible to demonstrate that the central vestibular system including the vestibular cortex exhibits a visual-vestibular activation-deactivation pattern during the acute stage of vestibular neuritis similar to that in healthy volunteers during unilateral labyrinthine stimulation. Contrary to experimental vestibular stimulation, the activation of the vestibular cortex was not bilateral but was unilateral and contralateral to the right-sided labyrinthine failure.","Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, D-55101 Mainz, Germany; Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Nucl Med, D-55101 Mainz, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich","Bense, S (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55101 Mainz, Germany.","bense@neurologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de","Lochmann, Matthias/AAT-3688-2021; Eulenburg, Peter zu/D-5551-2012","zu Eulenburg, Peter/0000-0002-3729-4570",,,,,31,76,78,0,5,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0364-5134","1531-8249",,"ANN NEUROL","Ann.

Two adult monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to perforin two tasks: tactile discrimination of a change in the texture of a surface presented to digits 3 and 4 and visual discrimination of a change in the intensity of a light. In each trial, standard texture (2 mm spatial period, SP) and visual stimuli were presented. These were followed by an increase in SP and/or luminance. Each trial was preceded by an instruction cue (colored light) that directed the animal to attend and respond to the change in one modality while ignoring any change in the other modality. The two tasks were interleaved during the recording, on a trial-by-trial basis. Extracellular recordings were made from 178 neurons (SI, 102; SII, 76), all with a cutaneous receptive field on the stimulated digit tips. Discharge was quantified in both tasks during the instruction, the standard-stimuli, and the texture-change periods. The results showed that selective attention to tactile stimuli had qualitatively and quantitatively greater and earlier effects in SII than SI. Twenty-four of 102 SI cells showed a significant change in discharge with the direction of attention. For almost all cells (20/24), discharge was enhanced when attention was directed toward the tactile stimuli; the effects were most frequent in the analysis interval that encompassed the change in SP (16/24). A significantly higher proportion of SII cells were attention-sensitive (47/76). The effects were concentrated in the texture-change period (39/47) but also included earlier periods in the trial (instruction period, n = 15; standard-stimuli period, n = 32). Attention-related modulation that spanned all three intervals (n = 11) likely reflected baseline changes in discharge. For the texture-sensitive cells (43 in SI, 37 in SII), the mean change in discharge frequency (post texture change - pre-texture change) in each task was significantly increased in SII but not SI with selective attention. The results are consistent with a two-stage modulation of parietal cortical discharge, an initial stage (SI) in which there is some enhancement of sensory responses to the salient feature, the texture change, and a second stage (SII) in which baseline changes occur, along with further feature selection.

Parvalbumin-IR neurons are present in layers II-VI of the macaque principal sulcus (Walker's area 46) and are concentrated in a band centered around layer IV. PV-IR cells are exclusively non-pyramidal in shape and are morphologically heterogeneous with soma sizes ranging from less than 10-mu-m to greater than 20-mu-m. Well-labeled neurons that could be classified on the basis of soma size and dendritic configuration resembled large basket and chandelier cells. A novel finding is that supragranular PV-IR neurons exhibit dendritic patterns with predominantly vertical orientations, whereas infragranular cells exhibit mostly horizontal or oblique dendritic orientations. PV-IR cells within layer IV exhibit a mixture of dendritic arrangements. Vertical rows of PV-IR puncta, 15-30-mu-m in length, resembling the cartridges of chandelier cell axons were most dense in layers II, superficial III, and the granular layer IV but were not observed in the infragranular layers. Cartridges were often present beneath unlabeled, presumed pyramidal cells. PV-IR puncta also formed pericellular nests around pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites, suggestive of basket cell innervation. PV-IR axons were occasionally observed in the white matter underlying the principal sulcus. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that PV-IR somata and dendrites are densely innervated by nonimmunoreactive terminals forming asymmetric (Gray type I) synapses as well as by fewer terminals forming symmetric (Gray type II) synapses. The majority of terminals forming symmetric synapses with PV-IR post-synaptic structures were not immunolabeled; however, some of these boutons did contain PV-immunoreactivity. PV-IR boutons exclusively form symmetric synapses and heavily innervate layer II/III pyramidal cells. PV-IR axon cartridges formed numerous axo-axonic synapses with the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells 15-20-mu-m beneath the axon hillock and also terminated on large axonal spines of the initial segment. Furthermore, we failed to observe a mixture of PV-immunoreactive and non-immunoreactive boutons composing a single axon cartridge. Pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites were also heavily innervated by PV-IR boutons forming symmetric synapses, again, consistent with basket cell innervation. In addition, PV-IR axon terminals frequently formed symmetric synapses with dendritic shafts and spines of unidentified neurons. Invariably, dendritic spines contacted by PV-IR boutons were also contacted by non-immunoreactive boutons forming asymmetric synapses, i.e., a triadic synaptic arrangement. Thus, the PV-immunolabeled subset of non-pyramidal cells, and possibly extra-cortical PV-IR afferents of the prefrontal cortex, heavily innervate both the input and output portions of layer II/III pyramidal cells and are therefore capable of extensive modulation of the excitability of associational and commissural neurons.","YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT OBSTET & GYNECOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510","Yale University","WILLIAMS, SM (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,NEUROBIOL SECT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.",,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH44866] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,46,125,126,0,7,"WILEY-LISS","NEW YORK","DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012","0021-9967",,,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

A relatively homogeneous subject group was obtained using criteria for familial pure depressive disease (FPDD), which are based upon family history as well as upon symptoms and course. Because of the absence of certain knowledge about the pathophysiology of mood disorders and their underlying functional neuroanatomy, we used data obtained from the subtraction of composite images from one-half of depressed and control subjects to identify candidate regions of interest. The major cortical region defined in this manner was statistically tested on a second set of subjects. Using this strategy, we found increased BF in an area that extended from the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex onto the medial prefrontal cortical surface. Based upon the connectivity between these portions of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala and evidence that the amygdala is involved in emotional modulation, activity was measured in the left amygdala and found to be significantly increased in the depressed group. A separate group of subjects with FPDD who were currently asymptomatic were also imaged to determine whether these findings represented abnormalities associated with the depressed state, or with a trait difference that might underlie the tendency to become depressed. Only the depressed group had increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, suggesting that this abnormality represents a state marker of FPDD. Both the depressed and the remitted groups demonstrated increased activity in the left amygdala, though this difference achieved significance only in the depressed group. This suggests that the abnormality involving the left amygdala may represent a trait marker of FPDD, though further assessment in a larger sample size is necessary to establish this. These data along with other evidence suggest that a circuit involving the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and related parts of the striatum, pallidum, and medial thalamus is involved in the functional neuroanatomy of depression.","UNIV KANSAS, SCH MED WICHITA, DEPT PSYCHIAT, WICHITA, KS 67214 USA; WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, EDWARD MALLINCKRODT INST RADIOL, DIV RADIAT SCI, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA; WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL & NEUROL SURG, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA; WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA; WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, MCDONNELL CTR STUDIES HIGHER BRAIN FUNCT, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA","University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)","DREVETS, WC (corresponding author), WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT PSYCHIAT, 4940 AUDUBON, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA.",,"anand, amit/A-7222-2009; Preskorn, Sheldon H/L-9839-2016","Carmichael, S Thomas/0000-0002-1169-9203",,,,,136,999,1028,1,65,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","1529-2401",,"J NEUROSCI","J.

The functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex implicated in vision is reviewed with the purpose of illustrating the complexity of the cortical processing in visual perception. Development.

Special attention is paid in showing the visual pathways for object and face recognition as well as spatial cognition. Conclusions. Visual cortical areas in primates and man can be divided roughly into a ventral stream in relation with the temporal lobe responsible for the processing and storage of information about the identity of objects, their shape, color, and other salient physical features; and a dorsal stream in relation with the parietal lobe and concerned with the analysis of the locations of objects, and their movements in space. These two cortical pathways are not totally segregated and both are related to the prefrontal cortex as,well as others subcortical structures such as the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus and the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei.","Univ Navarra, Dept Anat, Fac Med, E-31008 Pamplona, Navarra, Spain","University of Navarra",,,,,,,,,48,9,9,0,11,"REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA","BARCELONA","C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN","0210-0010",,,"REV NEUROLOGIA","Rev.

Little is known about the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), an area of the cortex with prominent vestibular inputs. Neural activity was recorded in the PIVC of rhesus macaques during combinations of head, body, and visual target rotations. Activity of many PIVC neurons was correlated with the motion of the head in space (vestibular), the twist of the neck (proprioceptive), and the motion of a visual target, but was not associated with eye movement. PIVC neurons responded most commonly to more than one stimulus, and responses to combined movements could often be approximated by a combination of the individual sensitivities to head, neck, and target motion. The pattern of visual, vestibular, and somatic sensitivities on PIVC neurons displayed a continuous range, with some cells strongly responding to one or two of the stimulus modalities while other cells responded to any type of motion equivalently. The PIVC contains multisensory convergence of self-motion cues with external visual object motion information, such that neurons do not represent a specific transformation of any one sensory input. Instead, the PIVC neuron population may define the movement of head, body, and external visual objects in space and relative to one another. This comparison of self and external movement is consistent with insular cortex functions related to monitoring and explains many disparate findings of previous studies.","[Shinder, Michael E.; Newlands, Shawn D.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Otolaryngol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston","Newlands, SD (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 629, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.","Shawn_newlands@urmc.rochester.edu",,,"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC0006429, F31DC 007583]","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))","This work was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (R01DC0006429 and F31DC 007583).",,83,37,37,0,11,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

In order to understand how mutations in the NF1 gene impact brain structure it is essential to characterize in detail the brain structural abnormalities in patients with NF1. Previous studies have reported contradictory findings and have focused only on volumetric measurements. Here, we investigated the volumes of subcortical structures and the composite dimensions of the cortex through analysis of cortical volume, cortical thickness, cortical surface area and gyrification. Methods: We studied 14 children with NF1 and 14 typically developing children matched for age, gender, IQ and right/left-handedness. Regional subcortical volumes and cortical gyral measurements were obtained using the FreeSurfer software. Between-group differences were evaluated while controlling for the increase in total intracranial volume observed in NF1. Results: Subcortical analysis revealed disproportionately larger thalami, right caudate and middle corpus callosum in patients with NF1. Cortical analyses on volume, thickness and surface area were however not indicative of significant alterations in patients. Interestingly, patients with NF1 had significantly lower gyrification indices than typically developing children primarily in the frontal and temporal lobes, but also affecting the insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and occipital regions. Conclusions: The neuroanatomic abnormalities observed were localized to specific brain regions, indicating that particular areas might constitute selective targets for NF1 gene mutations. Furthermore, the lower gyrification indices were accompanied by a disproportionate increase in brain size without the corresponding increase in folding in patients with NF1. Taken together these findings suggest that specific neurodevelopmental processes, such as gyrification, are more vulnerable to NF1 dysfunction than others. The identified changes in brain organization are consistent with the patterns of cognitive dysfunction in the NF1 phenotype.","[Violante, Ines R.; Ribeiro, Maria J.; Castelo-Branco, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, Fac Med, Inst Biomed Imaging & Life Sci, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal; [Silva, Eduardo D.] Ctr Hosp Coimbra, Dept Ophthalmol, P-3000075 Coimbra, Portugal; [Silva, Eduardo D.] Univ Coimbra, P-3000075 Coimbra, Portugal","Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra (CHUC); Universidade de Coimbra","Castelo-Branco, M (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Med, Inst Biomed Imaging & Life Sci, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal.","mcbranco@fmed.uc.pt","Castelo-Branco, Miguel/E-5689-2010; Castelo-Branco, Miguel/F-3866-2019; Branco, Miguel/IAQ-4914-2023; Ribeiro, Maria J/J-4618-2013","Castelo-Branco, Miguel/0000-0003-4364-6373; Ribeiro, Maria J/0000-0001-6422-3279; Violante, Ines/0000-0002-4787-2901; Silva, Eduardo/0000-0002-2739-9854","University of Coimbra [III/14/2008]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PIC/IC/83155/2007, PIC/IC/82986/2007, PTDC/SAU-ORG/118380, SFRH/BD/41348/2007, SFRH/BPD/34392/2006]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/41348/2007, PIC/IC/83155/2007] Funding Source: FCT","University of Coimbra; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We thank all the participants and their families for their involvement in this study.

Explorations of the underlying neural mechanisms have reported a gradual increase or decrease in neuronal activity prior to self-timed movements within the cortico-basal ganglia loop. Previous studies in both humans and animals have shown that endogenous dopamine (DA) plays a modulatory role in self-timing. However, the specific site of dopaminergic regulation remains elusive because the systemic application of DA-related substances can directly alter both cortical and subcortical neuronal activities. To investigate the role of striatal DA in self-timing, we locally injected DA receptor agonists or antagonists into the striatum of two female monkeys (Macaca fuscata) while they performed two versions of the memory-guided saccade (MS) task. In the conventional, triggered MS task, animals made a saccade to the location of a previously flashed visual cue in response to the fixation point offset. In the self-timed MS task, monkeys were rewarded for making a self-initiated saccade within a predetermined time interval following the cue. Infusion of a small amount of a D-1 or D-2 antagonist led to early saccades in the self-timed, but not the triggered MS tasks, while infusion of DA agonists produced no consistent effect. We also found that local administration of nicotinic but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists altered the timing of self-initiated saccades. Our data suggest that the timing of self-initiated movements may be regulated by the balance of signals in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, as well as that between both hemispheres of the brain.

In the healthy brain, somatosensory, visual, and auditory input proceeds through neocortical core and belt fields to a variety of association areas, and from here the data is transported via long cortico-cortical pathways to the extended prefrontal association cortex. Tracts generated from this highest organizational level of the brain guide the data via the frontal belt (premotor cortex) to the frontal core (primary motor area). The striatal and cerebellar loops provide the major routes for this data transfer. The main components of the limbic system (the hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala) maintain a strategic position between the sensory and the motor association areas. Part of the stream of data from the sensory association areas to the prefrontal cortex branches off and eventually converges on the entorhinal region and the amygdala. These connections establish the afferent leg of the Limbic loop. In addition, the limbic centers receive substantial input from nuclei processing viscerosensory information. The entorhinal region, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala are densely interconnected. Important among these connections is the perforant path, which originates in the entorhinal cortex and projects to the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata, Ammon's horn, and subiculum). The subiculum projects to the amygdala, entorhinal region, mamillary nuclei, and anterior and midline thalamic nuclei. The hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala generate the efferent leg of the Limbic loop, which is directed toward the prefrontal cortex. Additional projections reach the key nuclei that control endocrine and autonomic functions. Furthermore, the amygdala exerts influence on all nonthalamic nuclei projecting in a nonspecific manner to the cerebral cortex (ie, the cholinergic magnocellular forebrain nuclei, the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, the dopaminergic nuclei of the ventral tegmentum, the serotonergic anterior raphe nuclei, and the noradrenergic locus ceruleus). The limbic loop centers thus are in the unique strategic position to perform integration of exteroceptive sensory data of various sources with interoceptive stimuli from autonomic centers. Their efferent projections exert influence on both the prefrontal association cortex and the key centers controlling endocrine and autonomic functions.","UNIV MAINZ, DEPT NEUROPATHOL, D-6500 MAINZ, GERMANY","Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Braak, H (corresponding author), UNIV FRANKFURT, DEPT ANAT, THEODOR STERN KAI 7, D-60590 FRANKFURT, GERMANY.",,,"Yilmazer-Hanke, Deniz/0000-0003-1483-0286",,,,,100,81,83,1,28,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","0883-0738","1708-8283",,"J CHILD NEUROL","J.

In studies addressing these issues in young non-human primates, investigators have used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) to calculate local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (ICMRGlc). Unfortunately, these values were influenced by anesthesia. In order to avoid this confounding factor, we have established a method that permits reliable measurements in young conscious vervet monkeys using FDG-PET. Immature animals remained in a conscious, resting state during the initial 42 min of FDG uptake as they were allowed to cling to their anesthetized mothers. After FDG uptake, animals were anesthetized and placed in the PET scanner with data acquisition beginning at 60 min post-FDG injection. FDG image sets consisted of 30 planes separated by 1.69 mm, parameters sufficient to image the entire monkey brain. Our method of region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was assessed within and between raters and demonstrated high reliability (P < 0.001). To illustrate that our method was sensitive to developmental changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, quantitative studies of young conscious monkeys revealed that infant monkeys 6-8 months of age exhibited significantly higher ICMRGlc values (P < 0.05) in all regions examined, except sensorimotor cortex and thalamus, compared to monkeys younger than 4 months of age. This method provided high resolution images and ICMRGlc values that were reliable within age group. These results support the application of FDG-PET to investigate questions related to cerebral glucose metabolism in young conscious non-human primates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Under this framework, we aimed to investigate the functional specialization of the human cingulate cortex by analyzing the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of each subregion from a network perspective. In 20 healthy subjects we systematically investigated the FC patterns of the bilateral subgenual (sACC) and pregenual (pACC) anterior cingulate cortices, anterior (aMCC) and posterior (pMCC) midcingulate cortices, dorsal (dPCC) and ventral (vPCC) posterior cingulate cortices and retrosplenial cortices (RSC). We found that each cingulate subregion was specifically integrated in the predescribed functional networks and showed anti-correlated resting-state fluctuations. The sACC and pACC were involved in an affective network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor and cognitive networks, while the pACC also correlated with the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the visual network. In the midcingulate cortex, however, the aMCC was correlated with the cognitive and sensorimotor networks and anti-correlated with the visual, affective and default-mode networks, whereas the pMCC only correlated with the sensorimotor network and anti-correlated with the cognitive and visual networks. The dPCC and vPCC involved in the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor, cognitive and visual networks, in contrast, the RSC was mainly correlated with the PCC and thalamus. Based on a strong hypothesis driven approach of anatomical partitions of the cingulate cortex, we could confirm their segregation in terms of functional neuroanatomy, as suggested earlier by task studies or exploratory multi-seed investigations.

Objectives: To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine. Design: Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced-order design. In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo. In the second experiment, pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release. Setting: Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Manchester, England. Participants: Thirty-three healthy, right-handed men were recruited by advertisements. Interventions: In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous ketamine (1-minute bolus of 0.26 mg/ kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg/ kg/ h for the remainder of the session) or placebo (0.9% saline solution). In experiment 2, participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1. Main Outcome Measures: Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician- Administered Dissociative States Scale scores. Results: Ketamine induced a rapid, focal, and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex, including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate, which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid- posterior cingulate, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions (r= 0.90). Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores. Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms. Conclusions: These 2 changes may underpin 2 fundamental processes of psychosis: abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive- emotional evaluation of their significance. The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release.","[Deakin, J. F. William; Lees, Jane; Mckie, Shane; Hallak, Jaime E.

Intracortical responses were analysed in two latency ranges: 0-50 ms and 50-150 ms after stimulus. In all patients, we recorded in the first 50 ms after stimulus two positive P14 and P20 potentials followed by a N30 negativity. In the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, the P20-N30 potentials showed a clear amplitude decrease from the outer to the inner aspect of the frontal lobe with minimal amplitudes in the pre-SMA. In the hemisphere ipsilateral to stimulus, P20 and N30 amplitudes were decreasing from mesial to lateral frontal cortex. In the 50-150 ms latency range, contacts implanted in the pre-SMA recorded a negative potential in the 60-70 ms latency range which, in five patients, was followed by a positive response peaking 80-110 ms after stimulus. These potentials were not picked up by more superficial contacts. We conclude that no early SEP is generated in pre-SMA in the first 50 ms after stimulation, while some potentials peaking in the 60-100 ms after stimulus are likely to originate from this cortical area. The latency of the pre-SMA responses recorded in our patients supports the hypothesis that the pre-SMA does not receive short-latency somatosensory inputs via direct thalamocortical projections. More probably the pre-SMA receives somatosensory inputs mediated by a polysynaptic transcortical transmission through functionally secondary motor and somatosensory areas.","Hop Neurol, Funct Neurol & Epileptol Dept, F-69003 Lyon, France; Hop Neurol, Dept Funct Neurosurg, F-69003 Lyon, France","CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon","Mauguiere, F (corresponding author), Hop Neurol, Funct Neurol & Epileptol Dept, 59 Blvd Pinel, F-69003 Lyon, France.","mauguier@cismsun.univ-lyon1.fr","FROT, Maud/S-8930-2019; barba, carmen/K-4942-2016; Barba, Carmen/AAB-7162-2022; mauguiere, frederic a l/C-6383-2013","FROT, Maud/0000-0002-7783-9256; barba, carmen/0000-0001-5445-5842; mauguiere, frederic a l/0000-0002-9150-8584; MAUGUIERE, Francois/0000-0003-4291-4727; GUENOT, Marc/0000-0003-1632-2138",,,,,68,44,44,0,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding(9), attention(11), stimulus discrimination(4), and motor behaviour(12). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood(2,3,13-20), and its coding implications are still debated(13,16,21,22). It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate- and- fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold- linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77204 USA","New York University; New York University; University of Houston System; University of Houston","Doiron, B (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.","jrocha@cns.nyu.edu; bdoiron@cns.nyu.edu","de la Rocha, Jaime/I-2119-2015","de la Rocha, Jaime/0000-0002-3314-9384",,,,,30,471,473,3,66,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","0028-0836","1476-4687",,"NATURE","Nature","AUG 16",2007,448,7155,,,,,802,"U6",,"10.1038/nature06028","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06028"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06028"")",,,6,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","200HJ",17700699,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000248754200039","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000248754200039"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The human LGN is composed mainly of magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) subdivisions, each of which has different stimulus selectivity in neural response properties. Previous studies have discussed the potential relationship between LGN subdivisions and visual disorders based on psychophysical data on specific types of visual stimuli. However, these relationships remain speculative because non-invasive measurements of these subdivisions are difficult due to the small size of the LGN. Here we propose a method to identify these subdivisions by combining two structural MR measures: high-resolution proton-density weighted images and macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) maps. We defined the M and P subdivisions based on MTV fraction data and tested the validity of the definition by (1) comparing the data with that from human histological studies, (2) comparing the data with functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements on stimulus selectivity, and (3) analyzing the test-retest reliability. The findings demonstrated that the spatial organization of the M and P subdivisions was consistent across subjects and in line with LGN subdivisions observed in human histological data. Moreover, the difference in stimulus selectivity between the subdivisions identified using MTV was consistent with previous physiology literature. The definition of the subdivisions based on MTV was shown to be robust over measurements taken on different days. These results suggest that MTV mapping is a promising approach for evaluating the tissue properties of LGN subdivisions in living humans. This method potentially will enable neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses about the human LGN subdivisions to be tested.","[Oishi, Hiroki; Takemura, Hiromasa; Amano, Kaoru] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Adv ICT Res Inst, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Oishi, Hiroki; Takemura, Hiromasa; Amano, Kaoru] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Oishi, Hiroki] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Takemura, Hiromasa] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Sensory & Cognit Brain Mapping, Dept Syst Neurosci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Takemura, Hiromasa] SOKENDAI Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Physiol Sci, Sch Life Sci, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400193, Japan; [Amano, Kaoru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan; Osaka University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; University of Tokyo","Oishi, H; Takemura, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Adv ICT Res Inst, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.","hoishi@berkeley.edu; htakemur@nips.ac.jp","Takemura, Hiromasa/AAD-6065-2019","Takemura, Hiromasa/0000-0002-2096-2384; Oishi, Hiroki/0000-0002-3955-7135","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP20J11101, JP17H04684, JP21H03789]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Yusuke Sakai for supporting data curation and analysis and Taiki Aoyama for supporting data analysis.

This large fiber bundle is abnormal in several psychiatric illnesses and a major target for deep brain stimulation. Yet, we have very little information about where specific prefrontal fibers travel within the bundle. Using a combination of tracing studies and diffusion MRI in male nonhuman primates, as well as diffusion MRI in male and female human subjects, we segmented the human ALIC into five regions based on the positions of axons from different cortical regions within the capsule. Fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder were detected when FA was averaged in the ALIC segment that carries ventrolateral prefrontal cortical connections. Together, the results set the stage for linking abnormalities within the ALIC to specific connections and demonstrate the utility of applying connectivity profiles of large white matter bundles based on animal anatomic studies to human connections and associating disease abnormalities in those pathways with specific connections. The ability to functionally segment large white matter bundles into their components begins a new era of refining how we think about white matter organization and use that information in understanding abnormalities.","[Safadi, Ziad; Heilbronner, Sarah R.; Lehman, Julia F.; Haber, Suzanne N.] Univ Rochester, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Sch Med & Dent, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Grisot, Giorgia; Mandeville, Joe; Yendiki, Anastasia] Harvard Univ, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Grisot, Giorgia; Mandeville, Joe; Yendiki, Anastasia] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Grisot, Giorgia] MIT, Harvard MIT Hlth Sci & Technol, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jbabdi, Saad; Behrens, Timothy E.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Wellcome Ctr Integrat Neuroimaging, Ctr Funct MRI Brain FMRIB, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Behrens, Timothy E.; McLaughlin, Nicole C.

Spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in the C3-T6 spinal segments were studied for their responses to stimulation of phrenic and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent fibers. A total of 142 STT neurons were studied in 44 anesthetized, paralyzed monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). All neurons were antidromically activated from the ventroposterolateral nucleus and/or medial thalamus. 2. Electrical stimulation of phrenic afferent fibers (PHR) excited 43/58 (74%), inhibited 2/58 (3%), and did not affect 13/58 (13%) of cervical STT neurons. Neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to the proximal limb or encompassing the whole limb were excited to a significantly greater extent by electrical stimulation of PHR than were neurons with somatic fields confined to the distal limb. Mechanical stimulation of PHR by probing the exposed diaphragm excited 11/22 (50%), inhibited 3/22 (14%), and did not affect 8/22 (36%) cervical STT neurons. 3. The technique of minimum afferent conduction velocity (MACV) was used to obtain information about the identity of the PHR that excited 35 cervical STT neurons. Evidence was obtained for excitation of these neurons by group II and III PHR. The mean +/- SE MACV for all neurons was 14 +/- 2 m/s. 4. Electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary spinal afferent fibers excited 41/57 (72%), inhibited 8/57 (14%), and did not affect 8/57 (14%) of cervical STT neurons. Neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to the proximal limb or encompassing the whole limb were excited to a significantly greater extent by electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary spinal afferents than were neurons with somatic fields confined to the distal limb. 5. Excitatory convergence of PHR and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input was observed for 36/57 (63%) cervical STT neurons. 6. Electrical stimulation of PHR excited 36/84 (43%), inhibited 25/84 (30%), and did not affect 23/84 (27%) of thoracic STT neurons. All of these neurons received excitatory cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input. 7. Neurons were more likely to be excited by electrical stimulation of PHR if they were located in C3-C6 spinal segments. Furthermore, the net excitatory effect of PHR input decreased in more caudal segments, such that thoracic STT neurons were weakly excited relative to cervical STT neurons. 8. We conclude that cervical STT neurons with excitatory somatic fields that include or are restricted to proximal sites are excited by electrical or mechanical stimulation of PHR. Those effects demonstrate a physiological substrate for pain referred from the diaphragm to the shoulder in patients with pleural effusions or subphrenic abscesses. Excitatory convergence of PHR and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input on cervical STT neurons is consistent with the fact that referred pain fields in cardiac and diaphragmatic diseases can include cervical dermatomes. However, the restricted referred pain fields observed in patients with diaphragmatic pain cannot be entirely explained by somatic field sizes of cervical or thoracic STT neurons. We propose that, in addition to input from the STT, dorsal column input to supra-spinal sites may be important in refining the extent of referred pain fields in diseases involving the diaphragm.",,,"BOLSER, DC (corresponding author), UNIV OKLAHOMA,HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT PHYSIOL & BIOPHYS,OKLAHOMA CITY,OK 73190, USA.",,"Bolser, Donald/CAI-2644-2022","Brennan, Timothy/0000-0002-0150-5145","NHLBI NIH HHS [HL-22732, HL-07304] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-08150] Funding Source: Medline","NHLBI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,61,36,37,0,1,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Capsaicin treatment produced activation in many discrete brain regions which we classified as subserving four main functions: sensation-perception (primary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and insula); attention (anterior cingulate cortex); descending pain control (periaqueductal grey); and an extensive network related to sensory-motor integration (supplementary motor cortex, bilateral putamen and insula, anterior lobe and vermis of the cerebellum and superior colliculus), Comparison of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli yielded several new insights into neural organization of pain and tactile sensations. Capsaicin pain, which had no concomitant tactile component, produced little or no activation in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), whereas light brushing produced a prominent activation of SII, suggesting a differential sensitivity of Sn: to tactile versus painful stimuli. The cerebellar vermis was strongly activated by capsaicin, whereas light brush and experimental allodynia produced little or no activation, suggesting a selective association with C-fibre stimulation and nociceptive second-order spinal neurons. The experimental allodynia activated a network that partially overlapped those activated by both pain and light brush alone. Unlike capsaicin-induced pain, allodynia was characterized by bilateral activation of inferior prefrontal cortex, suggesting that prefrontal responses to pain are context dependent.","NIDR, PNMB, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIH, Off Director, Lab Diagnost Radiol Res, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA","Iadarola, MJ (corresponding author), NIDR, PNMB, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 1A11,49 Convent Dr,MSC 4410, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,"Zeffiro, Thomas/AAE-3441-2019","Zeffiro, Thomas/0000-0002-0846-4577",,,,,75,284,287,0,7,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950",,,"BRAIN","Brain","MAY",1998,121,,5,,,,931,947,,"10.1093/brain/121.5.931","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.5.931"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.5.931"")",,,17,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","ZQ712",9619195,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000073895500012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000073895500012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality contexts. Subjects underwent differential context conditioning in which they were repeatedly exposed to two contexts (CXT+ and CXT-) in semirandom order, with contexts counterbalanced across participants. An unsignaled footshock was consistently paired with the CXT+, and no shock was ever delivered in the CXT-. Evidence for context conditioning was established using skin conductance and anxiety ratings. Consistent with animal models centrally implicating the hippocampus and amygdala in a network supporting context conditioning, CXT+ compared with CXT-significantly activated right anterior hippocampus and bilateral amygdala. In addition, context conditioning was associated with activation in posterior orbitofrontal cortex, medial dorsal thalamus, anterior insula, subgenual anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and parietal cortices. Structural equation modeling was used to assess interactions among the core brain regions mediating context conditioning. The derived model indicated that medial amygdala was the source of key efferent and afferent connections including input from orbitofrontal cortex.

Cadaveric allografts are one potential reconstructive material, but their use requires systemic immunosuppression. Cold preservation (7 weeks) renders allografts devoid of antigens, but these acellular substrates generally fail in supporting regeneration beyond 3 cm. In this study, the authors evaluated the reconstruction of extensive nonhuman primate peripheral nerve defects using 7-week cold-preserved allografts repopulated with cultured autologous Schwann cells. Methods: Ten outbred Macaca fascicularis primates were paired based on maximal genetic disparity as measured by similarity index assay. A total of 14 ulnar nerve defects measuring 6 cm were successfully reconstructed using autografts (n = 5), fresh allografts (n = 2), cold-preserved allografts (n = 3), or cold-preserved allografts seeded with autogenous Schwann cells (n 4). Recipient immunoreactivity was evaluated by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, and nerves were harvested at 6 months for histologic and histomorphometric analysis. Results: Cytokine production in response to cold-preserved allografts and cold-preserved allografts seeded with autologous Schwann cells was similar to that observed for autografts. Schwann cell-repopulated cold-preserved grafts demonstrated significantly enhanced fiber counts, nerve density, and percentage nerve (p < 0.05) compared with unseeded cold-preserved grafts at 6 months after reconstruction. Conclusions: Cold-preserved allografts seeded with autologous Schwann cells were well-tolerated in unrelated recipients and supported significant regeneration across 6-cm peripheral nerve defects. Use of cold-preserved allogeneic nerve tissue supplemented with autogenous Schwarm cells poses a potentially safe and effective alternative to the use of autologous tissue in the reconstruction of extensive nerve injuries.","Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)","Mackinnon, SE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 660 S Euclid Ave,Campus Box 8238, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.","mackinnons@wustl.edu",,,"NINDS NIH HHS [5-R01 NS33406-11] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,75,73,81,0,9,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0032-1052","1529-4242",,"PLAST RECONSTR SURG","Plast.

MAP 2-immunostained neurons are present through the depth of area 17 but are most intensely immunoreactive in layers IVB and VI. From layer IVB, separate groups of MAP 2-positive cells invade layers IVA and IVCalpha. Clusters of cells protrude upward from superficial layer IVB and occupy the central core regions of the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-stained honeycomb in layer IVA, while large neurons typical of layer IVB are distributed in irregular clusters in the subjacent layer IVCalpha. The somata in the layer IVA honeycomb cores give off immunostained dendrites which remain largely within the core regions. Patches of MAP 2-positive neurons are also present in layers II and III, where they coincide with the CO-stained puffs. Intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into one eye of adult monkeys produce stripes of alternating light and dark MAP 2 immunostaining in layer IVC. Stripes of light immunostaining coincide with stripes of light CO staining, and correspond to reduced MAP 2 immunoreactivity within cortical neurons dominated by the TTX-injected eye. In layers II and III, the MAP 2 immunostaining of patches overlying the injected-eye columns is similarly reduced. No change occurs in the MAP 2 immunostaining of layer IVA. These data suggest that the anatomical and physiological heterogeneity of layers IVA and IVCalpha arises from the periodic invasion of neurons characteristic of layer IVB, that the neurons in layer IVA have dendrites confined to thalamocortical-recipient or nonrecipient zones and that the expression of MAP 2 changes in adult cortical neurons following the loss of retinal input.",,,"HENDRY, SHC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.",,,,"NIA NIH HHS [P50 AG054142] Funding Source: Medline","NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))",,,94,39,39,0,1,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0952-5238","1469-8714",,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","NOV",1992,9,5,,,,,445,459,,"10.1017/S0952523800011251","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800011251"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800011251"")",,,15,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","JU214",1333277,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1992JU21400002","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1992JU21400002"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Attention seems to have a reciprocal relation with binding, inasmuch as the latter promotes the composition of features and their dependencies, while the former selects a single characteristic independently of the remainder. Classically, binding is viewed as a process whereby sets of properties are gathered in representative entities, which are themselves linked to form higher level structures, in a sequence that culminates in the total integration of the pattern features in a localized construct. The convergent axonal projections from one cortical area to another would be the neurobiological mechanism through which binding is achieved. Attention comprises the selective excitation of neuronal networks or pathways that stand for specific pattern properties. The thalamus and its reticular nucleus would then be the anatomical substrate of the attentional focus. In this paper we propose a computational model aiming at bringing together the main (and apparently diverging) ideas about binding and attention. Based on experimental data, a neuronal network representing cortical pyramidal cells is assembled, and its structure and function are related to the binding and attention phenomena. Actually, the convergent projections that enlarge the visual receptive field are associated to binding, while a specific change in the pyramidal cell behavior is responsible for attention. Computer simulations are shown which reproduce the electrophysiology of pyramidal cells and mimic some interesting experimental results in visual attention. We conclude by conjecturing that attention is a driven interruption in the regular process of binding.","INST LOG FILOSOFIA & TEOR CIENCIA, BR-24030 NITEROI, RJ, BRAZIL; INST BRASILEIRO GEOG & ESTAT, BR-20941 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",,"DECARVALHO, LAV (corresponding author), FED UNIV RIO DE JANEIRO, COPPE, PROGRAMA ENGN SISTEMAS & COMP, CP 68511, BR-21945970 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.",,,,,,,,24,10,10,0,0,"ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD","CLARE","ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","0020-7101",,,"INT J BIOMED COMPUT","Int.

The anterior and posterior parts of the BMA, recognized on cytoarchitectonic grounds, display very different projection patterns. Within the amygdala, the anterior basomedial nucleus (BMAa) heavily innervates the central, medial, and anterior cortical nuclei. In contrast, the posterior basomedial nucleus (BMAp) sends a dense projection to the lateral nucleus, and to restricted parts of the central and medial nuclei. Extra-amygdalar projections from the BMA are divided into ascending and descending components. The former end in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and septum. The BMAa mainly innervates olfactory (piriform, transitional) and insular areas, whereas the BMAp also innervates inferior temporal (perirhinal, ectorhinal) and medial prefrontal (infralimbic, prelimbic) areas and the hippocampal formation. Within the striatum, the BMAa densely innervates the striatal fundus, whereas the nucleus accumbens receives a heavy input from the BMAp. Both parts of the BMA send massive projections to distinct regions of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis. Descending projections from the BMA end primarily in the hypothalamus. The BMAa sends a major input to the lateral hypothalamic area, whereas the BMAp innervates the ventromedial nucleus particularly heavily. Injections were also placed in the anterior cortical nucleus (COAa), a cell group superficially adjacent to the BMAa. PHAL-labeled axons from this cell group mainly ascend into the amygdala and olfactory areas, and descend into the thalamus and lateral hypothalamic area. Based on connections, the COAa and BMAa are part of the same functional system. The results suggest that cytoarchitectonically distinct anterior and posterior parts of the BMA are also hodologically distinct and form parts of distinct anatomical circuits probably involved in mediating different behaviors (for example, feeding and social behaviors vs. emotion-related learning, respectively).

A central problem in determining how visual information is processed is understanding how each of these RGC types connects to more central structures, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and (via the LGN) the primary visual cortex. Neverthelss, the available functional and anatomical evidence linking together specific cell types across these structures is surprisingly indirect. This review evaluates the available evidence and assesses the strength of the many inferences that can be made from these observations. There is strong evidence that parasol RGCs are the provenance of the magnocellular (M) visual pathway and that midget RGCs give rise to the parvocellular (P) pathway. Furthermore, the M and P pathways remain segregated up to the input layer of primary visual cortex. The relationships between the numerous other RGC types and cell types in the LGN remain less certain. and there remains ambiguity about how best to define additional pathways, such as the koniocellular (K) pathway, which probably arise from these other, less common, RGC types.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Salk Institute","Callaway, EM (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","callaway@salk.edu","Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011","Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267",,,,,37,147,149,0,27,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3751","1469-7793",,"J PHYSIOL-LONDON","J.

The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra- and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of Nurr1/Nr4a2, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.","[Bruguier, Hannah; Hoerder-Suabedissen, Anna; Shelton, Andrew M.; Oliver, David K.; Packer, Adam M.; Molnar, Zoltan] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Suarez, Rodrigo] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Manger, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anat Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ferran, Jose L.; Puelles, Luis] Univ Murcia, Sch Med, Dept Human Anat, Murcia, Spain; [Ferran, Jose L.; Puelles, Luis] Murcia Arrixaca Inst Biomed Res, Murcia, Spain; [Garcia-Moreno, Fernando] Achucarro Basque Ctr Neurosci, Zamudio, Spain; [Garcia-Moreno, Fernando] IKERBASQUE Fdn, Bilbao, Spain","University of Oxford; University of Queensland; University of Witwatersrand; University of Murcia; Basque Foundation for Science","Molnar, Z (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England.","zoltan.molnar@dpag.ox.ac.uk","Molnar, Zoltan/J-7281-2012; Ferran, Jose/H-6288-2011","Molnar, Zoltan/0000-0002-6852-6004; Ferran, Jose/0000-0002-3413-9452; Hoerder-Suabedissen, Anna/0000-0003-1953-7871; PUELLES, LUIS/0000-0002-9541-7073; Suarez, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5153-5652; Packer, Adam/0000-0001-5884-794X","Human Frontier Science Program; Medical Research Council; Royal Society; Wellcome Trust; ARC [ARC-DP160103958, DE160101394]; Seneca Foundation [19904/GERM/15]; FEDER [PGC2018-098229-B-100, PGC2018-096173-A-100]; MICINN; BBSRC [BB/I021833/1, BB/F003285/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/N026039/1, G0900901, G0700377, G0300200] Funding Source: UKRI; Australian Research Council [DE160101394] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Human Frontier Science Program(Human Frontier Science Program); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); ARC(Australian Research Council); Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); MICINN(Spanish Government); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Human Frontier Science Program; Medical Research Council; The Royal Society; Wellcome Trust; ARC, Grant/Award Numbers: ARC-DP160103958, DE160101394; Seneca Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 19904/GERM/15; FEDER, Grant/Award Numbers: PGC2018-098229-B-100, PGC2018-096173-A-100; MICINN",,146,27,27,2,7,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-9967","1096-9861",,"J COMP NEUROL","J.

What specific aspects of M1 function are abnormal remains uncertain, however. Moreover, few models consider the possibility that distinct cortical neuron subtypes may be affected differently. Those questions were addressed by studying the resting activity of intratelencephalic-type corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) and distant-projecting lamina 5b pyramidal-tract type neurons (PTNs) in the macaque M1 before and after the induction of parkinsonism by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Contrary to previous reports, the general population of M1 neurons (i.e., PTNs, CSNs, and unidentified neurons) showed reduced baseline firing rates following MPTP, attributable largely to a marked decrease in PTN firing rates. CSN firing rates were unmodified. Although burstiness and firing patterns remained constant in M1 neurons as a whole and CSNs in particular, PTNs became more bursty post-MPTP and less likely to fire in a regular-spiking pattern. Rhythmic spiking (found in PTNs predominantly) occurred at beta frequencies (14-32 Hz) more frequently following MPTP. These results indicate that MPTP intoxication induced distinct modifications in the activity of different M1 neuronal subtypes. The particular susceptibility of PTNs suggests that PTN dysfunction may be an important contributor to the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor signs.","[Pasquereau, Benjamin] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh","Pasquereau, B (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.","benp@pitt.edu","Pasquereau, Benjamin/O-7232-2019; Turner, Robert S/A-9695-2008","Pasquereau, Benjamin/0000-0003-2855-0672; Turner, Robert S/0000-0002-6074-4365","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health [NS044551, NS055197]","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health (grant numbers NS044551 and NS055197 to R.

Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axone emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons; that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows single GPe neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the STN, which is the claimed GPe target, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi.

We defined two cortical areas of activation in the operculo-insular cortex in response to a painful laser stimulation: a suprasylvian opercular area, where we recorded responses peaking 140-170 ms after a painful stimulation (N140-P170), and a deeper insular area, where responses with a similar pattern peaked 180-230 ms after the stimulus (N180-P230). The average delay of 50 ms measured between the opercular and insular responses may reflect either sequential activation of the suprasylvian cortex then of the insula via corticocortical connections, or direct activation of the insula by inputs conveyed via thalamocortical projections through distinct fibres with different conduction times. We also recorded similar insular and opercular responses in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation, peaking 15 ms later than contralateraI responses; this delay is compatible with transcallosal input transmission between these cortices. The mean stereotactic coordinates of the suprasylvian opercular N140-P170 and insular N180-P230 responses were found to be very similar to those of the maximal blood-flow responses to pain reported by previous PET and functional MRI studies in these cortical areas. We were able to distinguish the suprasylvian opercular and insular cortices in terms of response latencies evoked by a painful stimulus and in terms of stereotactic coordinates of the sources of these responses. The sequential timing of activation of the suprasylvian and insular cortices shown in this study thus complements in the time domain the spatial information provided by neuro-imaging studies of the cortical processing of pain. It strongly suggests that these cortical areas are those responding with the shortest latency to peripheral pain inputs in the human brain.","Hop Neurol, Dept Funct Neurol & Epileptol, F-69003 Lyon, France","CHU Lyon","Frot, M (corresponding author), Hop Neurol, Dept Funct Neurol & Epileptol, 59 Blvd Pinel, F-69003 Lyon, France.","timo@hydromail.com","FROT, Maud/S-8930-2019; mauguiere, frederic a l/C-6383-2013","FROT, Maud/0000-0002-7783-9256; mauguiere, frederic a l/0000-0002-9150-8584; MAUGUIERE, Francois/0000-0003-4291-4727",,,,,72,167,171,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","FEB",2003,126,,2,,,,438,450,,"10.1093/brain/awg032","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awg032"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awg032"")",,,13,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","650QR",12538410,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000181275300016","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000181275300016"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Six amblyopes participated in this study. Standard retinotopic mapping stimuli were used to define the boundaries of early visual cortical areas. We obtained fMRI time series from thalamic, striate and extrastriate cortical regions for the connectivity study. Thalamo-striate and striate-extrastriate networks were constructed based on known anatomical connections and the effective connectivities of these networks were assessed by means of a nonlinear system identification method. The effective connectivity of all networks studied was reduced when driven by the amblyopic eye, suggesting contrary to the current single-cell model of localized signal reduction, that a significant part of the amblyopic deficit is due to anomalous interactions between cells in disparate brain regions. The effective connectivity loss was unrelated to the fMRI loss but correlated with the degree of amblyopia (ipsilateral LGN to V1 connection), suggesting that it may be a more relevant measure. Feedforward and feedback connectivities were similarly affected. A hemispheric dependence was found for the thalamo-striate feedforward input that was not present for the feedback connection, suggesting that the reduced function of the LGN recently found in amblyopic humans may not be solely determined by the feedback influence from the cortex. Both ventral and dorsal connectivities were reduced. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In rat, dendritic symmetry of the 2 main excitatory neuronal classes, spiny stellate and star pyramid neurons (SSNs and SPNs), was quantified by an asymmetry index, the dendrite-free angle. We carefully measured shrinkage and analyzed its influence on morphological parameters. SSNs had mostly eccentric morphology, whereas SPNs were nearly radially symmetric. Most asymmetric neurons were located near the barrel border. The axonal projections, analyzed at the level of layer 4, were mostly restricted to a single barrel except for those of 3 interbarrel projection neurons. Comparing voxel representations of dendrites and axon collaterals of the same neuron revealed a close overlap of dendritic and axonal fields, more pronounced in SSNs versus SPNs and considerably stronger in spiny L4 neurons versus extragranular pyramidal cells. These observations suggest that within a barrel dendrites and axons of individual excitatory cells are organized in subcolumns that may confer receptive field properties such as directional selectivity to higher layers, whereas the interbarrel projections challenge our view of barrels as completely independent processors of thalamic input.","[Egger, Veronica] Max Planck Inst Med Res, Dept Cell Physiol, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Max Planck Society","Egger, V (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Inst Physiol, Pettenkoferstr 12, D-80336 Munich, Germany.","V.Egger@lmu.de","Egger, Veronica/HJG-9882-2022; Bruno, Randy M./ABC-2117-2021","Bruno, Randy M./0000-0002-5122-4632; Nevian, Thomas/0000-0001-9804-608X",,,,,72,62,62,1,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Importantly, however, the combination of audition and touch can guide our behavior as effectively which we studied here using psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We tested whether task-irrelevant tactile stimuli would enhance auditory detection, and whether hemispheric asymmetries would modulate these audiotactile benefits using lateralized sounds. Spatially aligned task-irrelevant tactile stimuli could occur either synchronously or asynchronously with the sounds. Auditory detection was enhanced by non-informative synchronous and asynchronous tactile stimuli, if presented on the left side. Elevated fMRI-signals to left-sided synchronous bimodal stimulation were found in primary auditory cortex (A1). Adjacent regions (planum temporale, PT) expressed enhanced BOLD-responses for synchronous and asynchronous left-sided bimodal conditions. Additional connectivity analyses seeded in right-hemispheric A1 and PT for both bimodal conditions showed enhanced connectivity with right-hemispheric thalamic, somatosensory and multisensory areas that scaled with subjects' performance. Our results indicate that functional asymmetries interact with audiotactile interplay which can be observed for left-lateralized stimulation in the right hemisphere. There, audiotactile interplay recruits a functional network of unisensory cortices, and the strength of these functional network connections is directly related to subjects' perceptual sensitivity.

Previous studies using the 2-deoxyglucose method have shown that thalamic and hippocampal structures thought to be involved in visual recognition memory are also engaged by spatial and object working memory tasks in the nonhuman primate. Networks engaged in memory processing can be recognized by analysis of patterns of activation accompanying performance of specifically designed tasks. In the present study, we compared metabolic activation of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex during the performance of three working memory tasks [delayed response (DR), delayed alternation (DA), and delayed object alternation (DOA)] to that induced by a standard recognition memory task [delayed match-to-sample (DMS)] and a sensorimotor control task in rhesus monkeys. A region-of-interest analysis revealed elevated local cerebral glucose utilization in the perirhinal cortex in animals performing the DA, DOA, and DMS tasks, and animals performing the DMS task were distinct in showing a strong focus of activation in the lateral perirhinal cortex. No significant differences were evident between groups performing memory and control tasks in the entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex may play a much broader role in memory processing than has been previously thought, encompassing explicit working memory as well as recognition memory.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Neurobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Yale University","Davachi, L (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, NE-20 Rm 343,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","lila@psyche.mit.edu",,"Davachi, Lila/0000-0003-4317-0889","NIMH NIH HHS [MH-38546] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,53,51,51,0,0,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Many of the theoretical models advanced to explain function in this system, however, do not reflect the wealth of information on the connectivity of these structures, and employ greatly simplified treatments of its complex connectivity. We were interested in whether a more analytical approach, which begins with analysis of the connectivity of the system, might provide insights complementary to those derived by synthetic models. Accordingly, We collated detailed neuroanatomical information about the connectivity of the hippocampal system in the rat, and analysed the resulting data. Analyses of connectivity based on a variety of different analytical techniques have recently been used to elucidate the global organization of other systems in the macaque and cat, and have given rise to successful predictions. We applied non-metric multidimensional scaling and non-parametric cluster analysis to our summary matrix of connection data. The analyses produced organizational schemes that were consistent with known physiological properties and provided the basis for making tentative predictions of the further structures that may contain 'place' and 'head-direction' cells, which structures we identify. The consistency between the analyses of connectivity and the distribution of physiological properties across the system suggests that functional relationships are constrained by the organization of the connectivity of the system, and so that structure and function are linked at the systems level.","Newcastle Univ, Dept Psychol, Neural Syst Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England","Newcastle University - UK","Burns, GAPC (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, USC Brain Project, Hedco Neurosci Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",,,"Burns, Gully/0000-0003-1493-865X",,,,,73,51,53,0,5,"ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8436","1471-2970",,"PHILOS T R SOC B","Philos.

Here we identify a pathway from the first synapse in the retina to koniocellular layer K1 in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Particle-mediated gene transfer of an expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP) was used to label excitatory synapses on retinal ganglion cells and combined with immunofluorescence to identify the presynaptic bipolar cells. We found that axon terminals of one type of diffuse bipolar cell (DB6) provide dominant synaptic input to the dendrites of narrow thorny ganglion cells. Retrograde tracer injections into the LGN and photofilling of retinal ganglion cells showed that narrow thorny cells were preferentially labeled when koniocellular layer K1 was targeted. Layer K1 contains cells with high sensitivity for rapid movement, and layer K1 sends projections to association visual areas as well as to primary visual cortex. We hypothesize that the DB6-narrow thorny-koniocellular pathway contributes to residual visual functions (blindsight) that survive injury to primary visual cortex in adult or early life.","[Percival, Kumiko A.; Masri, Rania A.; Martin, Paul R.; Gruenert, Ulrike] Univ Sydney, Dept Ophthalmol, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Percival, Kumiko A.; Masri, Rania A.; Martin, Paul R.; Gruenert, Ulrike] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Percival, Kumiko A.; Martin, Paul R.; Gruenert, Ulrike] Univ Sydney, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Martin, Paul R.; Gruenert, Ulrike] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Koizumi, Amane] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cell Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Koizumi, Amane] Grad Univ Adv Studies SOKENDAI, Sch Life Sci, Dept Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Buzas, Peter] Univ Pecs, Sch Med, Inst Physiol, H-7624 Pecs, Hungary","University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; University of Pecs","Grunert, U (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Macquarie St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.","ugrunert@sydney.edu.au","Grünert, Ulrike/Q-6944-2019; Grunert, Ulrike/A-5194-2012; Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009; Koizumi, Amane/E-7771-2011","Grünert, Ulrike/0000-0002-9595-8152; Grunert, Ulrike/0000-0002-9595-8152; Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Koizumi, Amane/0000-0003-1177-0185","National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [632640, 1042609]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan; Hungarian Academy of Sciences","National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported by Project Grants 632640 and 1042609 from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia to U.G. and P.R.M., a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan to A.K., and a Bolyai fellowship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to P.B.

These aspects of vision that survive V1 lesions have been attributed to direct thalamic pathways to extrastriate areas, including the middle temporal area (MT). However, studies in New World monkeys and humans have questioned this interpretation, suggesting that remnants of V1 are responsible for both the activation of MT and residual vision. We studied the visual responses of neurons in area MT in New World marmoset monkeys in the weeks after lesions of V1. The extent of the scotoma in each case was estimated by mapping the receptive fields of cells located near the lesion border and by histological reconstruction. Two response types were observed among the cells located in the part of MT that corresponds, in visuotopic coordinates, to the lesioned part of V1. Many neurons (62%) had receptive fields that were displaced relative to their expected location, so that they represented the visual field immediately surrounding the scotoma. This may be a consequence of a process analogous to the reorganization of the V1 map after retinal lesions. However, another 20% of the cells had receptive fields centered inside the scotoma. Most of these neurons were strongly direction-selective, similar to normal MT cells. These results show that MT cells differ in their responses to lesioning of V1 and that only a subpopulation of MT neurons can be reasonably linked to residual vision and blindsight.","Univ Queensland, Vis Touch & Hearing Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Monash Univ, Dept Physiol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; Australian Natl Univ, Div Psychol, Canberra, ACT, Australia","University of Queensland; Monash University; Australian National University","Rosa, MGP (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Vis Touch & Hearing Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Rosa, Marcello G/D-9278-2013","Rosa, Marcello G/0000-0002-6620-6285",,,,,42,74,75,0,3,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

On the basis of the following criteria: the size and the shape of the synaptic vesicles, the distribution and density of the vesicular population, the size and the shape of the synaptic boutons, their origin, an the characteristics of the active synaptic zones, several types of synaptic boutons in the ICc have been discriminated: LR1, LR2, SR, SSB, F1, F2, P, DCV-terminals, and d-profiles. The LR 1, LR2, SR and SSB bouton types contain clear, round or slightly oval synaptic vesicles and form asymmetrical synapses mainly with middle sized and small dendrites and dendritic spines. LR2-terminals not rarely contact also the neuronal perikarya, whilst the SR-boutons form exclusively axodendritic and axospinous synapses. The P, F1 and F2-boutons contain a pleomorphic vesicular population (P-boutons), with an increased degree of vesicle flattening (F1 and F2-boutons) and form symmetrical axosomatic, axodendritic and axospinous contacts. Especially often the F1-boutons form axosomatic synapses, whilst the F2-terminals end mainly on dendrites. The DCV-boutons contain a mixed population of clear round synaptic vesicles and large dense core vesicles. The DCV-boutons terminate mainly on spines and small distal dendrites by means of asymmetrical synaptic specializations. The d-profiles originate from dendrites, and are identical to the thalamic d-profiles but are far more rarely observed in the ICc. The d-profiles are postsynaptic mainly to the LR-types, and are presynaptic to conventional dendrites, thus participating in synaptic triads. The axonal hillocks and the initial axonal segments of the larger perikarya in the ICc are substantially inervated mainly by LR and P-boutons. Glomerulus-like formations are fairly often, especially around the LR1-terminals, contacting several small postsynaptic targets. True synaptic glomeruli are only rarely observed. Branching myelinated axons are found mainly within the fibrodendritic laminae, whilst unmyelinated collaterals, emitted by myelinated axons are especially often encountered outside the laminae.

However, until now, there has been little evidence that the caudate nucleus plays a role in smooth pursuit eye movements. In the present study, we physiologically identified the smooth pursuit subregion of the frontal eye field (FEFsem) and the saccadic subregion of the frontal eye field (FEFsac) in four Cebus monkeys. Anterogradely transported tracers (biotinylated dextran amines and wheat germ aglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) were then used to determine the efferent connections of the FEFsem to the caudate nucleus and to compare those connections with projections arising in the FEFsac. We observed dense projections from the FEFsem to the head and body of the caudate. The FEFsem and FEFsac terminal fields were of approximately equal density and total area. The region of FEFsem-labeled axon terminals overlapped only slightly with the region of FEFsac-labeled terminals. These results suggest that the caudate nucleus may play an important role in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements via feedback loops involving the basal ganglia and thalamus. Our results further suggest that the basal ganglia circuitry concerned with controlling visual pursuit is physically segregated from that concerned with controlling saccadic eye movements.","Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Anat, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA","University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center","Lynch, JC (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Anat, 2500 N State St, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.","jclynch@anatomy.umsmed.edu",,,,,,,52,51,54,0,4,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Our studies of vertical connections reveal a remarkable specificity in the laminar arrangement of the projections from layer IV to layer III that establishes three parallel intracortical pathways. The pathways that emerge from layer IV are not simple continuations of parallel thalamocortical pathways. Layer IV and its connections with layer II/III restructure the inputs from the LGN, combining the activity from ON and OFF channels and from the left and right eye and transmit the products of this synthesis to separate strata within the overlying layers. In addition, studies of two other prominent vertical connection pathways, the projections from layer VI to layer IV and from layer II/III to layer V suggest that the parallel nature of these systems is perpetuated throughout the cortical depth. Our studies of horizontal connections have revealed a systematic relationship between a neuron's orientation preference and the distribution of its axon arbor across the cortical map of visual space. Horizontal connections in layer II/III extend for greater distances and give rise to a greater number of terminals along an axis of the visual field map that corresponds to the neuron's preferred orientation. These findings suggest that the contribution of horizontal inputs to the response properties of layer II/III neurons is likely to be greater in regions of visual space that lie along the axis of preferred orientation (endzones) than along the orthogonal axis (side zones). Topographically aligned horizontal connections may contribute to the orientation preference of layer II/III neurons and could account for the axial specificity of some receptive field surround effects. Together, these results emphasize that specificity in the spatial arrangement of local circuit axon arbors plays an important role in shaping the response properties of neurons in visual cortex.",,,"Fitzpatrick, D (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT NEUROBIOL,BOX 3209,DURHAM,NC 27710, USA.",,,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY06661, EY06821] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,77,165,165,1,6,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

These cannabinoid receptors have been well characterized in rodent and monkey retinae. Here, we investigated the expression and localization of the eCB system beyond the retina, namely the first thalamic relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), of vervet monkeys using immunohistochemistry methods. Our results show that CB1R is expressed throughout the dLGN with more prominent labeling in the magnocellular layers. The same pattern is observed for the degradation enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). However, the synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is expressed homogenously throughout the dLGN with no preference for any of the layers. These proteins are weakly expressed in the koniocellular layers. These results suggest that the presence of the eCB system throughout the layers of the dLGN may represent a novel site of neuro-modulatory action in normal vision. The larger amount of CB1R in the dLGN magnocellular layers may explain some of the behavioral effects of cannabinoids associated with the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway that plays a role in visual-spatial localization and motion perception.

Three patients had progressive cognitive and behavioral changes; however, one had acute onset. Neuroimaging revealed white matter abnormalities characterized by symmetric, bilateral, T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense Magnetic Resonance Imaging signal involving frontal lobe white matter in all patients. Extensive laboratory investigations were negative apart from abnormalities in some mitochondrial enzymes and immunologic parameters. Autopsies demonstrated severe leukodystrophy with myelin and axonal loss, axonal spheroids and macrophages with early and severe frontal white matter involvement. The extent and degree of changes outside the frontal lobe appeared to correlate with disease duration.

We used functional MRI to investigate the neural representation of cross-modal matching between tactile and visual shape information in eleven normal volunteers. During the scan, patterns of 2D shapes were presented both tactually and visually, simultaneously. Four different matching tasks were performed: tactile-tactile with eyes closed (TT), tactile-tactile with visual input (TTv), visual-visual with tactile input (VVt), and tactile-visual (TV). The TT task activated the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, and the postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobules, anterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus, secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, dorsal premotor area, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area bilaterally, without occipital involvement. Visual matching activated the primary visual cortex and the lingual and fusiform gyri bilaterally. A cross-modal area was identified by subtracting TTv images from TV images, subtracting VVt images from TV images, and then determining common active areas. There was one discrete area that was active bilaterally; the posterior intraparietal sulcus close to the parieto-occipital sulcus. These data suggest that shape information from different sensory modalities may be integrated in the posterior intraparietal sulcus during tactile-visual matching tasks.

Part of the tectofugal pathway, the ectostriatum receives a large ascending thalamic input from the nucleus rotundus, the homolog of the mammalian pulvinar complex. We investigated the effects of bilateral lesions of the ectostriatum in pigeons on visual motion and spatial-pattern perception tasks. To test motion perception, we measured performance on a task requiring detection of coherently moving random dots embedded in dynamic noise. To test spatial-pattern perception, we measured performance on the detection of a square wave grating embedded in static noise. A double dissociation was revealed. Pigeons with lesions to the caudal ectostriatum showed a performance deficit on the motion task but not the grating task. In contrast, pigeons with lesions to the rostral ectostriatum showed a performance deficit on the grating task but not the motion task. Thus, in the avian telencephalon, there is a separation of visual motion and spatial-pattern perception as there is in the mammalian telencephalon. However, this separation of function is in the targets of the tectofugal pathway in pigeons rather than in the thalamofugal pathway as described in mammals. The implications of these findings with respect to the evolution of the visual system are discussed. Specifically, we suggest that the principle of parallel visual streams originated in the tectofugal pathway rather than the thalamofugal pathway.","Univ Alberta, Dept Psychol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Alberta, Div Neurosci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","University of Alberta; University of Alberta","Wylie, DRW (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Psychol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.","dwylie@ualberta.ca","Hurd, Peter L/A-4342-2009","Hurd, Peter L/0000-0002-4389-0846",,,,,76,78,79,0,8,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the patterns of activity in cMRF neurons during head unrestrained gaze shifts. Two types of cMRF neurons were found: presaccadic neurons began to discharge before the onset of gaze movements, while postsaccadic neurons began to discharge after gaze shift onset and typically after the end of the gaze shift. Presaccadic neuronal responses were well correlated with gaze movements, while the discharge of postsaccadic neurons was more closely associated with head movements. The activity of presaccadic neurons was organized into gaze movement fields, while the activity of postsaccadic neurons was better organized into movement fields associated with head displacement. We found that cMRF neurons displayed both open and closed movement field responses. Neurons with closed movement fields discharged before a specific set of gaze (presaccadic) or head (postsaccadic) movement amplitudes and directions and had a clear distal boundary. Neurons with open movement fields discharged for gaze or head movements of a specific direction and also for movement amplitudes up to the limit of measurement (70 degrees). A subset of open movement field neurons displayed an increased discharge with increased gaze shift amplitudes, similar to pontine burst neurons, and were called monotonically increasing open movement field neurons. In contrast, neurons with non-monotonically open movement fields demonstrated activity for all gaze shift amplitudes, but their activity reached a plateau or declined gradually for gaze shifts beyond specific amplitudes. We suggest that presaccadic neurons with open movement fields participate in a descending pathway providing gaze signals to medium-lead burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation, while presaccadic closed movement field neurons may participate in feedback to the superior colliculus. The previously unrecognized group of postsaccadic cMRF neurons may provide signals of head position or velocity to the thalamus, cerebellum, or spinal cord.","Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Neurol, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Neurosci, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; McGill Univ, Aerosp Med Res Unit, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada; McGill Univ, Montreal Neurobiol Inst, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada","University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; McGill University; McGill University","Waitzman, DM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Neurol, 263 Farmington Ave,MC 3974, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.","waitzman@nso2.uchc.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY-09481] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS43960-01, NS41224] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,68,20,20,0,0,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

The role of the cerebellum in these human functions has tended to be obscured by the traditional preoccupation with the motor functions of the cerebellum, which have been widely observed in other vertebrates as well. In the human brain, some phylogenetically new parts evolved and enlarged in the cerebellum, concomitantly with the enlargement of association areas in the cerebral cortex. Anatomical evidence and behavioral evidence combine to suggest that this enlarged cerebellum contributes not only to motor function but also to some sensory, cognitive, linguistic, and emotional aspects of behavior. The anatomical evidence derives from the modularity of the cerebellum, whose cortical nerve cells are organized into longitudinal micro-modules, which are arrayed perpendicular to the cortical surface and parallel to each other. The number of these micro-modules increased when the cerebellum enlarged, which enlarged the computing capabilities of the network. (From principles underlying the processing of information, it is known that when modules with modest processing capabilities are assembled in large numbers in parallel, the resulting network can achieve remarkably powerful computing capabilities.) Such cerebellar computing capabilities can be utilized in the different areas of the cerebral cortex to which the cerebellum sends signals. The cerebellar output connections convey signals through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex in segregated channels of communication, which preserve the modularity of the cerebellum. Through these channels, modules in the lateral cerebellum can send signals to new cognitive and language areas of the cerebral cortex, such as Broca's area in the prefrontal cortex. The anatomy of the human cerebro-cerebellar system therefore suggests that the cerebellum can contribute to the learning not only of motor skills but also of some cognitive and language skills. Supporting this anatomical evidence is the mounting behavioral evidence, obtained both in normal brains and in clinical studies, which indicates that the lateral cerebellum is indeed involved in some cognitive and language functions.","CHANNING HOUSE, PALO ALTO, CA 94301 USA; GOOD SAMARITAN HOSP, ROBERT S DOW NEUROL SCI INST, PORTLAND, OR 97210 USA",,,,,,,,,,172,316,321,0,23,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0166-4328","1872-7549",,"BEHAV BRAIN RES","Behav.

To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few strong but many weak excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.","Newcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; ETH, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Newcastle University - UK; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Binzegger, T (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Henry Wellcome Bldg Neuroecol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.","tom.binzegger@ncl.ac.uk",,,"Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,83,573,578,0,27,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Using multi-electrode arrays positioned in cat V1 and a broadband stimulus, we show that there is also a distinct class with positive-spiking (PS) waveforms. PS units were associated mainly with non-oriented receptive fields while RS and FS units had orientation-selective receptive fields. We suggest that PS units are recordings of axons originating from the thalamus. This conclusion was reinforced by our finding that we could record PS units after cortical silencing, but not record RS and FS units. The importance of our findings is that we were able to correlate spike shapes with receptive field characteristics with high precision using multi-electrode extracellular recording techniques. This allows considerable increases in the amount of information that can be extracted from future cortical experiments. Extracellular spike waveforms from recordings in the visual cortex have been classified into either regular-spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS) units. While both these types of spike waveforms are negative-dominant, we show that there are also distinct classes of spike waveforms in visual Area 17/18 (V1) of anaesthetised cats with positive-dominant waveforms, which are not regularly reported. The spatial receptive fields (RFs) of these different spike waveform types were estimated, which objectively revealed the existence of oriented and non-oriented RFs. We found that units with positive-dominant spikes, which have been associated with recordings from axons in the literature, had mostly non-oriented RFs (84%), which are similar to the centre-surround RFs observed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Thus, we hypothesise that these positive-dominant waveforms may be recordings from dLGN afferents. We recorded from V1 before and after the application of muscimol (a cortical silencer) and found that the positive-dominant spikes (PS) remained while the RS and FS cells did not. We also noted that the PS units had spiking characteristics normally associated with dLGN units (i.e. higher response spike rates, lower response latencies and higher proportion of burst spikes). Our findings show quantitatively that it is possible to correlate the RF properties of cortical neurons with particular spike waveforms. This has implications for how extracellular recordings should be interpreted and complex experiments can now be contemplated that would have been very challenging previously, such as assessing the feedforward connectivity between brain areas in the same location of cortical tissue.","[Sun, Shi H.; Almasi, Ali; Yunzab, Molis; Ibbotson, Michael R.; Meffin, Hamish] Australian Coll Optometry, Natl Vis Res Inst, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Zehra, Syeda; Hicks, Damien G.; Kameneva, Tatiana] Swinburne Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Hicks, Damien G.] Swinburne Univ, Opt Sci Ctr, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Ibbotson, Michael R.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Zehra, Syeda; Kameneva, Tatiana; Meffin, Hamish] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biomed Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne","Ibbotson, MR (corresponding author), Australian Coll Optometry, Natl Vis Res Inst, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.","mibbotson@nvri.org.au","Hicks, Damien G/B-5042-2015; Ibbotson, Michael R/C-9305-2009","Hicks, Damien G/0000-0001-8322-9983; Ibbotson, Michael R/0000-0002-3803-6653; Meffin, Hamish/0000-0003-4307-6841; Sun, Shi Hai/0000-0002-0221-1691","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function [CE140100007]; National Health and Medical Research Council [GNT1106390]; Lions Club of Victoria","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function(Australian Research Council); National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Lions Club of Victoria","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function (CE140100007), the National Health and Medical Research Council (GNT1106390), and the Lions Club of Victoria.",,89,11,11,1,9,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3751","1469-7793",,"J PHYSIOL-LONDON","J.

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus combined with a conventional tracer, we identified direct and polysynaptic pathways to two PPC areas, the rostral medial intraparietal area (MIP) and the ventral part of the lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) in macaque monkeys. We found that rostral MIP and LIPv receive ascending vestibular pathways, and putative efference copy inputs disynaptically from the medullary medial reticular formation (MRF) where reticulospinal pathways to neck and arm motoneurons originate. LIPv receives minor disynaptic vestibular inputs, and substantial projections from the head movement-related rostral MRF, consistent with head gain modulation of LIPv activity and a role in planning gaze shifts. Rostral MIP is the target of prominent disynaptic pathways from reaching- and head movement-related MRF domains, and major ascending vestibular pathways trisynaptically from both labyrinths, explaining prominent vestibular responses and discrimination between active and passive movements demonstrated in rostral MIP and in the neighboring ventral intraparietal area, which are heavily interconnected. The findings that rostral MIP (belonging to the 'parietal reach region'), receives vestibular inputs as directly as classical vestibular areas, via a parallel channel, and efference copy signals pathways from MRF reticulospinal domains that belong to reach and head movement networks have important implications for the understanding of the role of the PPC in updating body representations and internal models for online guidance of movement.","[Ugolini, Gabriella; Prevosto, Vincent] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Paris Saclay Inst Neurosci UMR9197, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Prevosto, Vincent] Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC USA; [Prevosto, Vincent] Duke Univ, Duke Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC USA; [Graf, Werner] Howard Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington, DC 20059 USA","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Duke University; Howard University","Ugolini, G (corresponding author), Paris Saclay Inst Neurosci UMR9197, Bat 32 CNRS,1 Av Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.","gabriella.ugolini@inaf.cnrs-gif.fr",,"Prevosto, Vincent/0000-0001-8803-5918","European Union Grant EU 5th FP [QLRT-2001-00151]","European Union Grant EU 5th FP","European Union Grant EU 5th FP, Grant/Award Number: QLRT-2001-00151, EUROKINESIS",,146,3,3,1,3,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.

In primates, most of the retinal ganglion cells that project to the LGN belong to one of two classes, P and M, whose axons terminate in the parvocellular or magnocellular subdivisions of the LGN. These cell classes give rise to two channels that have been distinguished anatomically, physiologically and behaviourally1-3,16,17. The visual cortex also can be subdivided into two pathways, one specialized for motion processing and the other for colour and form information4. Several lines of indirect evidence have suggested a close correspondence between the subcortical and cortical pathways, such that the M channel provides input to the motion pathway and the P channel drives the colour/form pathway5-7. This hypothesis was tested directly by selectively inactivating either the magnocellular or parvocellular subdivision of the LGN and recording the effects on visual responses in the cortex. We have previously reported that, in accordance with the hypothesis, responses in the motion pathway in the cortex depend primarily on magnocellular LGN8. We now report that in the colour/form pathway, visual responses depend on both P and M input. These results argue against a simple correspondence between the subcortical and cortical pathways.","UNIV ROCHESTER,DEPT PHYSIOL,ROCHESTER,NY 14642; UNIV ROCHESTER,CTR VISUAL SCI,ROCHESTER,NY 14642","University of Rochester; University of Rochester",,,"Maunsell, John/G-5702-2010","Maunsell, John/0000-0003-0018-4439; Ferrera, Vincent/0000-0002-6599-7740",,,,,17,142,144,0,13,"MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD","LONDON","PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW","0028-0836",,,"NATURE","Nature","AUG 27",1992,358,6389,,,,,756,758,,"10.1038/358756a0","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/358756a0"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/358756a0"")",,,3,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","JK699",1508271,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1992JK69900053","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1992JK69900053"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

In the LGN, PV, CR, and CB immunoreactivity was present in all laminae, slightly stronger in the magnocellular than in the parvocellular laminae for CB and CR. PV-ir puncta, representing transversally cut axons, and CR-ir fibers were revealed within the laminae and interlaminar zones, and just beyond the outer border of lamina 6 in the geniculate capsule. In the optic radiation both PV- and CR-immunoreactive neurons, puncta, and fibers were present. CB immunoreactivity was revealed in neurons of all laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus, including S lamina and interlaminar zones. There were hardly any CB-ir puncta or fibers in the laminae, interlaminar zones, geniculate capsule, or optic radiation. In the lateral inferior pulvinar, immunoreactive neurons for the three calcium-binding proteins were present in smaller number than in the LGN, as well as PV-ir puncta and CR-ir fibers within the nucleus and in the pulvinar capsule. In the white matter underlying area 17, fibers intermingled with a few scattered neurons were stained for both PV and CR, but very rarely for CB. These fibers stopped at the limit between areas 17 and 18. Area 17 showed a dense plexus of PV-ir puncta and neurons in the thalamo-receptive layer IV and CR-ir puncta and neurons both in the superficial layers I-II, IIIC, and in layer VA. Cajal-Retzius CR-ir neurons were present in layer I. CB-ir puncta were almost confined to layer I-III and CB-ir neurons to layer II. Finally the superior colliculus exhibited mostly populations of PV and CR pyramidal-like immunoreactive neurons, mainly in the intermediate tier.

The PET images were registered with magnetic resonance images from each subject so that increases in rCBF could be localized with anatomical precision in individual subjects. Increased neural activity was examined in relation to the hand used to reach, irrespective of field of reach (hand effect), and the effects of target field of reach, irrespective of hand used (field effect). A separate analysis on intersubject, averaged PET data was also performed. A comparison of the results of tile two analyses showed close correspondence in the areas of activation that were identified. We did not find a strict segregation of regions associated exclusively with either hand or field. Overall, significant rCBF increases in the hand sind field conditions occurred bilaterally in the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, cuneus, lingual gyrus, superior temporal cortex, insular cortex, thalamus, and putamen. Primary motor cortex, postcentral gyrus, and the superior parietal lobule (intraparietal sulcus) showed predominantly a contralateral hand effect, whereas the inferior parietal lobule showed this effect for the left hand only. Greater contralateral responses for the right hand were observed in the secondary motor areas. Only the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices exhibited strong ipsilateral hand effects, Field of reach was more com monly associated with bilateral patterns of activation in the areas with contralateral or ipsilateral hand effects, These results suggest that the Visual and motor components of reaching may have a different functional organization and that many brain regions represent both limb of reach and field of reach. However, since posterior parietal cortex is connected with all of these regions, we suggest that it plays a crucial role in the integration of limb and field coordinates.","NINCDS, HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL SECT, MED NEUROL BRANCH, NIH, BETHESDA, MD 20891 USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)",,,"Zeffiro, Thomas/AAE-3441-2019","Zeffiro, Thomas/0000-0002-0846-4577",,,,,90,130,130,0,4,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Each pathway possesses a functionally distinct role for action selection. The current study quantified and compared the structural connectivity between 17 distinct cortical areas with the STN and STR using 7 Tesla diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in healthy young subjects. The selection of these cortical areas was based on a literature search focusing on animal tracer studies. The results indicate that, relative to other cortical areas, both the STN and STR showed markedly weaker structural connections to areas assumed to be essential for action inhibition such as the inferior frontal cortex pars opercularis. Additionally, the cortical connectivity fingerprint of the STN and STR indicated relatively strong connections to areas related to voluntary motor initiation such as the cingulate motor area and supplementary motor area. Overall the results indicated that the cortical-STN connections were sparser compared to the STR. There were two notable exceptions, namely for the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, where a higher tract strength was found for the STN.

This interplay may be critical for likelihood of developing depressive episodes, at least in a subgroup of sensitive individuals. The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) indexes central serotonergic tonus, which may be related to endogenous sex-steroid levels in the mentally healthy state even though this remains elusive. Here we evaluate if peripheral levels of estradiol and testosterone are associated with 5-HT4R binding as imaged by [C-11]SB207145 positron emission tomography in a group of 41 healthy men. We estimated global 5-HT4R binding using a latent variable model framework, which models shared correlation between 5-HT4R across multiple brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, posterior and anterior cingulate, thalamus, pallidostriatum and neocortex). We tested whether testosterone and estradiol predict global 5-HT4R, adjusting for age. We found that testosterone, but not estradiol, correlated negatively with global 5-HT4R levels (p = 0.02) suggesting that men with high levels of testosterone have higher cerebral serotonergic tonus. Our findings corroborate the link between sex hormone levels and serotonin signalling. Future longitudinal studies in clinical relevant populations are needed to elucidate the potential importance of testosterone in the pathophysiology of e.g. major depression and its treatment.

In this study, we used two rs-fMRI measures to investigate the changes in brain function activity in DYS and their correlations with dysphagia severity. MethodIn this study, a total of 22 patients with DYS were compared with 30 patients without dysphagia (non-DYS) and matched for baseline characteristics. Then, rs-fMRI scans were performed in both groups, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated in both groups. The two-sample t-test was used to compare ReHo and fALFF between the groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the correlations between the ReHo and fALFF of the abnormal brain regions and the scores of the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), the Standardized Bedside Swallowing Assessment (SSA), the Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS), and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). ResultsCompared with the non-DYS group, the DYS group showed decreased ReHo values in the left thalamus, the left parietal lobe, and the right temporal lobe and significantly decreased fALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. In the DYS group, the ReHo of the right temporal lobe was positively correlated with the SSA score and the PAS score (r = 0.704, p < 0.001 and r = 0.707, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with the VFSS score (r = -0.741, p < 0.001). The ReHo of the left parietal lobe was positively correlated with SSA and PAS (r = 0.621, p = 0.002 and r = 0.682, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with VFSS (r = -0.679, p = 0.001). ConclusionThe changes in the brain function activity of these regions are related to dysphagia severity. The DYS group with high ReHo values in the right temporal and left parietal lobes had severe dysphagia.","[Li, Lei] Jinan Univ, Zhuhai Peoples Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiayu] Peking Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Peoples Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Fenxiong; Chen, Haidong; Zhan, Rungen; Zhao, Shengli; Peng, Yongjun] Jinan Univ, Zhuhai Peoples Hosp, Dept Radiol, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Tiao] Jinan Univ, Zhuhai Peoples Hosp, Dept Rehabil Med, Zhuhai, Peoples R China","Jinan University; Peking University; Jinan University; Jinan University","Peng, YJ (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Zhuhai Peoples Hosp, Dept Radiol, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Li, T (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Zhuhai Peoples Hosp, Dept Rehabil Med, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.","657955513@qq.com; sxpj2196@163.com","liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; Yu, Kun/IAP-9807-2023; wang, ya/HQZ-7558-2023; liu, jia/HKE-9796-2023; Li, Yuan/IXD-9067-2023; liu, jiajia/ISS-0316-2023; liu, jiajia/IUN-0901-2023; li, jiawei/HOA-5023-2023; Li, Jiaxi/HTS-3430-2023","Li, Jiaxi/0000-0002-8197-8590; liu, jia yu/0000-0001-6976-4568",,,,,36,3,3,2,4,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-2295",,,"FRONT NEUROL","Front.

Contextual factors, such as longer time fasting, subjective hunger, and body mass index (BMI), may increase the likelihood of overeating. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying these moderating influences on energy intake are poorly understood. Methods We conducted both categorical meta-analysis and meta-regression of factors modulating neural responses to sweet stimuli, using data from 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) articles incorporating 39 experiments (N = 995) carried out between 2006 and 2019. Results Responses to sweet stimuli were associated with increased activity in regions associated with taste, sensory integration, and reward processing. These taste-evoked responses were modulated by context. Longer fasts were associated with higher posterior cerebellar, thalamic, and striatal activity. Greater self-reported hunger was associated with higher medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum, and amygdala activity and lower posterior cerebellar activity. Higher BMI was associated with higher posterior cerebellar and insular activity. Conclusions Variations in fasting time, self-reported hunger, and BMI are contexts associated with differential sweet stimulus responses in regions associated with reward processing and homeostatic regulation. These results are broadly consistent with a hierarchical model of taste processing. Hunger, but not fasting or BMI, was associated with sweet stimulus-related OFC activity. Our findings extend existing models of taste processing to include posterior cerebellar regions that are associated with moderating effects of both state (fast length and self-reported hunger) and trait (BMI) variables.","[Chen, Eunice Y.] Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, TEDP Temple Eating Disorders Program, 1701 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Zeffiro, Thomas A.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore","Chen, EY (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, TEDP Temple Eating Disorders Program, 1701 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.","Eunice.Chen@temple.edu",,"Zeffiro, Thomas/0000-0002-0846-4577; Chen, Eunice/0000-0002-9288-7133",,,,,116,20,20,0,4,"SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","0307-0565","1476-5497",,"INT J OBESITY","Int.

The extrastriate area MT [V5 (hMT+) in humans] located in the 'dorsal pathway' of the primate brain is specialized in the processing of visual motion information. The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of V5 (hMT+) in the control of visually guided hand movements and to identify the corresponding cortex activation implicated in the visuomotor tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Eight human subjects performed visually guided hand movements, either continuously tracking a horizontally moving target or performing ballistic tracking movements of a cursor to an eccentric stationary target while fixating a central fixation cross. The tracking movements were back-projected onto the screen using a cursor which was moved by an MRI-compatible joystick. Both conditions activated area V5 (hMT+), right more than left, particularly during continuous tracking. In addition, a large-scale sensorimotor circuit which included sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum as well as a number of cortical areas along the intraparietal sulcus in both hemispheres were activated. Because activity was increased in V5 (hMT+) during continuous tracking but not during ballistic tracking as compared to motion perception, it has a pivotal role during the visual control of forelimb movements as well.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Neurobiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Dept Neurol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, D-3400 Gottingen, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; University of Gottingen","Oreja-Guevara, C (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Neurobiol, ND 7,Postfach 102148, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.","celia.oregaguevara@ruhr-uni-bochum.de","Paulus, Walter/A-3544-2009; Oreja-Guevara, Celia/N-5151-2019","Paulus, Walter/0000-0001-5549-8377; Oreja-Guevara, Celia/0000-0002-9221-5716",,,,,50,26,26,0,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Typically, the volume of water drunk in response to thirst matches the deficit. Exactly how this accurate metering is achieved is unknown; recent evidence implicates swallowing inhibition as a potential factor. Using fMRI, this study investigated whether swallowing inhibition is present after more water has been drunk than is necessary to restore fluid balance within the body. This proposal was tested using ratings of swallowing effort and measuring regional brain responses as participants prepared to swallow small volumes of liquid while they were thirsty and after they had overdrunk. Effort ratings provided unequivocal support for swallowing inhibition, with a threefold increase in effort after overdrinking, whereas addition of 8% (wt/vol) sucrose to water had minimal effect on effort before or after overdrinking. Regional brain responses when participants prepared to swallow showed increases in the motor cortex, prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus after overdrinking, relative to thirst. Ratings of swallowing effort were correlated with activity in the right prefrontal cortex and pontine regions in the brainstem; no brain regions showed correlated activity with pleasantness ratings. These findings are all consistent with the presence of swallowing inhibition after excess water has been drunk. We conclude that swallowing inhibition is an important mechanism in the overall regulation of fluid intake in humans.","[Saker, Pascal; McKinley, Michael J.; Denton, Derek A.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Farrell, Michael J.; Egan, Gary F.] Monash Univ, Monash Biomed Imaging, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Farrell, Michael J.] Monash Univ, Monash Biomed Discovery Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Farrell, Michael J.] Monash Univ, Dept Med Imaging & Radiat Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Egan, Gary F.] Monash Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Integrat Br, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Egan, Gary F.] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Clin & Cognit Neurosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [McKinley, Michael J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Physiol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Denton, Derek A.] Univ Melbourne, Off Dean, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Denton, Derek A.] Baker Int Diabet Inst Heart & Diabet Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia","Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of Melbourne; Monash University; Monash University; Monash University; Monash University; Monash University; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne","Denton, DA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.;Farrell, MJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Biomed Imaging, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;Farrell, MJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Monash Biomed Discovery Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;Farrell, MJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Med Imaging & Radiat Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;Denton, DA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Off Dean, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.;Denton, DA (corresponding author), Baker Int Diabet Inst Heart & Diabet Inst, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.","michael.j.farrell@monash.edu; ddenton@unimelb.edu.au","Egan, Gary F./A-1381-2013; Farrell, Michael/H-4571-2019","Farrell, Michael/0000-0003-4126-8911; Egan, Gary/0000-0002-3186-4026","NIGMS NIH HHS [R35 GM118189] Funding Source: Medline","NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))",,,78,22,22,0,6,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424",,,"P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

In the retina, GABA immunoreactivity (both somata and fibers) was observed in all layers except the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Contrary to earlier reports, about 30% of total neurons within ganglion cell layer (GCL) expressed GABA immunoreactivity. Double-labeling studies indicated that about half of the GABA-containing perikarya in the GCL were retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the diencephalon, intensely labeled GABA-immunoreactive neurons and nerve fibers were observed within the neuropil of Bellonci (nB) and corpus geniculatum (CG), while only immunoreactive puncta were found in the rostral visual nucleus (RVN). In the pretectal region, the posterior thalamic nucleus (nPT) contained the most intensely labeled GABA immunoreactive perikarya and nerve fibers in the entire brain. Lightly immunoreactive perikarya were also found in the large-celled nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (nLM), as well as in the pretectal gray, which contains neurons postsynaptic to the retinal terminal zones within nLM. In the optic tectum (OT), both immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were found within superficial layers 8 and 9, whereas only densely packed immunoreactive perikarya were evident in the deep tectal layers (i.e. 2, 4, 6). The nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) contained a small number of lightly labeled GABA-immunoreactive perikarya, mostly located in the dorsal half of the nucleus. A large number of perikarya within the nucleus isthmi (NI) were also immunostained.","Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol, Neurosci & Behav Program, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Li, Z (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Mental Hlth Res Inst, 205 Zina Pitcher Pl, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,67,13,14,0,2,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA","0952-5238",,,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","NOV-DEC",1998,15,6,,,,,995,1006,,"10.1017/S0952523898155207","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523898155207"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523898155207"")",,,12,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","139QP",9839965,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000077041100001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000077041100001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Early recordings suggested that the PBN transmitted a faithful representation of taste activity from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). However, its role assumed greater significance as its subnuclei were shown to deal with different aspects of taste, visceral sensations, hedonics, and conditioned aversions. The discovery of parallel projections from PBN to the thalamus and to ventral forebrain, and evidence that the former carried sensory information while the latter signaled hedonics, conferred on PBN a central role in guiding feeding. Thus, it was surprising to discover that the PBN is not a taste relay in primates. So arose a distinction between rodents, in which parallel processing of taste and hedonic information is the rule, and primates, where serial processing through the cortex precedes a hedonic assessment. Where does the integration of taste and hedonics occur, and how does this affect feeding? Neurons in both NTS and PBN of rodents are modified by changing physiological conditions. That altered activity parallels and perhaps directs the rodent's feeding behavior. Information from primate NTS implies no such modification. These interactions are reserved for orbitofrontal cortex and ventral forebrain. The implication is that in rodents, hindbrain alterations not only control the reflexes associated with taste, but also direct food selection through the PBN-ventral forebrain projections. In primates, the apparatus is in place for an independent cognitive analysis unaltered by physiological state, upon which a hedonic assessment is subsequently overlaid.","[Scott, Thomas R.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Small, Dana M.] Yale Univ, John B Pierce Lab, New Haven, CT USA","California State University System; San Diego State University; Yale University; The John B Pierce Laboratory, Inc","Scott, TR (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.","tom.scott@sdsu.edu",,"Small, Dana/0000-0001-7363-1100",,,,,34,30,30,0,8,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXEN, ENGLAND","0077-8923",,"978-1-57331-738-2","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2009,1170,,,,,,372,377,,"10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03906.x","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03906.x"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03906.x"")",,,6,"Behavioral Sciences; Cell Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Physiology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Behavioral Sciences; Cell Biology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology","BLL92",19686161,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000270495700066","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000270495700066"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Computerized perimetry indicated a left visual field defect only although MRI and (18)FDG-PET scans showed abnormalities in both occipital lobes. The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.

We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.","[Kameda, Hiroshi; Murabe, Naoyuki; Hayashi, Toshihiro; Sakurai, Masaki] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizukami, Hiroaki; Ozawa, Keiya] Jichi Med Univ, Div Genet Therapeut, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan; [Kameda, Hiroshi; Murabe, Naoyuki; Hayashi, Toshihiro] Juntendo Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; [Ozawa, Keiya] Jichi Med Univ, Dept Immunogene & Cell Therapy Takara Bio, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan","Teikyo University; Jichi Medical University; Juntendo University; Jichi Medical University","Sakurai, M (corresponding author), Juntendo Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Neurosci, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.","msakurai@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp","Hayashi, Toshihiro/A-6028-2008","Hayashi, Toshihiro/0000-0003-4362-7439; Sakurai, Masaki/0000-0001-6729-7580","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [23300141]; Science Research Promotion Fund of the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan; Nakajima Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23300141] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Science Research Promotion Fund of the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan; Nakajima Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Dr. K.

While a number of research groups have investigated NPSLE, there remains a lack of consistent application of this diagnostic criteria within neuroimaging studies. Previous neuroimaging research suggests that SLE patients have reduced subcortical and regional gray matter volumes when compared to controls, and that these group differences may be driven by SLE patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The current study sought to compare measures of cortical thickness and subcortical structure volume between NPSLE, SLE, and healthy controls. We hypothesized that patients with NPSLE (N = 21) would have thinner cortex and reduced subcortical gray matter volumes when compared to SLE (N = 16) and control subjects (N = 21). All subjects underwent MRI examinations on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Sonata scanner. Anatomical reconstruction and segmentation were performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite. Cortical and subcortical volumes were extracted from FreeSurfer and analyzed for group differences, controlling for age. The NPSLE group exhibited decreased cortical thickness in clusters of the left frontal and parietal lobes as well as in the right parietal and occipital lobes compared to control subjects. Compared to the SLE group, the NPSLE group exhibited comparable thinning in clusters of the frontal and temporal lobes. Controlling for age, we found that between group effects for subcortical gray matter structures were significant for the thalamus (F = 3.06, p = .04), caudate nucleus (F = 3.19, p = .03), and putamen (F = 4.82, p = .005). These results clarify previous imaging work identifying cortical atrophy in a mixed SLE and NPSLE group, and suggest that neuroanatomical abnormalities are specific to SLE patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Future work should help elucidate the underlying mechanisms underlying the emerging neurobiological profile seen in NPSLE, as well as clarify the apparent lack of overlap between cortical thinning and functional activation results and other findings pointing to increased functional activation during cognitive tasks.","[Jung, Rex E.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Neurosurg, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Jung, Rex E.; Segall, Judith M.; Grazioplene, Rachael G.] Univ New Mexico, Mind Res Network, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Qualls, Clifford] Univ New Mexico, Dept Math, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Sibbitt, Wilmer L., Jr.; Roldan, Carlos A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Internal Med, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","University of New Mexico; Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute; University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico","Jung, RE (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Neurosurg, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.","rjung@salud.unm.edu","Sibbitt, Wilmer/AAI-7746-2020","Sibbitt, Wilmer/0000-0001-5872-160X; Jung, Rex/0000-0003-3718-0597","NIH-NHLBI (National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) [R01HL077422-01A1]","NIH-NHLBI (National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","Research supported by grant number R01HL077422-01A1 - NIH-NHLBI (National Institutes of Health-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute), to Carlos A.

The perception of self-motion during constant velocity movement is completely dependent on visually induced vection, This can be linear vection or circular vection (CV), CV is induced by large-field visual motion stimulation during which the stationary subject perceives the moving surroundings as being stable and himself as being moved. To determine the unknown cortical visual-vestibular interaction during CV, we conducted a PET activation study on CV in 10 human volunteers. The PET images of cortical areas activated during visual motion stimulation without CV were compared with those with CV, Hitherto, CV was explained neurophysiologically by visual-vestibular convergence with activation of the vestibular nuclei, thalamic subnuclei and vestibular cortex. If CV were mediated by the vestibular cortex, one would expect that an adequate visual motion stimulus would activate both the visual and vestibular cortex. Contrary to this expectation, it was shown for the first time that visual motion stimulation with CV not only activates a medial parieto-occipital visual area bilaterally, separate from middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas, it also simultaneously deactivates the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. There was a positive correlation between the perceived intensity of CV and relative changes in regional CBF in parietal and occipital areas. These findings support a new functional interpretation: reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction as a multisensory mechanism for self-motion perception. Inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction might protect visual perception of self-motion from potential vestibular mismatches caused by involuntary head accelerations during locomotion, and this would allow the dominant sensorial weight during self-motion perception to shift from one sensory modality to the other.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Nucl Med, D-8000 Munich, Germany","University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Munich","Brandt, T (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,37,357,362,0,28,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","SEP",1998,121,,9,,,,1749,1758,,"10.1093/brain/121.9.1749","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.9.1749"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.9.1749"")",,,10,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","125FL",9762962,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000076226700012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000076226700012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Amblyopia or lazy eye is the most common cause of uniocular blindness in adults and is caused by a disruption to normal visual development as a consequence of unmatched inputs from the two eyes in early life, arising from a turned eye (strabismus), unequal refractive error (anisometropia), or form deprivation (e.g., cataract). Using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging in a group of human adults with amblyopia, we previously demonstrated that reduced responses are observable at a thalamic level, that of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Here we investigate the selectivity of this deficit by using chromatic and achromatic stimuli that are designed to bias stimulation to one or other of the three ascending pathways (the parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular). We find the greatest LGN deficit is for stimuli modulated along the chromatic, L/M cone opponent axis of color space, suggesting a selective loss of parvocellular function in the LGN. We also demonstrate a cortical deficit that involves all the visual areas studied (V1, V2, V3, VP, V3A, V4), and we find this is greatest for the two chromatic responses (S cone opponent and L/M cone opponent) versus the achromatic response, as might be expected from a loss of segregation of chromatic pathways in the cortex.","[Hess, Robert F.; Thompson, Benjamin; Mullen, Kathy T.] McGill Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada; [Thompson, Benjamin] Univ Auckland, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Gole, Glen A.] Univ Queensland, Royal Childrens Hosp, Discipline Paediat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","McGill University; University of Auckland; Royal Children's Hospital Brisbane; University of Queensland","Hess, RF (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, McGill Vis Res H4-14,687 Pine Ave W, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A1, Canada.","robert.hess@mcgill.ca","Hess, Robert F/A-5624-2008; Gole, Glen A/F-4219-2010; Mullen, Kathy T/A-5401-2008","Gole, Glen A/0000-0001-7285-2702; Thompson, Benjamin/0000-0002-3902-2712","Canadian Institute of Health Research [MOP-53346, MOP-10819]; Wesley Institute Research","Canadian Institute of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Wesley Institute Research","This work was supported by a Canadian Institute of Health Research Grants MOP-53346 to R.

Here, we review recent studies of the human LGN that have investigated the retinotopic organization, physiologic response properties, and modulation of neural activity by selective attention and by visual awareness in a binocular rivalry paradigm. In the retinotopy studies, we found that the contralateral visual field was represented with the lower field in the medial-superior portion and the upper field in the lateral-inferior portion of each LGN. The fovea was represented in posterior and superior portions, with increasing eccentricities represented more anteriorly. Functional MRI responses increased monotonically with stimulus contrast in the LGN and in visual cortical areas. In the LGN, the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the cortex. In our attention studies, we found that directed attention to a spatial location modulated neural activity in the LGN in several ways: it enhanced neural responses to attended stimuli, attenuated responses to ignored stimuli, and increased baseline activity in the absence of visual stimulation. Furthermore, we showed in a binocular rivalry paradigm that neural activity in the LGN correlated strongly with the subjects' reported percepts. The overall view that emerges from these studies is that the human LGN plays a role in perception and cognition far beyond that of a relay nucleus and, rather, needs to be considered as an early gatekeeper in the control of visual attention and awareness.","Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Princeton University","Kastner, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Dept Psychol, Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","skastner@princeton.edu",,"Schneider, Keith/0000-0001-7120-3380; Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X","NIMH NIH HHS [P50 MH-62196, T32 MH-065214, R01 MH-64043] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,104,52,53,0,13,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0079-6123",,"978-0-444-51927-6","PROG BRAIN RES","Prog.

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus is the source of visual signals to the primary visual cortex (V1). Most large-scale cortical network models approximate the spike trains of LGN neurons as simple Poisson point processes. However, many studies have shown that neurons in the early visual pathway are capable of spiking with high temporal precision and their discharges are not Poisson-like. To gain an understanding of how response variability in the LGN influences the behavior of V1, we study response properties of model V1 neurons that receive purely feedforward inputs from LGN cells modeled either as noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) neurons or as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We first demonstrate that the NLIF model is capable of reproducing many experimentally observed statistical properties of LGN neurons. Then we show that a V1 model in which the LGN input to a V1 neuron is modeled as a group of NLIF neurons produces higher orientation selectivity than the one with Poisson LGN input. The second result implies that statistical characteristics of LGN spike trains are important for V1's function. We conclude that physiologically motivated models of V1 need to include more realistic LGN spike trains that are less noisy than inhomogeneous Poisson processes.","[Lin, I-Chun; Xing, Dajun; Shapley, Robert] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA","New York University","Lin, IC (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.","icl231@nyu.edu; xdj@cns.nyu.edu; shapley@cns.nyu.edu","Xing, Dajun/F-4217-2011; Lin, I-Chun/A-7010-2009",,"National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; Swartz Foundation","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swartz Foundation","We thank E.

The basis of its dominance is less clear. We have tested 16 left hemisphere (LH) patients, 17 right hemisphere (RH) patients and 12 neurologically normal controls on a battery of five tasks. The tasks were based on animal lesion and recording studies, and human imaging and magnetic stimulation studies that identified two distributed systems that are important for the selection of motor responses and object-oriented responses. The LH patients were impaired on three response selection tasks: learning to select between joystick movement responses instructed by visual cues; learning to select between analogous object-oriented responses instructed by visual cues; learning to select movements in a sequence. Although we replicated the finding that LH damage impairs sequencing, some of the impaired tasks had no sequencing element. We therefore argue that the LH deficits are best explained as an impairment of response selection. This was confirmed by showing that LH subjects were unimpaired on a more demanding task-object discrimination learning-which imposed a greater memory load but had no response selection element. Moreover, the LH deficits could not be attributed to disorganization of movement kinematics. The lesions of the impaired LH group were widespread but always included the distributed systems known to be important for response selection-the dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortices, striatum, thalamus and white matter fascicles.

Data were obtained for three object weights (4, 200 and 600 g) and a resting condition. Grip and lift forces on a similar object and the activity of selected;muscles in the hand, arm and shoulder were also recorded in separate lifting trials. A comparison between all movement conditions and the resting condition revealed significant activation of the primary motor (M1), primary sensory (S1), dorso-caudal premotor (PM), caudal supplementary motor (SMA) and cingulate motor (CMA) cortices contralateral to the hand used. On the ipsilateral side. activation of the M1, caudal SMA and inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) was also found. In the subcortical areas, the bilateral hemispheres and right vermis of the cerebellum, left basal ganglia and thalamus were activated. Behavioral adaptation to a heavier object weight was revealed in a nearly proportional increase of both grip and lift forces, prolonged force application period and a higher level of hand and arm muscle activities. An increase in the rCBF associated with these changes was noted in several cortical and subcortical areas. However, consistent object weight-dependent activation was observed only in the M1/S1 contralateral to the hand used. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Previous neural models propose how maps of orientation (OR), ocular dominance (OR), and related properties develop in V1. These models show how spontaneous activity, before eye opening, combined with correlation learning and competition, can generate maps similar to those found in vivo. These models have not discussed laminar architecture or how cells develop and coordinate their connections across cortical layers. This is an important problem since anatomical evidence shows that clusters of horizontal connections form, between iso-oriented regions, in layer 2/3 before being innervated by layer 4 afferents. How are orientations in different layers aligned before these connections form? Anatomical evidence demonstrates that thalamic afferents wait in the subplate for weeks before innervating layer 4. Other evidence shows that ablation of the cortical subplate interferes with the development of OR and OD columns. The model proposes how the subplate develops OR and OD maps, which then entrain and coordinate the development of maps in other lamina. The model demonstrates how these maps may develop in layer 4 by using a known transient subplate-to-layer 4 circuit as a teacher. The model subplate also guides the early clustering of horizontal connections in layer 2/3, and the formation of the interlaminar circuitry that forms cortical columns. It is shown how layer 6 develops and helps to stabilize the network when the subplate atrophies. Finally the model clarifies how brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) manipulations may influence cortical development.","Boston Univ, Dept Cognit & Neural Syst, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Grossberg, S (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Cognit & Neural Syst, 677 Beacon St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","steve@bu.edu",,,,,,,127,57,58,0,11,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

The rostrotemporal auditory cortical area (RT) remains the least well characterized of the three proposed core areas, and its functional organization has only recently come under scrutiny. Here we used injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to examine the connectivity of RT and its adjacent areas. As expected from the current model, RT exhibited dense core-like reciprocal connectivity with the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, the rostral core area and the auditory belt, but had weaker connections with the parabelt. However, RT also projected to the ipsilateral rostromedial prefrontal cortex (area 10), the dorsal temporal pole and the ventral caudate nucleus, as well as bilaterally to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Thus, RT has connectivity with limbic structures previously believed to connect only with higher-order auditory association cortices, and is probably functionally distinct from the other core areas. While this view is consistent with a proposed role of RT in temporal integration, our results also indicate that RT could provide an anatomical 'shortcut' for processing affective content in auditory information.","[Reser, David H.; Burman, Kathleen J.; Richardson, Karyn E.; Rosa, Marcello G.

One prevalent hypothesis to account for this discrepancy is that posterior cingulate hypometabolism results from disconnection from the hippocampus through disruption of the cingulum bundle. However, only partial and indirect evidence currently supports this hypothesis. Thus, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 18 patients with early AD, we assessed the relationships between hippocampal atrophy, white matter integrity, and gray matter metabolism by means of a whole-brain voxel-based correlative approach. We found that hippocampal atrophy is specifically related to cingulum bundle disruption, which is in turn highly correlated to hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex but also of the middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (all part of Papez's circuit), as well as the right temporoparietal associative cortex. These results provide the first direct evidence supporting the disconnection hypothesis as a major factor contributing to the early posterior hypometabolism in AD. Disruption of the cingulum bundle also appears to relate to hypometabolism in a large connected network over and above the posterior cingulate cortex, encompassing the whole memory circuit of Papez (consistent with the key location of this white matter tract within this loop) and also, but indirectly, the right posterior association cortex.","[Viader, Fausto; de la Sayette, Vincent] CHU Cote Nacre, Dept Neurol, F-14033 Caen, France; [Baron, Jean-Claude] Univ Cambridge, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Unit, Cambridge CB2 2SP, England; [Villain, Nicolas; Desgranges, Beatrice; Viader, Fausto; de la Sayette, Vincent; Mezenge, Florence; Landeau, Brigitte; Eustache, Francis; Chetelat, Gael] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CHU Cote Nacre, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Groupement Interet Publ Cyceron,INSERM,Unite U923, F-14074 Caen, France","CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Universite de Caen Normandie; University of Cambridge; CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Caen Normandie","Chetelat, G (corresponding author), Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CHU Cote Nacre, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Groupement Interet Publ Cyceron,INSERM,Unite U923, Blvd H Becquerel,BP 5229, F-14074 Caen, France.","chetelat@cyceron.fr","Chetelat, Gael/G-2316-2015; de la Sayette, Vincent/L-8074-2015; DESGRANGES, BEATRICE/AAK-4756-2021; Desgranges, Béatrice/L-7739-2015; Eustache, Francis/J-9465-2015; Kennedy, Kristen M/B-4699-2008; Villain, Nicolas/E-6475-2012","DESGRANGES, BEATRICE/0000-0002-3657-9996; Eustache, Francis/0000-0003-4460-8686; Kennedy, Kristen M/0000-0001-5373-9026; Villain, Nicolas/0000-0002-7429-4289; Gael, Chetelat/0000-0002-4889-7932; baron, jean-claude/0000-0002-5264-2588; baron, claude/0000-0001-9573-7002",,,,,63,284,289,1,34,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

In contrast, almost nothing is known about the circuitry or laminar features of multisensory processing in higher order, multisensory cortex. Therefore, using the ferret higher order multisensory rostral posterior parietal (PPr) cortex, the present investigation employed a combination of multichannel recording and neuroanatomical techniques to elucidate the laminar basis of multisensory cortical processing. The proportion of multisensory neurons, the share of neurons showing multisensory integration, and the magnitude of multisensory integration were all found to differ by layer in a way that matched the functional or connectional characteristics of the PPr. Specifically, the supragranular layers (L2/3) demonstrated among the highest proportions of multisensory neurons and the highest incidence of multisensory response enhancement, while also receiving the highest levels of extrinsic inputs, exhibiting the highest dendritic spine densities, and providing a major source of local connectivity. In contrast, layer 6 showed the highest proportion of unisensory neurons while receiving the fewest external and local projections and exhibiting the lowest dendritic spine densities. Coupled with a lack of input from principal thalamic nuclei and a minimal layer 4, these observations indicate that this higher level multisensory cortex shows functional and organizational modifications from the well-known patterns identified for primary sensory cortical regions.

Previous physiological studies indicate that SGS3/SO neurons have large receptive fields and respond to small moving stimuli. We sought to better characterize the dendritic morphology of SGS3/SO neurons with intracellular filling in slice preparations of the ground squirrel superior colliculus. We found that dendrites of widefield vertical cells end in monostratified arrays of spiny terminal specializations called bottlebrush dendritic endings. Two major subtypes of neurons are described. Type I neurons have somata restricted to the SGS3 and bottlebrush endings in the most superficial sublayer of the SGS. Type II neurons are found at the base of the SGS and in the upper SO, and have bottlebrush endings arrayed within the middle sublayers of the SGS. Bottlebrush endings may sample and integrate laminated afferents to the superior colliculus, and cellular subtypes may underlie multiple information streams within the tectopulvinar pathway. A similar dendritic morphology and projection pattern can be found in cells of the avian optic tectum that project upon the nucleus rotundus, a thalamic nucleus homologous to the mammalian caudal/inferior pulvinar. Because motion processing is a dominant feature of the avian tectorotundal pathway, the current results suggest that both dendritic morphology and motion processing are conserved features of widefield vertical cells in the tectopulvinar pathway of vertebrates.

The present study investigated this hypothesis by examining the incidence of LT bursts in 146 cells recorded from the LGN of three macaque monkeys. Bursts were defined as clusters of two or more action potentials separated by not more than 4 ms and preceded by a >= 100-ms quiescent interval. The incidence of bursts was examined in several intensive-training Go-NoGo and target selection tasks as well as in training-free tasks where natural scenes with both familiar and novel contents were shown. Our chief findings were as follows. 1) Bursts occur in the majority of cells under every condition tested, 2) burst incidence is very low (< 1 burst every 10 s), 3) bursts occur in association with a receptive field stimulus on average only once every 23 times in 65% of cells tested, 4) cells responding with bursts to the stimulus also tended to exhibit higher levels of spontaneous bursting, 5) the presence of bursts did not depend on the novelty of the stimulus or its behavioral relevance. When the monkeys explored static natural scenes, 6) bursts were not correlated with short-term changes in the image sampled by the cell's receptive field during saccades. Burst incidence 7) did not increase when images were novel or when they evoked an emotional reaction, and 8) bursts did not decrease when images were familiar. 9) Bursts were not correlated with saccades in the dark, but 10) more spikes participated in bursts in the dark. Although these results confirm the occurrence of LT bursts in LGN cells of awake monkeys, they do not support the hypothesis that these bursts are a privileged means of transferring sensory information, that they signal unexpected or significant visual events, or that they are involved uniquely in the coding of natural scenes.","Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Learned Lab U3218, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Integrat Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Inst Mol Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Univ Szeged, Dept Physiol, Szeged, Hungary","Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Szeged University","Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Learned Lab U3218, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.","vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu",,,"NEI NIH HHS [EY-08890, EY-08126, EY-01778] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD-15052] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [1F31NS-44691] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,44,18,20,0,4,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Structural magnetic resonance studies indicate that brain abnormalities are present at onset, but longitudinal studies to assess neuroprogression have been limited by small samples and short or infrequent follow-up intervals. Methods: The Iowa Longitudinal Study is a prospective study of 542 first-episode patients who have been followed up to 18 years. In this report, we focus on those patients (n = 202) and control subjects (n = 125) for whom we have adequate structural magnetic resonance data (n = 952 scans) to provide a relatively definitive determination of whether progressive brain change occurs over a time interval of up to 15 years after intake. Results: A repeated-measures analysis showed significant age-by-group interaction main effects that represent a significant decrease in multiple gray matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, thalamus), multiple white matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, temporal, parietal), and a corresponding increase in cerebrospinal fluid (lateral ventricles and frontal, temporal, and parietal sulci). These changes were most severe during the early years after onset. They occur at severe levels only in a subset of patients. They are correlated with cognitive impairment but only weakly with other clinical measures. Conclusions: Progressive brain change occurs in schizophrenia, affects both gray matter and white matter, is most severe during the early stages of the illness, and occurs only in a subset of patients. Measuring severity of progressive brain change offers a promising new avenue for phenotype definition in genetic studies of schizophrenia.","[Andreasen, Nancy C.] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Carver Coll Med, Psychiat Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","University of Iowa","Andreasen, NC (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Carver Coll Med, Psychiat Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium, 200 Hawkins Dr,Room W278 GH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.","luann-godlove@uiowa.edu","Ho, Beng-Choon/D-6959-2011","Ho, Beng-Choon/0000-0003-3976-1555; Andreasen, Nancy/0000-0001-5730-9744; Magnotta, Vincent/0000-0001-8639-5354; Nopoulos, Peggy/0000-0001-8810-1903","Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses [MH43271]; Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia [5R01MH031593]; Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses [5R01MH040856]; Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging; Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis [5R01NS050568]; National Institutes of Health [MH68380]; National Association for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression","Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses; Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses; Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging; Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Association for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression","This article was written with support from the following Grants: Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses (MH43271); Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia (5R01MH031593); Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses (5R01MH040856); Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging (Magnotta K Award); and Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis (5R01NS050568).

By calculating the contrast for vestibular activation minus cutaneous activation for the group, we found activations in the anterior parts of the insula, the paramedian and dorsolateral thalamus, the putamen, the inferior parietal lobule [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the precentral gyrus (frontal eye field, BA 6), the middle frontal gyrus (prefrontal cortex, BA 46/9), the middle temporal gyrus (BA 37), the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in both cerebellar hemispheres. These activations can be attributed to multisensory vestibular and ocular motor functions. Single-subject analysis in addition showed distinctly nonoverlapping activations in the posterior insula, which corresponds to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in the monkey. During vestibular stimulation, there was also a significant signal decrease in the visual cortex (BA 18, 19), which spared BA 17. A different deactivation was found during cutaneous stimulation; it included upper parieto-occipital areas in the middle temporal and occipital gyri (BA 19/39/18). Under both stimulation conditions, there were signal decreases in the somatosensory cortex (BA 2/3/4). Stimulus-dependent, inhibitory vestibular-visual, and nociceptive-somatosensory interactions may be functionally significant for processing perception and sensorimotor control.","Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neuroradiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany","University of Munich; University of Munich","Bense, S (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.","sbense@nefo.med.uni-muenchen.de","Yousry, Tarek A/B-3417-2009",,,,,,95,325,331,0,16,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

However, whether different aspects of sequential information like interval and ordinal properties are supported by different anatomical regions, and whether the representation of sequential information within the PMC is necessarily related to motor requirements, remain open questions. Brain activations were investigated during a sequence encoding paradigm in 12 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects had to attend either to the interval or to the ordinal information of a sequence of visually presented stimuli and had to encode the relevant information either before motor reproduction or before perceptual monitoring. Although interval and ordinal information led to activations within the same neural network, direct comparisons revealed significant differences. The pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), the lateral PMC, the frontal opercular cortex as well as basal ganglia and the left lateral cerebellar cortex (CE) were activated significantly more strongly by interval information, whereas the SMA, the frontal eye field, the primary motor cortex (MI), the primary somatosensory cortex, the cuneus as well as the medial CE and the thalamus were activated more strongly by ordinal information, In addition, serial encoding before reproduction led to higher activations than serial encoding before monitoring in the preSMA, SMA, MI and medial CE.

These circuits predominantly connect primary and secondary visual cortex with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although there are direct geniculocortical inputs to extrastriate visual cortex, whether reciprocal corticogeniculate neurons exist in extrastriate cortex is not known. Here we utilized virus-mediated retrograde tracing to reveal the presence of corticogeniculate neurons in three mid-level extrastriate visual cortical areas in ferrets: PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. We observed corticogeniculate neurons in all three extrastriate areas, although the density of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons in extrastriate cortex was an order of magnitude less than that in areas 17 and 18. A cluster analysis of morphological metrics quantified following reconstructions of the full dendritic arborizations of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons revealed six distinct cell types. Similar corticogeniculate cell types to those observed in areas 17 and 18 were also observed in PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. However, these unique cell types were not equally distributed across the three extrastriate areas. The majority of corticogeniculate neurons per cluster originated in a single area, suggesting unique parallel organizations for corticogeniculate feedback from each extrastriate area to the LGN. Together, our findings demonstrate direct feedback connections from mid-level extrastriate visual cortex to the LGN, supporting complementary reciprocal circuits at multiple processing stages along the visual hierarchy. Importantly, direct reciprocal connections between the LGN and extrastriate cortex, that bypass V1, could provide a substrate for residual vision following V1 damage.","[Adusei, Matthew; Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Neurosci Grad Program, 601 Elmwood Ave Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Hasse, J.

This coincides with the arrival of parvocellular signals en route to the ventral pathway and infero-temporal cortex. Such evidence suggests that the dorsal stream region V5/MT+ is activated rapidly through the traditional hierarchical pathway and also via a less-well-established direct signal to V5/MT+ bypassing V1. To test this, 16 healthy humans underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ while performing a motion-direction detection task. A three-alternate forced-choice design (left/right motion, stationary) allowed analysis of the quality of errors made, in addition to the more usual performance measures. Transient disruption of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ significantly reduced accuracy when TMS was applied at or near motion onset. Most participants also showed disrupted performance with TMS application over V1/V2 similar to 125 ms post motion onset, and significantly reduced accuracy at 158 ms with V5/MT+ stimulation. The two periods of disruption with V1/V2 TMS are suggestive of feedforward/feedback models, although the earlier period of disruption has not been reported in previous TMS studies. Very early activation of V5/MT+, evidenced by diminished accuracy and reduced perception of motion after TMS may be indicative of a thalamic-extrastriate pathway in addition to the traditionally expected later period of processing. A profound disruption of performance prestimulus onset is more likely to reflect disruption of top-down expectancy than disruption of visual processing.","La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; Swinburne Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; Alfred & Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Psychiat & Psychol Med, Alfred Psychiat Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","La Trobe University; Swinburne University of Technology; Monash University","Laycock, R (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.","r.laycock@latrobe.edu.au","Crewther, Sheila G/A-2165-2008; Fitzgerald, Paul B/A-1225-2008","Fitzgerald, Paul B/0000-0003-4217-8096; Laycock, Robin/0000-0002-9169-2297",,,,,78,84,84,0,18,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Little is known about cuneate functional organization in primates or about how cuneate and area 3b organization are related. In this study, neurophysiologic approaches were used to evaluate how tactile inputs from the hand and adjacent body are organized in the cuneate nucleus of squirrel monkeys. Cuneate data on the organization of hand inputs were then compared with analogous area 3b data from our earlier cortical studies that used the same approaches. Evaluations of several cuneate properties, including (1) responsiveness to tactile stimulation, (2) incidences and sizes of receptive fields, (3) somatotopic progressions, (4) properties of representations, and (5) relationships between functional inputs and cytochrome oxidase staining, suggest that tactile afferents from the hand form consistently organized cuneate representations that, in turn, relate to the parcellated organization of cuneate structural substrates. Comparisons of cuneate and area 3b organization indicate that tactile processing from the brainstem to cortex involves a preservation of tactile responsiveness and somatotopic organization but, in addition, involves transformations that produce receptive field sharpening, suppression of hairy hand inputs, amplification and refinement of glabrous inputs, and relocations of representations. Ascending lemniscal substrates are characterized by cascading excitatory convergence/divergence that increments at successively higher levels between sensory afferents and area 3b. It is suggested that the observed preservations and transformations reflect this organization but, in addition, reflect mechanisms that cause counterbalancing sharpening and suppressions of hand inputs.

Neural circuit mechanisms based on neuronal and synaptic properties have been shown to process temporal information over the range of tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds(5-7). How neural circuits process temporal information in the range of seconds to minutes is much less understood. Studies of working memory in monkeys and rats have shown that neurons in the prefrontal cortex(8-10), the parietal cortex(9,11) and the thalamus(12) exhibit ramping activities that linearly correlate with the lapse of time until the end of a specific time interval of several seconds that the animal is trained to memorize. Many organisms can also memorize the time interval of rhythmic sensory stimuli in the timescale of seconds and can coordinate motor behaviour accordingly, for example, by keeping the rhythm after exposure to the beat of music. Here we report a form of rhythmic activity among specific neuronal ensembles in the zebrafish optic tectum, which retains the memory of the time interval ( in the order of seconds) of repetitive sensory stimuli for a duration of up to similar to 20 s. After repetitive visual conditioning stimulation ( CS) of zebrafish larvae, we observed rhythmic post-CS activities among specific tectal neuronal ensembles, with a regular interval that closely matched the CS. Visuomotor behaviour of the zebrafish larvae also showed regular post- CS repetitions at the entrained time interval that correlated with rhythmic neuronal ensemble activities in the tectum. Thus, rhythmic activities among specific neuronal ensembles may act as an adjustable 'metronome' for time intervals in the order of seconds, and serve as a mechanism for the short- term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experience.","[Sumbre, German; Poo, Mu-ming] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Muto, Akira; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA","University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Francisco","Poo, MM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","mpoo@berkeley.edu","Sumbre, German/K-7538-2017; Muto, Akira/E-2580-2015","Sumbre, German/0000-0003-4436-6840; Muto, Akira/0000-0003-4276-1775; Baier, Herwig/0000-0002-7268-0469","US National Institutes of Health","US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","We thank A.

In the tectorotundal system, neurons of the stratum griseum centrale (SGC) of the optic tectum send their axons bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt). In transit to the Rt, the axons of the SGC neurons collateralize in the nuclei posteroventralis thalami (PV), subpretectalis (SP), and interstitiopretectosubpretectalis (IPS) of the tectothalamic tract (TT). The current study used birthdating and pathway-tracing methods to investigate the neurogenesis and time course of neuronal connections of the tectorotundal pathway in chicks during embryogenesis. By using tritiated thymidine autoradiography, we observed that the SGC neurons of the tectum were generated by embryonic days 3.0-5.5 (E3.0-E5.5), the Rt by E3.5-E5.0, and the nuclei of TT by E3.5-4.5. To trace the tectorotundal pathway, we injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into the tectum, and the CTb-like immunoreactivity was examined. By E4.5-E5.5, some CTb-like immunoreactive (CTb-LI) axons terminated in the ipsilateral SP/IPS. By E6.0-E6.5, CTb-LI axon bundles were seen ipsilaterally in the TT. Increased numbers of labeled axons were seen terminating in the SP/IPS. By E7.0-E7.5, heavily labeled axons in the TT were observed with diffuse terminals in areas ventral to the presumptive Rt and PV. By E7.5-E8.0, the tectal axons innervated the ipsilateral Rt, in which some of the collaterals crossed the midline to the contralateral diencephalon. The crossed tectorotundal projection was seen first by E8.0-E8.5. Also, during this stage, a few CTb-LI collaterals terminated in the contralateral SP/IPS. Between E10 and. E13, the pattern of bilateral tectorotundal projections became more regionalized, whereas labeling continued to increase in the SP/IPS. At E16, the labeling pattern of all tectorecipient structures resembled that of the hatchling. The current study revealed the temporal order of development of the tectorotundal pathway during embryogenesis. The SGC cells first innervate ipsilaterally the SP/IPS and then the Rt/PV. The schedule of the crossed tectorotundal connections coincides with the schedule of tectal projections onto the contralateral intrinsic nuclei of the TT. We conclude that E8.0 (+/-E0.5) is a critical stage for the development of the tectofugal pathway. Moreover, the current study provides important insights into the relative ontogeny of the mammalian tectofugal pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:115-132, 2000.

Evidence from cytoarchitectonic, stimulation, and functional studies suggests structural and functional divergence between the two subregions. However, a microstructural map of these areas obtained in a representative sample of brains in a stereotaxic reference space is still lacking. In the present study we show that the dorsal mesial frontal motor cortex comprises two microstructurally different brain regions: area SMA and area pre-SMA. Area-specific cytoarchitectonic patterns were studied in serial histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten human postmortem brains. Borders of the two cortical areas were identified using image analysis and statistical features. The 3D reconstructed areas were transferred to a common reference space, and probabilistic maps were calculated by superimposing the individual maps. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging data was subsequently performed using the two probabilistic maps as microstructurally defined seed regions. It revealed that areas SMA and pre-SMA were strongly co-activated with areas in precentral, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri, Rolandic operculum, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. Both areas were related to motor functions, but area pre-SMA was involved in more complex processes such as learning, cognitive processes and perception. The here described subsequent analyses led to converging evidence supporting the microstructural, and functional segregation of areas SMA and pre-SMA, and maps will be made available to the scientific community to further elucidate the microstructural substrates of motor and cognitive control.","[Ruan, Jianghai; Caspers, Svenja; Amunts, Katrin] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, C&O Vogt Inst Brain Res, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Ruan, Jianghai] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Neurol, Luzhou, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Jianghai; Seitz, Ruediger J.] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, LVR Klinikum Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Ctr Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Bludau, Sebastian; Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola; Caspers, Svenja; Mohlberg, Hartmut; Amunts, Katrin] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 1, Julich, Germany; [Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany; [Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola] JARA Translat Brain Med, Aachen, Germany; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Inst Syst Neurosci, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neuroscience & Med INM 7, Julich, Germany; [Seitz, Ruediger J.] Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Dept Neurol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Seitz, Ruediger J.] Florey Neurosci Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Southwest Medical University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health","Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, LVR Klinikum Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Ctr Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Dept Neurol, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Florey Neurosci Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","seitz@neurologie.uni-duesseldorf.de","ruan, jianghai/ABC-8295-2021; Ruan, Jianghai/AAT-4188-2021; Caspers, Svenja/H-9346-2013; Eickhoff, Simon B./K-2061-2013; Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola/N-8886-2014; Amunts, Katrin/I-3470-2013","Ruan, Jianghai/0000-0002-0915-292X; Caspers, Svenja/0000-0001-5083-4669; Eickhoff, Simon B./0000-0001-6363-2759; Amunts, Katrin/0000-0001-5828-0867; Bludau, Sebastian/0000-0001-6173-9050; Mohlberg, Hartmut/0000-0002-7040-3812","China Scholarship Council; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [785907]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","We thank the China Scholarship Council for sponsorship of Jianghai Ruan, and Mr. Ulrich Opfermann-Emmerich for excellent technical assistance.

Both areas received their main thalamic inputs from the ventral anterior and ventral lateral complexes, and received dense projections from the medial premotor cortex. However, there were marked differences in their connections with other cortical areas. While 6DR received consistent inputs from prefrontal cortex, area 6DC received few such connections. Conversely, 6DC, but not 6DR, received major projections from the primary motor and somatosensory areas. Projections from the anterior cingulate cortex preferentially targeted 6DC, while the posterior cingulate and adjacent medial wall areas preferentially targeted 6DR. Projections from the medial parietal area PE to 6DC were particularly dense, while intraparietal areas (especially the putative homolog of LIP) were more strongly labeled after 6DR injections. Finally, 6DC and 6DR were distinct in terms of inputs from the ventral parietal cortex: projections to 6DR originated preferentially from caudal areas (PG and OPt), while 6DC received input primarily from rostral areas (PF and PFG). Differences in connections suggest that area 6DR includes rostral and caudal subdivisions, with the former also involved in oculomotor control. These results suggest that area 6DC is more directly involved in the preparation and execution of motor acts, while area 6DR integrates sensory and internally driven inputs for the planning of goal-directed actions. They also provide strong evidence of a homologous organization of the dorsal premotor cortex in New and Old World monkeys. J. Comp. Neurol. 522:3683-3716, 2014.

This study investigated the novel GLP-1R-Cre mouse as a functional tool to address this question. Methods: Mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the Glp1r promoter were crossed with either a ROSA26 eYFP or tdRFP reporter strain to identify GLP-1R expressing cells. Patch-clamp recordings were performed on tdRFP-positive neurons in acute coronal brain slices from adult mice and selective targeting of GLP-1R cells in vivo was achieved using viral gene delivery. Results: Large numbers of eYFP or tdRFP immunoreactive cells were found in the circumventricular organs, amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei and the ventrolateral medulla. Smaller numbers were observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the thalamic paraventricular nucleus. However, tdRFP positive neurons were also found in areas without preproglucagon-neuronal projections like hippocampus and cortex. GLP-1R cells were not immunoreactive for GFAP or parvalbumin although some were catecholaminergic. GLP-1R expression was confirmed in whole-cell recordings from BNST, hippocampus and PVN, where 100 nM GLP-1 elicited a reversible inward current or depolarisation. Additionally, a unilateral stereotaxic injection of a cre-dependent AAV into the PVN demonstrated that tdRFP-positive cells express cre-recombinase facilitating virally-mediated eYFP expression. Conclusions: This study is a comprehensive description and phenotypic analysis of GLP-1R expression in the mouse CNS. We demonstrate the power of combining the GLP-1R-CRE mouse with a virus to generate a selective molecular handle enabling future in vivo investigation as to their physiological importance.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has antiapoptotic properties in several brain injury models. Here, we tested whether DEX can protect the brain from neurodegeneration in rats exposed to propofol in utero. Materials and Methods: Fetal rats of embryonic day 20 were exposed in utero for 1 hour to propofol anesthesia with DEX or saline, or no anesthesia (control). The fetal brains were harvested 6 hours later. Cleaved caspase-3 levels and the relative number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1)-positive cells were assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Learning and memory functions of the offspring in a separate cohort were assessed at postnatal day 35 by using an 8-arm radial maze. Results: Propofol anesthesia in pregnant rats augmented caspase-3 activation by 217% in the brain tissues of fetal rats and increased the number of IBA1-positive cells in the cortex by 40% and in the thalamus by 270%. Juvenile rats exposed pre-natally to propofol were not different than controls on spontaneous locomotor activity, but made more errors of omission and took longer to complete visiting all 8 arms on days 1, 2, and 3 across a 5-day test in the radial arm maze. This neurocognitive deficit was prevented by administration of DEX (5.0 mu g/kg, IP), which also significantly inhibited propofol-induced caspase-3 activation and microglial response in the fetal brains. Conclusions: DEX attenuates neuronal injury induced by maternal propofol anesthesia in the fetal brains, providing neurocognitive protection in the offspring rats.","[Li, Jing; Xiong, Ming; Nadavaluru, Pratap R.; Zuo, Wanhong; Ye, Jiang Hong; Eloy, Jean D.; Bekker, Alex] Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Dept Anesthesiol, 185 S Orange Ave, Newark, NJ 07103 USA","Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University Medical Center","Bekker, A (corresponding author), Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Dept Anesthesiol, 185 S Orange Ave, Newark, NJ 07103 USA.","bekkeray@njms.rutgers.edu","Eloy, Jean/AAE-8158-2022","Eloy, Jean/0000-0002-3555-9432",,,,,47,54,58,0,9,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0898-4921","1537-1921",,"J NEUROSURG ANESTH","J.

Such studies do not, however, reveal which particular cell types within the S1 cortex receive direct monosynaptic connections from these input sources. Here we describe the monosynaptic inputs to a subpopulation of mouse S1 inhibitory neurons that express ErbB4. We used a previously described bridge protein,'' composed of the ErbB4 ligand, neuregulin (NRG1), fused to the avian viral receptor TVB (TVB-NRG1), along with EnvB pseudotyped lentivirus (LV) and rabies virus (RV), to selectively coinfect ErbB4-expressing neurons (Choi et al. [2010] Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:16703-16708). The RV had its glycoprotein gene deleted and replaced with mCherry, so that infected cells express mCherry and the virus cannot spread without provision of rabies glycoprotein (RG) by transcomplementation. The LV encoded and expressed RG to allow transcomplementation in coinfected neurons, so that the RV could spread transsynaptically and label their direct monosynaptic inputs. The RV could not spread beyond the direct inputs, due to the lack of RG in presynaptic cells. This method revealed long-range connections from thalamus, nucleus basalis, raphe, and distant cortical areas, including ipsilateral motor, secondary somatosensory, retrosplenial, and perirhinal cortex and contralateral S1. In addition, local connections from ipsilateral pyramidal neurons within S1 were labeled. These input sources account for all of the known inputs to S1 described with standard tracers, suggesting that the subpopulation of ErbB4-positive inhibitory neurons infected using the TVB-NRG1 bridge protein receives inputs indiscriminately from S1 input sources.

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sympathetic outflow to the heart is modulated by the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the cortical modulation of cardiovagal activity is still unclear in humans. The present study used functional MRI to investigate the cortical network involved in cardiovagal control. Seventeen healthy individuals performed graded handgrip exercise while heart rate (HR) and cortical activity were recorded. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were measured while participants repeated the same protocol in a parallel experiment session. The handgrip exercise elevated HR and MAP without concurrent elevations in MSNA supporting earlier conclusions that the cardiovascular responses are mainly modulated by vagal withdrawal. The imaging data showed activation in the insular cortex, thalamus, parietal cortices and cerebellum during the exercise period. Consistently across all the participants, the HR response correlated with the deactivation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), which has substantial anatomical connection with the subcortical autonomic structures. The deactivation of the vMPFC was independent of the motor control and was observed commonly in both left and right hand exercise. Stronger vMPFC deactivation was observed when participants completed a higher intensity exercise that elicited a larger HR response. Our findings support the hypothesis that the vMPFC is involved in modulating the vagal efferent outflow to the heart and the suppression of its activity elevates cardiovascular arousal in conscious humans.

For example, our movements while driving a car can be instructed by color cues that we see on traffic lights. These stimuli do not spatially relate to the actions that they specify. Associations between these stimuli and actions are called arbitrary visuomotor conditional associations. Earlier fMRI studies have tried to dissociate the sensory and motor components of these associations by introducing delays between the presentation of arbitrary cues and go-signals that instructed participants to perform actions. This approach, however, also introduces neural processes that are not necessarily related to the normal real-time production of arbitrary visuomotor responses, such as working memory and the suppression of motor responses. We used fMRI adaptation as an alternative approach to dissociate sensory and motor components. We found that visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex adapted only to the presentation of arbitrary visual cues whereas a number of sensorimotor areas adapted only to the production of response. Visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex do not have any known connections with parts of the brain that can control hand musculature. Therefore, it is conceivable that the brain areas that we report as having adapted to both stimulus presentation and response production (namely, the dorsal premotor area, the supplementary motor area, the cingulate, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus area, and the thalamus) are involved in the multiple steps between processing visual stimuli and activating the motor commands that these cues specify.

To establish the use of such tracers in the nonhuman primate, we recently compared the specificity of the anterograde tracer Mn2+ with that of wheat-germ-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) in experiments tracing the neuronal connections of the basal ganglia of the monkey. It was shown that Mn2+ and WGA-HRP yield the same projection patterns and that the former tracer crosses at least two synapses, for it could be found in thalamus following injections into the striatum. Here we provide evidence that Mn2+ reaches the cortex following striaturn injections and, thus, is transferred even further than previously shown. In other words, used as a paramagnetic MRI tracer, Mn2+ can permit the visualization of neural networks covering at least four processing stages. Moreover, unilateral intravitreal injections show that Mn2+ is sufficiently synapse specific to pen-nit visualization of the lamina of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Interestingly, the transfer rate of the substance reflected the well-known axonal size differences between the parvocellular and magnocellular layers of dLGN. After intravitreal injections, we were able to demonstrate transfer of Mn2+ into several subcortical and cortical areas, including the inferotemporal cortex. The specificity of the transsynaptic transfer of manganese that we report here indicates the value of this tracer for chronic studies of development and plasticity, as well as for studies of brain pathology.

Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by reinnervation of denervated targets by regenerating injured axons or by collateral branching Of undamaged axons, and remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of adequate tat-get reinnervation; however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, Such as neuropathic pain and hyperreflexia. After axotomy, neurons shift from a transmitter to a regenerative phenotype, activating molecular pathways that promote neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Peripheral nerve injuries also induce a cascade of events, at the Molecular, cellular, and system levels, initiated by the injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, thalamus, and brain cortex. Mechanisms involved in these changes include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of sensory and motor central maps. An important direction for research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, and are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying positive adaptive changes that improve functional recovery and also reducing undesirable effects.","[Navarro, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Cell Biol Physiol & Immunol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona","Navarro, X (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Navarro, Xavier/C-9577-2011","Navarro, Xavier/0000-0001-9849-902X",,,,,129,70,71,1,20,"ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC","SAN DIEGO","525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","0074-7742",,"978-0-12-375084-6","INT REV NEUROBIOL","Int.

Previous studies have attempted to describe the ontogeny of cerebral glucose metabolism in anesthetized nonhuman primates using [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. However, the use of sedation during the tracer uptake period may influence 1CMR(glc). This study was conducted to describe 1CMR(glc) in conscious infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) during the first year of life utilizing FDG-PET. Cross-sectional studies (n = 23) displayed lowest and highest 1CMR(glc) in all structures at the 2-3 and 8-9 month age groups, respectively. The metabolic pattern suggested an increase in 1CMR(glc) values between 2 and 8 months of age with decreased metabolism observed at 10-12 months of age in all regions. Peak 1CMR(glc) values at 8 months were an average of 84+/-24% higher than values seen at the youngest age examined quantitatively (2-3 months). The regions of greatest and smallest increases in 1CMR(glc) at 8 months were the cerebellar hemispheres (90%) and the thalamus (39%), respectively. Longitudinal analysis in 4 animals supported this developmental pattern, demonstrating the ability to detect changes in cerebral glucose metabolism within animals and the potential for FDG-PET in nonhuman primate models of brain maturation. By determining the normative profile of 1CMR(glc) during development in monkeys, future application of FDG-PET will provide the opportunity to longitudinally assess the effects of environmental or pharmacological intervention on the immature brain.

Complementary DNAs corresponding to the pharmacologically defined mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors have been isolated in various species including man. The expression patterns of opioid receptor transcripts in human brain has not bean established with a cellular resolution, in part because of the low apparent abundance of opioid receptor messenger RNAs in human brain. To visualize opioid receptor messenger RNAs we developed a sensitive in situ hybridization histochemistry method using P-33-labelled RNA probes. In the present study we report the regional and cellular expression of mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor messenger RNAs in selected areas of the human brain. Hybridization of the different opioid receptor probes resulted in distinct labelling patterns. For the mu and kappa opioid receptor probes, the most intense regional signals were observed in striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and certain brainstem areas as well as the spinal cord. The most intense signals for the delta opioid receptor probe were found in cerebral cortex. Expression of opioid receptor transcripts was restricted to subpopulations of neurons within most regions studied demonstrating differences in the cellular expression patterns of mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor messenger RNAs in numerous brain regions. The messenger RNA distribution patterns for each opioid receptor corresponded in general to the distribution of opioid receptor binding sites as visualized by receptor autoradiography. However, some mismatches, for instance between mu opioid receptor receptor binding and mu opioid receptor messenger RNA expression in the anterior striatum, were observed. A comparison of the distribution patterns of opioid receptor messenger RNAs in the human brain and that reported for the rat suggests a homologous expression pattern in many regions. However, in the human brain, kappa opioid receptor messenger RNA expression was more widely distributed than in rodents. The differential and region specific expression of opioid receptors may help to identify targets for receptor specific compounds in neuronal circuits involved in a variety of physiological functions including pain perception, neuroendocrine regulation, motor control and reward.

This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.

He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' Swiss period (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called supplementary motor area was rather a supramotor area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

Here, we review existing anatomical data on the interaction between the BG and the limbic system that support implication of the BG in limbic functions. State of the art. - The BG form a system that is fairly different from the limbic system, but have strong ties, both anatomical and functional, to the latter. Different models have been proposed. In the parallel model, five segregated circuits from the frontal cortex are individualized and terminate in different regions of the BG and thalamus, before projecting back to their cortical area of origin. Based on the extrafrontal cortical projections, another model has been proposed. It subdivides the cortico-striatal projection into three functional territories: limbic, associative and sensorimotor. In a third spiral model, propagation is possible between limbic information processed by the most medial striatal neurons to motor information processed by the most lateral neurons. Perspectives. - Three main levels of interaction between the BG system and the limbic system are considered. (1) The BC receive direct afferences from several structures associated with the limbic system. Limbic cortical areas project to the striatum, of which the internal architecture is particularly complex, with significant cross-species differences: a compartmental striosome/matrix subdivision described mainly in primates, and a core/shell topographic subdivision of the nucleus accumbens more sharply marked in rodents. (2) Projections from the amygdala form a patchy dorso-ventral progressive gradient in the nucleus accumbens and ventral caudate. (3) Both shell and striosomes receive limbic information from cortical and subcortical limbic structures and project to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, which in turn modulates their activity. (4) There is a significant overlap between the ventral portions of the BC, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, and the ventral subcortical structures of the limbic system, extended amygdala and nucleus basalis. Conclusion. - Important interactions exist between the limbic system and the BC system but questions remain about the role that this information plays in the functional organisation of this system. Is limbic information processed separately in the BC, or is it integrated to motor and cognitive information? Do pathological conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorders or Tourette syndrome result from abnormal afferent limbic input to the BG or abnormal processing within the BC?

In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored. Methodology: We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of mu-opioid receptors. Principal Findings: In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with mu-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[C-11] methyl] buprenorphine ([C-11]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition. Conclusions: Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research.","[Seah, Stephanie; Asad, Abu Bakar Ali; Williams, Donald S.; Evelhoch, Jeffrey L.; Chin, Chih-Liang] Merck & Co Inc, Imaging, West Point, PA 19486 USA; [Seah, Stephanie; Asad, Abu Bakar Ali; Reese, Torsten; Henry, Brian; Chin, Chih-Liang] MSD, Translat Med Res Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Baumgartner, Richard; Feng, Dai] Merck & Co Inc, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA; [Manigbas, Elaine; Beaver, John D.] Maccine Pte Ltd, Imaging, Singapore, Singapore","Merck & Company; Merck & Company; Merck & Company","Seah, S (corresponding author), Merck & Co Inc, Imaging, West Point, PA 19486 USA.","stephanie.seah@merck.com","Evelhoch, Jeffrey/R-2619-2019; biomaGUNE, CIC/J-9136-2014","biomaGUNE, CIC/0000-0001-7690-0660","Merck Co.","Merck Co.(Merck & Company)","This research was funded by Merck & Co.

Small bistratified cells ( SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow- OFF [ S- ON/( L + M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high- acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center- surround spatial structure, with the ( L + M)- OFF component of the receptive field similar to 50% larger in diameter than the S- ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the ( L + M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S- ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF- parasol cells. The ( L + M)- OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L- APB. These observations indicate that the ( L + M)- OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF- bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON- parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.","Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Inst Particle Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Field, GD (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","gfield@salk.edu","Field, Greg/AAI-1428-2021","Field, Greg/0000-0001-5942-2679; Chichilnisky, E.J./0000-0002-5613-0248; Gauthier, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0509-8532; Sher, Alexander/0000-0001-6655-6456","NEI NIH HHS [EY017992, R01 EY017992] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,96,125,129,0,15,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Retrograde tracers were used to identify the sources of auditory cortical projections to primary visual cortex (areas 17 and 18) in adult cats. Two groups of animals were studied. In the first group, large deposits were centered on the lower visual field representation of the vertical meridian located along the area 17 and 18 border. Following tissue processing, characteristic patterns of cell body labeling were identified in extrastriate visual cortex and the visual thalamus (LGN, MIN, & LPl). In auditory cortex, of the four tonotopically-organized regions, neuronal labeling was identified in the supragranular layers of the posterior auditory field (PAF). Little to no labeling was evident in the primary auditory cortex, the anterior auditory field, the ventral posterior auditory field or in the remaining six non-tonotopically organized regions of auditory cortex. In the second group, small deposits were made into the central or peripheral visual field representations of primary visual cortex. Labeled cells were identified in PAF following deposits into regions of primary visual cortex representing peripheral, but not central, visual field representations. Furthermore, a coarse topography was identified in PAF, with neurons projecting to the upper field representation being located in the gyral portion of PAF and neurons projecting to the lower field representation located in the sulcal portion of PAF. Therefore, direct projections can be identified from tonotopically organized auditory cortex to the earliest stages of visual cortical processing.","[Lomber, Stephen G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Cerebral Syst Lab, Ctr Brain & Mind,Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; [Hall, Amee J.] Univ Western Ontario, Grad Program Neurosci, London, ON N6A 5B8, Canada; [Lomber, Stephen G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Cerebral Syst Lab, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Lomber, SG (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Cerebral Syst Lab, Ctr Brain & Mind,Schulich Sch Med & Dent, M216 Med Sci Bldg, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada.","steve.lomber@uwo.ca","Lomber, Stephen G/B-6820-2015","Lomber, Stephen G/0000-0002-3001-7909","Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We would like to thank Jeffrey Mellott for assistance with the preparation of the tissue.

Neural activity was assessed in normal volunteers by changes in rCBF measured with PET. Thirteen right-handed subjects participated in three monocular tasks: (i) resting with eyes closed; (ii) sustained foveal fixation upon a LED at 1.2 m (0.83 D); and (iii) accommodating alternately on a near (24 cm, 4.16 D) vs. a far (3.0 m, 0.33 D) LED alternately illuminated in sequential 2 s epochs. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation and of constant foveal fixation revealed activation in cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; middle and inferior temporal cortex (BA 20, 21, 37); striate cortex and associative visual areas (BA 17/18). Comparison of the condition of constant fixation with the condition of resting with closed eyes indicated activation of cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; visual cortices (BA 17/18); a right hemisphere dominant network encompassing prefrontal (BA 6, 9, 47), superior parietal (BA 7), and superior temporal (BA 40) cortices; and bilateral thalamus. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation with closed-eye rest reflected an incremental summation of the activations found in the previous comparisons (i.e. activations associated with constant fixation). Neural circuits activated selectively during the near/far response to blur cues over those during constant visual fixation, occupy posterior structures that include occipital visual regions, cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and temporal cortex.","Karolinska Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Huddinge, Sweden; Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Psychiat Serv, Cognit Neuroimaging Unit, Minneapolis, MN USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychiat, Div Neurosci Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Psychol Serv, Minneapolis, MN USA","Karolinska Institutet; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System","Richter, HO (corresponding author), Univ Gavle, Dept Educ & Psychol, SE-80176 Gavle, Sweden.","hrr@hig.se","Sponheim, Scott/J-3857-2017","Sponheim, Scott/0000-0002-2782-0856",,,,,100,26,26,0,7,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

It is widely believed that this function extends to stopping cognitive processes as well. Consistent with this, mounting evidence establishes the role of the right lateral prefrontal cortex in a clear case of cognitive control: retrieval suppression. Retrieval suppression refers to the ability to intentionally stop the retrieval process that arises when a reminder to a memory appears. Functional imaging data indicate that retrieval suppression involves top-down modulation of hippocampal activity by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but the anatomical pathways supporting this inhibitory modulation remain unclear. Here we bridge this gap by integrating key findings about retrieval suppression observed through functional imaging with a detailed consideration of relevant anatomical pathways observed in non-human primates. Focusing selectively on the potential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, we develop two hypotheses about the pathways mediating interactions between lateral prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobes during suppression, and their cellular targets: the entorhinal gating hypothesis, and thalamo-hippocampal modulation via the nucleus reuniens. We hypothesize that whereas entorhinal gating is well situated to stop retrieval proactively, thalamo-hippocampal modulation may interrupt an ongoing act of retrieval reactively. Isolating the pathways that underlie retrieval suppression holds the potential to advance our understanding of a range of psychiatric disorders characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts. More broadly, an anatomical account of retrieval suppression would provide a key model system for understanding inhibitory control over cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field ( which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.","Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Carandini, M (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 2318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.","matteo@ski.org","Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008; Bonin, Vincent/AAQ-3833-2020; Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021","Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Bonin, Vincent/0000-0002-9437-8092",,,,,101,172,172,1,17,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Microelectrode recordings from these areas have shown that: (1) most of these cortical neurons are connected trisynaptically to the labyrinthine endorgans and (2) they receive converging vestibular, visual and somatosensory inputs. These data suggest that a multimodal cortical system is involved in postural and gaze control. In humans, recent positron emission tomography (PET) scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have largely confirmed these data. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of these two methods, the minimum time of arrival of labyrinthine inputs from the vestibular hair cells to these cortical areas has not yet been determined. In this study, we used the evoked potential method to attempt to answer this question. Due to its excellent temporal resolution, this method is ideal for the investigation of the tri- or polysynaptic nature of the vestibulocortical pathways. Eleven volunteer patients, who underwent a vestibular neurectomy due to intractable Meniere's disease (MD) or acoustic neurinoma resection, were included in this experiment. Patients were anesthetized and the vestibular nerve was electrically stimulated. The evoked potentials were recorded by 30 subcutaneous active electrodes located on the scalp. The brain electrical source imaging (BESA) program (version 2.0, 1995) was used to calculate dipole sources. The latency period for the activation of five distinct cortical zones, including the prefrontal and/or the frontal lobe, the ipsilateral temporoparietal cortex, the anterior portion of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the contralateral parietal cortex, was 6 ms. The short latency period recorded for each of these areas indicates that several trisynaptic pathways, passing through the vestibular nuclei and the thalamic neurons, link the primary vestibular afferents to the cortex. We suggest that all these areas, including the prefrontal area, process egomotion information and may be involved in planning motor synergies to counteract loss of equilibrium.","CNRS Paris 6 Paris 7, ESA 7060, Lab Neurobiol Reseaux Sensorimoteurs, F-75270 Paris 06, France; Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UPR 640, F-75651 Paris 13, France; Hop Lariboisiere, Serv ORL, F-75010 Paris, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Lariboisiere-Fernand-Widal - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Louis - APHP","Vidal, PP (corresponding author), CNRS Paris 6 Paris 7, ESA 7060, Lab Neurobiol Reseaux Sensorimoteurs, 45 Rue St Peres, F-75270 Paris 06, France.","cnp@ccr.jussieu.fr",,,,,,,46,110,111,0,18,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Most kainate-treated rats showed significant volume loss in the amygdala, olfactory cortex, and septal region, but others displayed different patterns, with significant loss only in the hippocampus or thalamus, for example. Average volume loss was most severe in the amygdala and olfactory cortex (82-83% of controls), especially the caudal parts of both regions. In the piriform cortex (including the endopiriform nucleus) of epileptic rats, an average of approximately one-third of Nissl-stained neurons and one-third of the GABAergic interneurons labeled by in situ hybridization for GAD67 mRNA were lost, and the extent of neuron loss was correlated with the extent of volume loss. Volumetric analysis of major forebrain regions was insensitive to specific neuron loss in subregions such as layer III of the entorhinal cortex and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. These findings provide quantitative evidence that kainate-treated rats tend to display extensive neuron and volume loss in the amygdala and olfactory cortex, although the patterns and extent of loss in forebrain regions vary considerably among individuals. In this status epilepticus-based model, extrahippocampal damage appears to be more extensive and hippocampal damage appears to be less extensive than that reported for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

We aimed to define the development of such cortical reorganisation by comparing data from patients with different disease phenotypes. Methods We studied patients with different phenotypes of MS: 16 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 14 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and no disability, 15 patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability, and 12 patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Patients did a simple motor task with their unimpaired dominant hand during MRI, which was compared across the phenotype groups. Findings Patients with a CIS activated more of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex than those with RRMS and no disability, whereas patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the supplementary motor area than those with a CIS. Patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally, and more of the ipsilateral supplementary motor area than patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability. Conversely, patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral. secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, and the ipsilateral precuneus. Patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral thalamus and of the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex than those with SPMS. However, patients with SPMS activated more of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the contralateral precuneus, and the ipsilateral cingulate motor area and inferior parietal lobule. Interpretation Movement-associated cortical reorganisation in patients with MS seems to vary across individuals at different stages of disease. Our study suggests that early in the disease course more areas typically devoted to motor tasks are recruited. Then bilateral activation of these regions is seen, and late in the disease course, areas that healthy people recruit to do novel or complex tasks are activated.","Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Neuroimaging Res Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neuroradiol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Osped Gallarate, Dept Neurol, Gallarate, Italy","Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele","Filippi, M (corresponding author), Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Neuroimaging Res Unit, Via Olgettina 60, I-20132 Milan, Italy.","massimo.filippi@hsr.it","Martinelli, Vittorio/AAN-7240-2020; Filippi, Massimo/K-1755-2018; Rocca, Maria Assunta/K-1619-2018; Calabrese, Massimiliano/I-6195-2012; ghezzi, angelo/AAJ-9606-2020","Filippi, Massimo/0000-0002-5485-0479; Rocca, Maria Assunta/0000-0003-2358-4320; falini, andrea/0000-0002-1461-8755",,,,,63,200,207,0,4,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1474-4422","1474-4465",,"LANCET NEUROL","Lancet Neurol.","OCT",2005,4,10,,,,,618,626,,"10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70171-X","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70171-X"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70171-X"")",,,9,"Clinical Neurology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","969PG",16168930,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000232245900018","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000232245900018"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We completed this trial to determine if smoking cessation decreases the progression of cognitive decline in later life. Methods: We recruited older smokers (n = 229) and never smokers (n = 98) and invited smokers to join a smoking cessation trial. The primary outcome of interest was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores over 24 months. Secondary measures included the Logical Memory test and changes in gray matter density. Successful smoking cessation was defined as a minimum of 547 smoking free days during follow up. Results: The ADAS-cog scores of unsuccessful quitters (UQ) increased (i.e., became worse) 1.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.2 +/- 0.4 points more than the scores of never smokers (NS) (p = 0.001) and successful quitters (SQ) (p = 0.006) respectively over the 24 months of follow up. Similarly, the scores of UQ declined (i.e., became worse) relative to NS on measures of immediate (p = 0.004) and delayed recall (p = 0.029). All analyses were adjusted for age, years of education, baseline cognitive performance, alcohol use, depression scores, and the presence of chronic respiratory disease. Thirty-six NS, 18 SQ and 48 UQ completed the imaging substudy. Compared with NS, UQ showed a disproportional loss of gray matter density in the right thalamus, right and left inferior semi-lunar lobule, as well as left superior and inferior parietal lobule over 24 months. SQ showed loss of gray matter compared with NS in the right middle and inferior occipital gyri, right and left culmen, and the left superior frontal gyrus. We did not find any brain regions in which UQ had lost more gray matter than SQ over 2 years. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking causes cognitive decline and loss of gray matter tissue in the brain over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To examine the SN's involvement in sympathetic outflow, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in intrinsic connectivity of the SN correlate positively with resting postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) burst incidence (BI) in subjects without and with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Overnight polysomnography, 5-min rsMRI, and fibular MSNA recording were performed in 36 subjects (mean age 57 yr; 10 women, 26 men). Independent component analysis (ICA) of the entire cohort identified the SN as including bilateral IC, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). There was a positive correlation between BI and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (P < 0.001), but dual-regression analysis identified no differences in SN functional connectivity between subjects with no or mild OSA (n = 17) and moderate or severe (n = 19) OSA. Correlation analysis relating BI to the strength of connectivity within the SN revealed large (i.e., spatial extent) and strong correlations for the left IC (P < 0.001), right pgACC/MCC (P < 0.006), left TPJ (P < 0.004), thalamus (P < 0.035), and cerebellum (P < 0.013). Indexes of sleep apnea were unrelated to BI and the strength of SN connectivity. There were no relationships between BI and default or sensorimotor network connectivity. This study links connectivity within the SN to MSNA, demonstrating several of its nodes to be key sympathoexcitatory regions.","[Taylor, Keri S.; Millar, Philip J.; Murai, Hisayoshi; Kimmerly, Derek S.; Morris, Beverley L.; Bradley, T.

Recent studies have shown that many neurons in the primate dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) show spatial tuning during inertial motion and that these responses are vestibular in origin. Given their well-studied role in processing visual self-motion cues (i.e., optic flow), these neurons may be involved in the integration of visual and vestibular signals to facilitate robust perception of self-motion. However, the temporal structure of vestibular responses in MSTd has not been characterized in detail. Specifically, it is not known whether MSTd neurons encode velocity, acceleration, or some combination of motion parameters not explicitly encoded by vestibular afferents. In this study, we have applied a frequency-domain analysis to single-unit responses during translation in three dimensions (3D). The analysis quantifies the stimulus-driven temporal modulation of each response as well as the degree to which this modulation reflects the velocity and/or acceleration profile of the stimulus. We show that MSTd neurons signal a combination of velocity and acceleration components with the velocity component being stronger for most neurons. These two components can exist both within and across motion directions, although their spatial tuning did not show a systematic relationship across the population. From these results, vestibular responses in MSTd appear to show characteristic features of spatiotemporal convergence, similar to previous findings in the brain stem and thalamus. The predominance of velocity encoding in this region may reflect the suitability of these signals to be integrated with visual signals regarding self-motion perception.","[DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Fetsch, Christopher R.; Rajguru, Suhrud M.; Karunaratne, Anuk; Gu, Yong; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Karunaratne, Anuk; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","University of Rochester; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)","DeAngelis, GC (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Visual Sci, Meliora 315, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.","gdeangelis@cvs.rochester.edu",,"DeAngelis, Gregory/0000-0002-1635-1273","National Institutes of Health [R01 EY-017866, EY-019087, EY-016178]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","The work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 EY-017866 and EY-019087 to D.

The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning.","[Puigbo, J. -Y.; Maffei, G.; Herreros, I.; Verschure, P.

During one condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with tones separated by a constant interval (auditory synchronisation, AS), followed by tapping without the pacing stimulus (auditory continuation, AC). In another condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with a visual stimulus presented at the same frequency as the tones (visual synchronisation,VS) followed by a tapping sequence without visual pacing (visual continuation, VC). The following main results were obtained: (1) tapping in the context of visual pacing was generally more variable than tapping in the context of auditory stimuli; (2) during all conditions, a fronto-parietal network was active including the dorsal lateral premotor cortex (dPMC), M1, S1, inferior parietal lobule (LPi), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), the right cerebellar hemisphere, and the paravermial region; (3) stronger activation in the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), the left LPi, the SMA, the right inferior cerebellum, and the left thalamus during both auditory conditions (AS and AC) compared to the visual conditions (VS and VC); (4) stronger activation in the right superior cerebellum, the vermis, and the right LPi during the visual conditions (VS and VC); (5) similar activations for the AS and AC conditions; but (6) marked differences between the VS and VC conditions especially in the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and LPi areas; and (7) finally, there were no activations in the auditory and visual cortices when the pacing stimuli were absent. These findings were taken as evidence for a general difference between the motor control modes operative during the auditory and visual conditions. Paced finger tapping in the context of auditory pacing stimuli relies more on brain structures subserving internal motor control while paced finger-tapping in the context of visual pacing stimuli relies on brain structures relying on the subserving processing or imagination of visual pacing stimuli.

Vestibular information is represented in at least three distinct regions of the cerebral cortex in cats and monkeys: the parietal and somatosensory cortex and the parietoinsular vestibular cortex. In addition, vestibular-related signals are found in more extensive regions, including the motor and premotor regions and frontal eye fields. Most of these regions also project directly to the vestibular nuclei. In monkeys, at least six cortical regions have been identified, including the motor, somatosensory, parietal and temporal areas. Most of these regions receive vestibular projections via the thalamus. Most neurons in those cortical areas respond to head velocity and receive converging vestibular, visual and somatosensory input. Electrical stimulation of some of these cortical areas in anesthetized cats influences the activity of many vestibular nuclear neurons including those projecting to the spinal cord. Lesions of the parietal vestibular regions impair the vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR) and visual suppression of the VOR as well as vestibular-related cognitive functions such as spatial perception and memory in human subjects. Diffuse cortical damage also results in similar impairment of the VOR and suppression of the VOR and possibly the vestibulo-collic reflex. Such impairments after cortical lesions may well be due in part to interruption of cortico-vestibular connections. Future studies in alert animals should focus on the role of different cortical regions projecting to the vestibular nuclei, specifically on how each affects the processing of vestibular signals that mediate vestibule-motor reflexes and that are used for vestibular related cognitive processes.",,,"Fukushima, K (corresponding author), HOKKAIDO UNIV, SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,KITA KU,WEST 7, NORTH 15, SAPPORO, HOKKAIDO 060, JAPAN.",,,,,,,,142,117,118,0,7,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

In turn, the posterior parietal areas send projections to the frontal primary motor and premotor areas. This cortical pathway is hypothesized to be involved in the transformation of a visual input into the appropriate motor output. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the entire brain to determine the patterns of activation that occurred while subjects performed a visually guided motor task. In nine human subjects, fMRI data were acquired on a 4-T whole-body MR system equipped with a head gradient coil and a birdcage RF coil using a T-2*-weighted EPI sequence. Functional activation was determined for three different tasks: (1) a visuomotor task consisting of moving a cursor on a screen with a joystick in relation to various targets, (2) a hand movement task consisting of moving the joystick without visual input, and (3) a eye movement task consisting of moving the eyes alone without visual input. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-based activation maps of each subject were generated using period cross-correlation statistics. Subsequently, each subject's brain was normalized to Talairach coordinates, and the individual maps were compared on a pixel by pixel basis. Significantly activated pixels common to at least four out of six subjects were retained to construct the final functional image. The pattern of activation during visually guided movements was consistent with the flow of information from striate and extrastriate visual areas, to the posterior parietal complex, and then to frontal motor areas. The extensive activation of this network and the reproducibility among subjects is consistent with a role for the dorsal stream in transforming visual information into motor behavior. Also extensively activated were the medial and lateral cerebellar structures, implicating the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway in visually guided movements. Thalamic activation, particularly of the pulvinar, suggests that this nucleus is an important subcortical target of the dorsal stream.

Seven days after administration of domoic acid (2.25 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle, brains were collected and sectioned and stained to visualize Nissl substance using thionin, argyrophilia using a cupric silver staining method, astroglia using immunohistochemistry to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein-like immunoreactivity (GFAP-ir), and activated microglia using lectin histochemistry to detect Griffonia simplicifolia I-B-4 isolectin (GSI-B-4) binding in adjacent sections. In approximately 60% of rats to which it was administered, domoic acid caused stereotyped behavior within 60 min, followed by convulsions within 2-3 h. Brains of domoic acid-administered rats that did not manifest stereotyped behavior or convulsions did not differ from brains from vehicle-administered controls. In animals that had manifested stereotyped behavior and convulsions, Nissl staining was mostly unremarkable in brain sections. In contrast, there was intense argyrophilia in anterior olfactory nucleus, CA1 hippocampus, lateral septum, parietal (layer IV), piriform, and entorhinal cortices, ventral posterolateral thalamus, and amygdala. This pattern was reminiscent of that seen in postmortem specimens from humans who consumed domoic acid-tainted mussels and in experimental animals after kainic acid administration. Adjacent sections displayed astrogliosis, evidenced by increased GFAP-ir, which was more diffuse than the argyrophilic reaction. Activated microglia were revealed using GSI-B-4 histochemistry. These data suggest activation of discrete brain circuits in rats that convulse following domoic acid administration and subsequent pathological alterations. The data strongly suggest that neuropathology following domoic acid occurs only in animals manifesting domoic acid-induced sterotypy and convulsions. The data do not rule out more insidious damage in behaviorally normal rats that receive domoic acid.

First published June 29, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00894.2010.-We have recorded single-neuron activity from cytoarchitectonic area 18 of anesthetized (0.4-0.7% isoflurane in 65% N2O-35% O-2 gaseous mixture) domestic cats. Neurons were identified as simple or complex on the basis of the ratios between the phase-variant (F1) component and the mean firing rate (F0) of spike responses to optimized (orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies, size) high-contrast, luminance-modulated, sine-wave drifting gratings (simple: F1/F0 spike-response ratios > 1; complex: F1/F0 spike-response ratios < 1). The predominance (similar to 80%) of simple cells among the neurons recorded from the principal thalamorecipient layers supports the idea that most simple cells in area 18 might constitute a putative early stage in the visual information processing. Apart from the spike-generating regions (the classical receptive fields, CRFs), the receptive fields of three-quarters of area 18 neurons contain silent, extraclassical suppressive regions (ECRFs). The spatial extent of summation areas of excitatory responses was negatively correlated with the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression of spike responses. Lowering the stimulus contrast resulted in an expansion of the summation areas of excitatory responses accompanied by a reduction in the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression. The spatial and temporal frequency and orientation tunings of the ECRFs were much broader than those of the CRFs. Hence, the ECRFs of area 18 neurons appear to be largely inherited from their dorsal thalamic inputs. In most area 18 cells, costimulation of CRFs and ECRFs resulted in significant increases in F1/F0 spike-response ratios, and thus there was a contextually modulated functional continuum between the simple and complex cells.","[Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Discipline Anat & Histol, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Bosch Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Sydney, Univ Sydney Node, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney","Dreher, B (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Discipline Anat & Histol, Sch Med Sci, Anderson Stuart Bldg F13, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","bogdand@anatomy.usyd.edu.au","Solomon, Samuel G/C-8779-2009","Zeater, Natalie/0000-0001-8555-6574; Solomon, Samuel/0000-0001-5321-0288","National Health and Medical Research Council; Australian Research Council","National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This work was supported by the grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Research Council.",,139,5,5,0,6,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Firstly it has a strictly defined genetically determined substrate of specific neurons classes, specific rules for which kinds of cells interconnect, a laminar architecture where efferent and afferent relays and interlaminar links are predetermined. But, as well, a second strategy allows great developmental lability in the precise spatial patterns of intralaminar circuits of the excitatory neurons and in the actual weights of excitatory and inhibitory synapses that are contributed to each neuron. This second strategy presumably allows the cortex to be tailor-made to the early experience of each individual and, as well, allow for lability of responses to different conditions of stimulation and adjustment of the system to compensate to some degree for injuries affecting afferents and circuitry in the adult system.","Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA","Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah","Lund, JS (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, 50 N Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.",,,,,,,,48,12,13,0,1,"KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-4864",,,"J NEUROCYTOL","J.

A small target spot appeared in a corner of each polygon, There were two tasks: the visuomotor task and the matching-to-sample task, In the visuomotor task, the subject moved a joystick in a direction indicated by either the location of the target spot inside the object (if object-centred coordinates were operative) or the location of the object relative to the video screen (if screen-centred coordinates were operative;), In the matching-to-sample task, the subject moved the joystick to report whether the relevant spatial information (object- or screen-centred) in the cue matched the sample. In both the visuomotor and the matching-to-sample task, use of object-centred (versus screen- or viewer-centred) information caused augmented activation in the inferior occipitotemporal cortex, bilaterally, in the left superior occipital gyrus, and in both the thalamus and the brainstem, In addition, in the visuomotor task such activation occurred in the right posterior parietal cortex and in the left ventral premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior supplementary motor areas. These findings suggest the involvement of the occipitotemporal cortex and a broad frontoparietal network when, as in the visuomotor task, object-centred information guides movement, When the same data underlie declarative reports, as in the matching-to-sample task, thp occipitotemporal cortex remains engaged but frontoparietal network diminishes in importance.","NINDS, Human Motor Control Sect, Med Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, NIH, Poolesville, MD USA","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)","Hallett, M (corresponding author), NINDS, Human Motor Control Sect, Med Neurol Branch, NIH, Bldg 10,Room 5N226,10 Ctr Dr,MSC-1428, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","hallett@codon.nih.gov","Deiber, Marie-Pierre/ABF-9026-2020; Deiber, Marie-Pierre/M-5949-2014","Deiber, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-4984-7363",,,,,69,41,41,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","NOV",1998,121,,11,,,,2145,2158,,"10.1093/brain/121.11.2145","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.11.2145"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.11.2145"")",,,14,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","145KY",9827774,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000077371100012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000077371100012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

We immunohistochemically investigated Fos protein expression in the brain of rats exposed to gravito-inertial force changes. Experiments were performed in hypergravity rats born and housed for 60 days in terrestrian gravity (1 x g) and thereafter exposed for 90 min to 2 x g or 4 x g in a centrifuge, and in hypogravity rats born and housed for 60 days at 2 x g and submitted for 90 min to 1 x g. Data from these two experimental groups were quantified by light microscopy and compared to those from two groups of control rats born and permanently housed in either 1 x g or 2 x g environments that never had to adapt to novel gravito-inertial environments. Results showed a low basal Fos expression in the controls and a strong Fos staining in the experimental rats. Only the hypergravity rats displayed Fos-positive cells in vestibular-related brainstem regions (medial, inferior, and superior vestibular nuclei (VN); group y; dorsomedial cell column (DMCC) of the inferior olive (IO)). By contrast, many suprabulbar areas were strongly labeled in both the hyper- and hypogravity rats, as shown by the numerous Fos-positive cells in mesencephalic (colliculus, laterodorsal periaqueductal gray, autonomic nuclei), diencephalic (hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei), and telencephalic (parietal, temporal, entorhinal and visual cortices) structures. These spatial patterns of Fos expression suggest that an increase in gravito-inertial force activates otolith-vestibulo-olivar pathways and various suprabulbar structures underlying the corticovestibular interactions, which govern the multiple representations of vestibular information in the cortex. A decrease in gravito-inertial force has the opposite effects on the vestibulo-olivar structures as a result of otolith system disfacilitation which, in turn, modifies the activity of complex neural pathways. Exposure to both hyper- and hypogravity environments likely induces neurovegetative and/or stress effects that could account for Fos labeling in autonomic nuclei and in nervous structures involved in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.

In addition, we used the 2-deoxyglucose method for a functional assay of both columnar systems. To this end, cats were injected with [H-3]proline in the right eye. Two weeks later, they were stimulated monocularly through this eye by presenting contours of only a single orientation in the left and contours of many different orientations in the right visual hemifield while 2-deoxyglucose was injected. The patterns of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake and of terminal labelling were analysed in flat-mount sections of the visual cortices and in frontal sections of the lateral geniculate nuclei. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, regions of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake are in register with the [H-3]proline-labelled laminae of the open eye. In the visual cortex, the hemispheres stimulated with many different orientations showed a rather homogeneous accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose over the entire extent and throughout all layers of area 17. The hemispheres stimulated with a single orientation displayed columnar patterns of orientation domains essentially similar to those obtained with binocular presentation of a single orientation. In particular and despite monocular stimulation, regions of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake were neither in register with the [H-3]proline-labelled terminals of the stimulated eye in layer IV nor confined to columns of neural tissue above and below these terminals. The maximal horizontal offset between the termination sites of thalamic afferents and activated orientation columns was in the order of 400 mum. These findings suggest several conclusions. (i) In the cat visual cortex, binocular convergence seems to occur so early in cortical processing that monocular stimulation with many orientations leads to a rather homogeneous activation of cortical tissue. (ii) From the termination zones of geniculate afferents activity is apparently distributed already within layer IV to the respective orientation columns. (iii) This horizontal spread of activity could be assured by target cells with radially extending dendrites and/or tangentially oriented fibres.",,,"LOWEL, S (corresponding author), MAX PLANCK INST HIRNFORSCH,DEUTSCHORDENSTR 46,W-6000 FRANKFURT 71,GERMANY.",,"Singer, Wolf/D-6874-2012",,,,,,47,11,11,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM","OXFORD","WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Immunohistochemistry was used to assess cytoarchitecture with neuron-specific nuclear binding protein (NeuN) and neurocytology with intermediate neurofilament proteins, parvalbumin and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Key findings include: (1) Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) area 32 has dorsal and ventral divisions. (2) Area 33 is part of ACC. (3) Midcingulate cortex (MCC) has anterior and posterior divisions and this was verified with extensive quantitative analysis and a horizontal series of sections. (4) NeuN, also known as Fox-3, is not limited to somata and formed nodules, granular clusters and striations in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. (5) Area 30 forms a complex of anterior and posterior parts with further medial and lateral divisions. (6) Area 29b has two divisions and occupies substantially more volume than in rat. (7) Area 29a begins with a subsplenial component and extends relatively further caudal than in rat. As similar areal designations are often used among species, direct comparisons were made of rabbit areas with those in rat and monkey. The dichotomy of MCC is of particular interest to studies of pain as anterior MCC is most frequently activated in human acute pain studies and the rabbit can be used to study this subregion. Finally, the area 30 complex is not primarily dysgranular as in rat and is more differentiated than in any other mammal including human. The large and highly differentiated rabbit cingulate cortex provides a unique model for assessing cingulate cortex, pain processing and RNA splicing functions.","[Vogt, Brent A.] Cingulum Neurosci Inst, Manlius, NY 13104 USA; [Vogt, Brent A.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA","Boston University","Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Cingulum Neurosci Inst, Manlius, NY 13104 USA.;Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA.","bvogt@twcny.rr.com","Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015","Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410","Cingulum Neurosciences Institute","Cingulum Neurosciences Institute","I thank Dr. Robert W.

Here we examined histological sections stained for myelin, Nissl substance, and cytochrome oxidase, allowing identification of likely homologues of most of the architectural fields defined in Old World monkeys. Ventrally, we identified three granular fields at or near the frontal pole (area 10, and the medial and lateral subregions of area 11), and two granular fields along the lateral margin of the orbitofrontal cortex (medial and orbital subdivisions of area 12). More caudal and medially, dysgranular and agranular cortices included four subdivisions of area 13 as well as rostral and caudal subdivisions of area 14 (at the ventrome-dial convexity). The ventral frontotemporal transition encompassed at least two subdivisions of agranular insular cortex, as well as the likely homologues of the gustatory cortices. Most of the medial surface was encompassed by area 10 (which projected a caudomedial finger-like extension toward the subgenual cortex), together with a relatively large dysgranular area 32 and an agranular area 25 (in subgenual cortex). Finally, the caudal limit of the medial frontal cortex included two fields of agranular cingulate cortex (areas 24a and 24b). These findings enhance our understanding of the architectural organization of the marmoset frontal cortex and highlight a highly conserved basic organization across simian primates, allowing the informed interpretation of experimental neurological studies.

Electrical stimulation (500 ms trains) delivered to microelectrode sites evoked movements of reach, defense, and grasp, from distinct zones in M1/PM and PPC, in squirrel and owl monkeys. Tracer injections into M1/PM reach, defense, and grasp zones showed dense connections with M1/PM hand/forelimb representations. The densest inputs outside of frontal cortex were from PPC zones. M1 zones were additionally connected with somatosensory hand/forelimb representations in areas 3a, 3b, and 1 and the somatosensory areas of the upper bank of the lateral sulcus (S2/PV). Injections into PPC zones showed primarily local connections and the densest inputs outside of PPC originated from M1/PM zones. The PPC reach zone also received dense inputs from cortex caudal to PPC, which likely relayed visual information. In contrast, the PPC grasp zone was densely connected with the hand/forelimb representations of areas 3a, 3b, 1, and S2/PV. Thus, the dorsal parietal-frontal network involved in reaching was preferentially connected to visual cortex, whereas the more ventral network involved in grasping received somatosensory inputs.

Recent physiological data revealed that the disparity selective V2 cells increase their responses when (random-dot stereograms) stimuli within their receptive fields are at or near the boundary of a depth surface. Such highlights to depth (non-luminance) edges are seemingly not computationally required for the correspondence problem. Computationally, these highlights make the boundaries of a depth surface more salient, serving pre-attentive segmentation (between depth planes) and attracting visual attention. In special cases, they enable the psychophysically observed perceptual pop-out of a target from a background of visually identical distractors at a different depth. To achieve the highlights, mutual inhibition between disparity selective cells that are tuned to the same or similar depths is required. However, such mutual inhibition would impede the computation for the correspondence problem, which requires mutual excitation between the same cells. In this work, I introduce a computational model that, I believe, is the first to address both stereo correspondence and pre-attentive stereo segmentation. The computational mechanisms in the model are based on intracortical interactions in V2. I will demonstrate that the model captures the following physiological and psychophysical phenomena: (i) depth-edge highlighting; (ii) disparity capture; (iii) pop-out; and (iv) transparency.","UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England","University of London; University College London","Zhaoping, L (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Psychol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,"Zhaoping, Li/HLQ-0173-2023",,,,,,29,12,12,0,2,"ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8436",,,"PHILOS T R SOC B","Philos.

The thinner apical dendrites of the smaller pyramidal cells in layer VIa also form groups that are referred to as bundles. These bundles ascend, into layer IV independent of the clusters, and their arrangement suggests that the bundles are formed so that the apical dendrites of the layer VIa pyramids can pass between the groups of cell bodies of the layer V neurons. It is proposed that the clusters formed from the apical dendrites of the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells represent the axes of vertical modules of pyramidal cells, which represent the basic neuronal aggregates within area 17 of cat visual cortex. And it is suggested that these modules can be recruited in various combinations, most obviously by the excitation provided by the thalamic inputs, to form the functional columns, such as the ones that are concerned with eye preference and orientation. Based upon the distribution of the dendritic clusters, the pyramidal cell modules would have diameters of 56 mum, and since they are considered to extend through the depth of the cortex, each one would contain some 203 neurons. The striate cortex of one hemisphere contains 160,000 of these modules, which is about the same as the number of X-cells projecting to one hemisphere from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and twice the number of X- or beta-ganglion cells in the retina. The form of the pyramidal cell modules in cat striate cortex is compared to those present in monkey striate cortex, in which the similar modules are about 10 times more numerous, but only 31 mum in diameter (Peters and Sethares, 1991a).","HACETTEPE UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT, 06100 SIHHIYE, TURKEY","Hacettepe University","PETERS, A (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, 80 E CONCORD ST, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA.",,,"Peters, Alan/0000-0003-2815-9067","NINDS NIH HHS [NS 07016] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,84,106,107,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Other goals of this investigation are to identify other pretectal nuclear projections from the visual cortex in the guinea pig, and to determine whether there is any visuotopic organization in this pathway. Axonal tracers (biocytin or H-3-leucine) were injected into the striate cortex (Oc 1), and the tissue processed with histochemical or light autoradiographic techniques. All subcortical terminal labeling is ipsilateral in the basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, projections are traced to the ipsilateral brainstem, including two areas of the pretectal complex: (1) one in the NOT, extending in some cases to the adjacent lateral portion of the posterior pretectal nucleus (PPN), and (2) one in the pars compacta of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APNc). The terminal fields in the APN are consistently located rostrally in the dorsolateral portion of the nucleus, independently of the injection site in Oc 1, whereas in the NOT the terminal fields shift slightly after injections placed in different locations in the striate cortex. A correlation of the injection sites in Oc 1 and terminal fields in the NOT reveals a loose topographic organization in the cortico-NOT projection; accordingly, the rostrocaudal axis of the striate cortex projects to the lateromedial axis of the NOT, with a 90 degrees rotation, whereas lateral parts of the striate cortex project diffusely throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the NOT. These data show for the first time that the NOT in the guinea pig receives a substantial projection from the visual cortex. Given the fact that in the guinea pig the optokinetic nystagmus shares some of the characteristics found in cat and monkey (i.e., consistent initial fast rise in the slow phase velocity and reduced asymmetry in monocular stimulation), the present findings lend support to the hypothesis that a cortical input to the NOT is a necessary condition for these oculomotor properties to be present.

The force co-ordination pattern was investigated by means of a specially designed object that monitored the isometric fingertip forces applied to the contact surfaces during precision grip, Hand function was measured by means of neurological examination, functional hand-grips and dexterity, Brain lesions were identified by series of ultrasound and MRI scans. Normally, the fingertip forces are applied to the object in the initial phase of the lift in an invariant force co-ordination pattern (i.e. grip-lift synergy), in which the grip and load forces are initiated simultaneously and increase in parallel with unimodal force rate trajectories. A majority of children with unilateral brain lesions had not developed the force co-ordination pattern typical for their age, but produced an immature or a pathological pattern. The developmental level of the grip-lift synergy was determined and quantified according to criteria derived from earlier studies on normally developed children, There was a clear relationship between the developmental level of the grip-lift synergy and impaired dexterity, indicating that proper development of the force co-ordination pattern is important for skilled hand function, The grip-lift synergy correlated with the total extent of lesions in the contralateral cortex and white matter and with lesions in the thalamus/basal ganglia, while no correlation was found for isolated cortical lesions. The results suggest that the neural circuits involved in the control of the precision grip are organized in a parallel and distributed system in the hemispheres, and that the basal ganglia are important during the formation of these circuits. Perinatal lesions in specific cortical motor areas may be compensated for by circuits elsewhere in the grip-lift motor system, while large lesions exclude this possibility.","Karolinska Inst, Dept Woman & Child Hlth, Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, Lab Neurobiol Integrat & Adaptat, Marseille, France; Hammersmith Hosp, Dept Paediat, London, England","Karolinska Institutet; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Imperial College London","Forssberg, H (corresponding author), Karolinska Hosp, Astrid Lindgren Hosp, Motorik Lab, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.","hansf@child.ks.se","Forssberg, Hans/A-2944-2009","Forssberg, Hans/0000-0003-2069-6618",,,,,74,79,79,0,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","JUN",1999,122,,6,,,,1157,1168,,"10.1093/brain/122.6.1157","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/122.6.1157"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/122.6.1157"")",,,12,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","214GQ",10356067,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000081320600014","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000081320600014"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

However, direct investigation of the influence of brain circuitry on function has been hindered by the lack of a technique for exploring anatomical connectivity in the in vivo brain. Recent advances in magnetic resonance diffusion imaging have given scientists access to data relating to local white matter architecture and, for the first time, have raised the possibility of in vivo investigations into brain circuitry. This review investigates whether diffusion imaging may be used to identify regions of grey matter that are distinct in their connectional architecture, and whether these connectional differences are reflected either in local cytoarchitecture or in local grey matter function. Establishing a direct relationship between regional boundaries based on diffusion imaging and borders between regions that perform different functions would not only be of great significance when interpreting functional results, but would also provide a first step towards the validation of diffusion-based anatomical connectivity studies.","Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Ctr Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain, Oxford OX3 9DU, England","University of Oxford","Behrens, TEJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Ctr Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.","behrens@fmrib.ox.ac.uk","Jovicich, Jorge/D-2293-2010","Behrens, Timothy/0000-0003-0048-1177; Johansen-Berg, Heidi/0000-0002-4134-9730",,,,,44,88,88,0,12,"ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8436","1471-2970",,"PHILOS T R SOC B","Philos.

TS activated two sources sequentially within SI: one in the posterior bank of the central sulcus and another in the crown of the postcentral gyrus, corresponding to Brodmann's areas 3b and 1, respectively. Activities from area 3b consisted of 20- and 30-ms responses. Activities from area 1 consisted of three components peaking at 26, 36 and 49 ms. ES activated one source within SI whose location and orientation were similar to those of the TS-activated area 1 source. Activities from this source consisted of three components peaking at 88, 98 and 109 ms, later by 60 ms than the corresponding TS responses. ES and TS subsequently activated a similar region in the upper bank of the sylvian fissure, corresponding to the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The onset latency of the SII activity following ES (109 ms) was later by 29 ms than that of the first SI response (80 ms). Likewise, the onset latency of SII activity following TS (52 ms) was later by 35 ms than that of area 1 of SI (17 ms). Therefore, our results showed that the processing of noxious and innocuous stimuli is similar with respect to the source locations and activation timings within SI and SII except that there were no detectable activations within area 3b following noxious stimulation.","Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Integrat Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)","Inui, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Integrat Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","inui@nips.ac.jp","Tran, Tuan/HMD-9799-2023; Ojima, Shiro/GPK-7761-2022","Ojima, Shiro/0000-0002-2740-692X; Tran, Diep Tuan/0000-0002-3355-7951",,,,,42,64,66,0,5,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception, often by making the sound seem louder, the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review, we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g., what circuits underlie multisensory convergence), and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g., what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact, it seems that the question is no longer whether low level, putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences, but how.

The AI core could be distinguished from the DC belt on the basis of its strict tonotopic organization, evident in all chinchillas studied (including the youngest). Averaged by age group and compared to their core counterparts, belt neurons generally had similar absolute (spike rate) thresholds and onset latencies (at a given sound pressure level), but lower maximum spike rates, broader tuning bandwidths, and more complex (multipeaked) receptive fields. Most notably, the fraction of complex belt units in the near-newborn (P3) group was high (similar to 50%), and did not systematically increase with age, while that of complex core units was similar to 10% at P3 and increased steadily to about 40% in adulthood.

Studies of visual onset latencies generally suggest that parallel processing occurs throughout the dorsal stream. These studies are at odds with the proposed hierarchies of visual areas based on termination patterns of cortico-cortical projections. In previous studies, a variety of stimuli have been used to compute latencies, and this is problematic as latencies are known to depend on stimulus parameters. This could explain the discrepancy between latency and neuroanatomical based studies. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to determine whether latencies increased along the hierarchy of visual areas when the same stimuli are used. In addition, the effect of stimulus complexity was assessed. Visual onset latencies were calculated for area 17, PMLS, AMLS, and AEV neurons. Latencies were also computed from neurons in the lateral posterior (LP)-pulvinar complex given the importance of this extrageniculate complex in cortical intercommunication. Latency distributions from all regions overlapped substantially, and no significant difference was present, regardless of the type of stimulus used. The onset latencies in the LP-pulvinar complex were comparable to those seen in cortical areas. The data suggest that the initial processing of information in the visual system is parallel, despite the presence of a neuroanatomical hierarchy. Simultaneous response onsets among cortical areas and the LP-pulvinar suggest that the latter is more than a simple relay station for information headed to cortex. The data are consistent with proposals of the LP-pulvinar as a center for the integration and distribution of information from/to multiple cortical areas.","Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada","Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal","Casanova, C (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, Succursale Ctr Ville,CP 6128, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.","christian.casanova@umontreal.ca",,,,,,,64,24,24,0,6,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Geniculocortical K axons were labeled via iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into the LGN and intracortical layer IV axons (indirect P and M pathways to the CO-blobs) were labeled by iontophoretic injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into layer IV. The neurochemical content of both pre-and postsynaptic profiles was identified by postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Sizes of pre- and postsynaptic elements were quantified by using an image analysis system, BioQuant IV. Our chief finding is that K LGN axons and layer IV axons (indirect input from M and P pathways) exhibit different synaptic relationships to CO blob cells. Specifically, our results show that within the CO blobs: 1) all K cell axons contain glutamate, and the vast majority of layer IV axons contain glutamate with only 5% containing GABA; 2) K axons terminate mainly on dendritic spines of glutamatergic cells, while layer IV axons terminate mainly on dendritic shafts of glutamatergic cells; 3) K axons have larger boutons and contact larger postsynaptic dendrites, which suggests that they synapse closer to the cell body within the CO blobs than do layer IV axons. Taken together, these results suggest that each input pathway to the CO blobs uses a different strategy to contribute to the processing of visual information within these compartments.

Since the contribution of the AGG to pain processing is poorly understood, this study employed PET and magnetic resonance (MR) image co-registration in grouped and individual cases to locate regions of altered relative regional cerebral blood flow (rGBF). Seven right-handed, neurologically intact males were subjects; each received neuropsychological and pain threshold testing. Subjects were scanned during infusion of H-2[O-15]: four randomized scans during innocuous heat stimulation to the back of the left hand and four scans during noxious but bearable heat to the same place. The averaged rGBF values during innocuous stimuli were subtracted from those during noxious stimuli and statistical parametric maps (SPMs) for the group were computed to identify regions of altered relative rGBF. Finally, single-subject PET images of elevated and reduced rCBF were co-registered with MR images and projected onto reconstructions of the medial surface of the hemisphere. The SPM analysis of the group showed one site with elevated rCBF in the midcingulate cortex and one in the perigenual cortex predominantly contralateral to the side of stimulation. There were bilateral sites of reduced rGBF in the cingulofrontal transitional cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCG). Co-registered PET and MR images for individuals showed that only one case had a single, large region of elevated rCBF, while the others had a number of smaller regions. Six cases had at least one significant elevation of rGBF in the right hemisphere that primarily involved area 24b'; five of these cases also had an elevation in area 32', while the seventh case had elevated rGBF in these areas in the left hemisphere. The rostral site of elevated rCBF in the group was at the border of areas 24/24' and areas 32/32', although most cases had a site of elevation more rostral in the perigenual cingulate cortex. The AGG site of reduced rGBF was in areas 8 and 32 and that in the PCG included much of areas 29/30 in the callosal sulcus, areas 23b and 31 on the cingulate gyral surface and parietal area 7m. The localization of relative rGBF changes suggests different roles for the cingulate cortex in pain processing: (i) elevated rGBF in area 24' may be involved in response selection like nocifensive reflex inhibition; (ii) activation of the perigenual cortex may participate in affective responses to noxious stimuli like suffering associated with pain; and (iii) reduced rCBF in areas 8 and 32 may enhance pain perception in the perigenual cortex, while that in the PGC may disengage visually guided processes.","HOPE HOSP, RHEUMAT DIS CTR, SALFORD M6 8HD, LANCS, ENGLAND; UNIV MANCHESTER, SALFORD M6 8HD, LANCS, ENGLAND","N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester","Vogt, BA (corresponding author), WAKE FOREST UNIV, BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED, DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL, MED CTR BLVD, WINSTON SALEM, NC 27157 USA.",,"Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015","Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410; Jones, Anthony/0000-0001-6944-9365; Derbyshire, Stuart/0000-0002-2766-3424",,,,,81,309,322,0,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568",,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

This study employed multiple-electrode arrays with relatively high spatial resolution (0.1 or 0.2 mm spacing) to record laminar profiles of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), multiple unit activity (MUA) and current source-densities (CSDs) at several sites across the postcentral gyri of two awake monkeys. This high resolution laminar analysis strongly supports our earlier hypothesis based upon low resolution data that N1 is generated by synaptic excitation targeted specifically at the most superficial cortical layers I/II: (1) The excitatory nature of N1 was indicated by elevated MUA which was maximal in layer III and extended down to subcortical white matter where fiber activity exceeded prestimulus levels; (2) In addition to CSD analysis, the observation that N1 was maximally negative within 0.10 mm of the border between layers I and II verified the superficial site of N1 synaptic excitation regardless of conductivity boundaries near the pial surface. A review of the anatomical literature finds that the most likely inputs responsible for N1 activation are the backward cortico-cortical projections from secondary somatosensory areas to SI which in area 1 are the major source of sensory-related input that specifically terminates in layers I/II. We suggest, therefore, that backward projections are involved in the conscious process of touch sensation as it is signaled by N1.","NORTHEASTERN OHIO UNIV, COLL MED, DEPT NEUROBIOL, ROOTSTOWN, OH 44272 USA","Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED)",,,,,,,,,57,110,112,0,3,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Music acts as a specific stimulus to obtain motor and emotional responses by combining movement and stimulation of different sensory pathways. We explored the efficacy of active music therapy (MT) on motor and emotional functions in patients with PD. Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study lasted 3 months. It consisted of weekly sessions of MT and physical therapy (PT). Thirty-two patients with PD, all stable responders to levodopa and in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or 3, were randomly assigned to two groups of 16 patients each. We assessed severity of PD with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, emotional functions with the Happiness Measure, and quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire. MT sessions consisted of choral singing, voice exercise, rhythmic and free body movements, and active music involving collective invention. PT sessions included a series of passive stretching exercises, specific motor tasks, and strategies to improve balance and gait. Results: MT had a significant overall effect on bradykinesia as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (p < .034). Post-MT session findings were consistent with motor improvement, especially in bradykinesia items (p < .0001). Overtime, changes on the Happiness Measure confirmed a beneficial effect of MT on emotional functions (p < .0001). Improvements in activities of daily living and in quality of life were also documented in the MT group (p < .0001). PT improved rigidity (p <.0001). Conclusions: MT is effective on motor, affective, and behavioral functions. We propose active MT as a new method for inclusion in PD rehabilitation programs.","Univ Pavia, IRCCS C Mondino, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Ctr, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","IRCCS Fondazione Casimiro Mondino; University of Pavia","Pacchetti, C (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, IRCCS C Mondino, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Ctr, Via Palestro 3, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.","pacchett@mondino.it","Nappi, Giuseppe/AAF-4962-2021; fundarò, cira/E-8284-2019; Mancini, Francesca/K-2700-2013; pacchetti, claudio/AAA-5033-2020","Nappi, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4274-5281; fundarò, cira/0000-0002-7810-8885; Mancini, Francesca/0000-0003-4246-173X; ",,,,,63,247,251,7,178,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA","0033-3174",,,"PSYCHOSOM MED","Psychosom.

The task was a complicated right-hand finger movement sequence. The subjects were examined at three stages: during initial practice of the finger movement sequence, in an advanced stage of learning, and after they had learnt the finger movement sequence. Quantitative evaluation of video tapes and electromyographic records of the right forearm and hand muscles demonstrated that the finger movements significantly accelerated and became more regular. Significant mean RCBF increases were induced in the left motor hand area, the left premotor cortex, the left supplementary motor area, the left sensory hand area, the left supplementary sensory area and the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum. During the learning process significant depressions of the mean RCBF occurred bilaterally in the superior parietal lobule, the anterior parietal cortex and the pars triangularis of the right inferior frontal cortex. The mean RCBF increases in these structures during the initial stage of learning were related to somatosensory feedback processing and internal language for the guidance of the finger movements. These activations disappeared when the subjects had learnt the finger movement sequence. Conversely, the mean RCBF significantly rose during the course of learning in the midsector of the putamen and globus pallidus on the left side. It is suggested that during the learning phase of this movement sequence, the basal ganglia were critically involved in the establishment of the final motor programme.","KAROLINSKA INST,POSITRON EMISS TOMOG LAB,S-10401 STOCKHOLM 60,SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP,S-10401 STOCKHOLM 60,SWEDEN","Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital","SEITZ, RJ (corresponding author), HEINRICH HEINE UNIV,DEPT NEUROL,MOORENSTR 5,W-4000 DUSSELDORF 1,GERMANY.",,,,,,,,111,261,265,0,23,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM","OXFORD","WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

It receives extensive sensory input and sends output to areas important for emotional processing and expression, including medial temporal cortical areas, hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic areas, and the amygdala. In the rat, the functional relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala has been investigated in numerous recent studies. Clearer understanding of the complex connections between the rat orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala is fundamental to elucidating the functional contributions of these pathways. Recent work shows that, as in the primate, the subdivisions of the rat orbitofrontal cortex issue different patterns of projections to the amygdala, with intriguing variations in the relative distribution of projections to the sensory-related basal areas compared with output areas, such as the central nucleus. Notably, as has been observed in the monkey, the rat orbitofrontal cortex targets the intercalated nuclei, which contain GABAergic interneurons and provide local inhibitory influences within the amygdala. The complex connections between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, as well as other areas involved in emotion, suggest important implications for the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in anxiety disorders, in which emotional expression is not appropriate to the situation.","Grinnell Coll, Dept Psychol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA",,"Rempel-Clower, NL (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Dept Psychol, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.","rempelcl@grinnell.edu",,,,,,,71,114,118,2,18,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0077-8923",,"978-1-57331-683-5","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2007,1121,,,,,,72,86,,"10.1196/annals.1401.026","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.026"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.026"")",,,15,"Behavioral Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Behavioral Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry","BHD18",17846152,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000252265300006","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000252265300006"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The purpose of this study is to further examine the influence of tactile cues on real and apparent sensations of self-rotation and corresponding vestibular nystagmus during passive yaw rotation. Method: There were 15 healthy subjects (12 men and 3 women, 31 to 49 yr) who were subjected to clockwise yaw rotation at a constant velocity of 120 degrees center dot s(-1). A tactile vest using electromechanical tactors (8 columns x 3 rows) was activated either in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction in a randomized design. The sequential activation of the tactors around the body matched the velocity of chair rotation. Eye movements were monitored using infrared eye tracking. Since it is difficult to control for mental set (alertness and imagined target distance) during eye tracking, in addition to paying attention to the apparent sensation of self-motion, the sensation of rotation and the induced vestibular nystagmus were investigated separately. Results. ANOVA failed to reveal any significant effect. Our results suggested that tactile cueing did not enhance or suppress the subjective sensation of rotation during actual rotation, nor did it enhance or suppress the false sensation of rotation experienced. Also, tactile cueing had no effect on the gain and time constant of the induced per-rotation and post-rotation nystagmus with repeated exposures. Conclusion: It appears that tactile cueing delivered by a tactile garment provides a sense of direction, but it does not affect any concomitant vestibular responses.","Dept Natl Defence, Def Res & Dev Canada Toronto, Toronto, ON M3M 3B9, Canada",,"Cheung, B (corresponding author), Dept Natl Defence, Def Res & Dev Canada Toronto, 1133 Sheppard Ave W, Toronto, ON M3M 3B9, Canada.","bob.cheung@drdc-rddc.gc.ca",,,,,,,24,3,3,0,3,"AEROSPACE MEDICAL ASSOC","ALEXANDRIA","320 S HENRY ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-3579 USA","0095-6562",,,"AVIAT SPACE ENVIR MD","Aviat.

Here we used tractography derived from diffusion imaging data to characterize the connections between the pons and the individual lobules of the cerebellum and generate a parcellation of the pons and middle cerebellar peduncle based on the pattern of connectivity. We identified a rostral to caudal gradient in the pons, similar to that observed in the animal work, such that rostral regions were preferentially connected to cerebellar lobules involved in non-motor, and caudal regions with motor regions. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the cerebellum, and the parcellations we generated provide context for future research into the pontocerebellar tract's involvement in health and disease.","[Rousseau, Paul-Noel; Steele, Christopher J.] Concordia Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chakravarty, M.

The functions of OFC neurons within this domain have been studied extensively in both rats and primates. Electrophysiological recordings during performance of relevant behavioral tasks provide a coherent portrait of OFC encoding that is reward related. OFC neurons represent associative relationships between events, encoding information that is predictive of outcome value. That encoding can be understood as a neural basis for deficits seen after OFC damage in the use of outcome expectancy to guide performance. There is less agreement, however, on whether OFC itself plays a role in translating information on outcome expectancy into the actual guidance of overt behavioral responding. New findings indicate that rat OFC neurons prominently encode additional task-related information and events related to goal-directed action. This encoding can occur in populations of OFC neurons that are independent of the OFC neurons representing reward value. The significance of this emerging evidence may require studies that address the larger scale network through which OFC integrates expected outcome information with behavioral control.","[Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki; Gallagher, Michela] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Johns Hopkins University","Furuyashiki, T (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Ames Hall,3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","tfurnya1@jhu.cdu","Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/AAG-5283-2019; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/B-8760-2014","Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/0000-0001-8089-8399; Furuyashiki, Tomoyuki/0000-0001-8089-8399","NIMH NIH HHS [R01-MH060 179] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))",,,153,23,23,0,2,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0077-8923",,"978-1-57331-683-5","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.",,2007,1121,,,,,,193,215,,"10.1196/annals.1401.037","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.037"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.037"")",,,23,"Behavioral Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Behavioral Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry","BHD18",17872389,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000252265300013","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000252265300013"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The purpose of this study is to define the cortical regions that subserve voluntary saccadic eye movements and spatial working memory in humans. 2. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during performance of oculomotor tasks was measured with [O-15]-H2O positron emission tomography (PET). Eleven well-trained, healthy young adults performed the following tasks: visual fixation, visually guided saccades, antisaccades (a task in which subjects made saccades away from rather than toward peripheral targets), and either an oculomotor delayed response (ODR, a task requiring memory-guided saccades after a delay period) or a conditional antisaccade task (a task in which the color of the peripheral target determined whether a saccade toward or away from the target was required). An additional six subjects performed a sequential hand movement task to compare localization of hand-related motor cortex and the frontal eye fields (FEFs) and of the hand- and eye-movement-related regions of the supplementary motor area (SMA). 3. Friston's statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method was used to identify significant changes in rCBF associated with task performance. Because SPM does not take advantage of the anatomic information available in magnetic resonance (MR) scans, each subject's PET scan was registered to that individual's MR scan, after which all PET and MR studies were transformed to conform to a standard reference MR image set. Subtraction images were visually inspected while overlayed on the reference MR scan to which PET images had been aligned, in order to confirm anatomic localization of significant rCBF changes. 4. Compared with visual fixation, performing visually guided saccades led to a significant bilateral activation in FEF, cerebellum, striate cortex, and posterior temporal cortex. Right posterior thalamus activation was also observed. 5. The visually guided saccade task served as the comparison task for the ODR, antisaccade, and conditional antisaccade tasks for identification of task-related changes in rCBF beyond those associated with saccade execution. Performance on the ODR task was associated with a bilateral increase of rCBF in FEFs, SMA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior parietal cortex. The cortical regions of increased regional blood flow during the ODR task also showed increased rCBF during the antisaccade task; however, FEF and SMA activations were significant only in the right hemisphere. These findings closely parallel those of single-cell recording studies with behaving monkeys in indicating that FEF, DLPFC, SMA, and posterior parietal cortex perform computational activity for voluntary purposive saccades. 6. Comparison of PET scans obtained during performance of eye movement and hand movement tasks indicated that peak activations in FEF were located similar to 2 cm lateral and 1 cm anterior to those of hand-related motor cortex. The oculomotor area of SMA, the supplementary eye field (SEF), was located similar to 7-8 mm anterior and superior to the hand-related area of SMA. 7. During performance of antisaccade and ODR tasks, rCBF was significantly lower in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), along the rectus gyrus, and in ventral anterior cingulate cortex than during the visually guided saccade and fixation tasks. During the antisaccade task, the ventral region of lower rCBF involved medial structures including left ventral striatum and bilateral medial temporal-limbic cortex. During the ODR task, the ventral aspect of the region of lower rCBF extended laterally, rather than medially, to include the temporal poles. The lower blood flow observed in ventromedial PFC during both the antisaccade and ODR tasks, relative to the visually guided saccade and fixation tasks, suggests that modulation of output from ventromedial PFC to limbic cortex and the striatum may play a role in the voluntary control of saccadic eye movements, possibly in the suppression of responses that would interrupt ongoing purposive behavior. 8. During the ODR task, rCBF changes in DLPFC, FEF, SMA, posterior parietal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate, and orbital frontal cortex were highly intercorrelated. A similar pattern of activation across cortical regions was observed during the antisaccade task, with the exception that activation in SMA was independent from rCBF changes observed in other cortical regions. These findings suggest that widely distributed neural circuitry mediates the voluntary control of saccades in humans.","UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT PSYCHIAT, NEUROBEHAV STUDIES PROGRAM, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT RADIOL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA; UNIV PITTSBURGH, SCH MED, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh",,,"anand, amit/A-7222-2009","Brown, Devin/0000-0002-9815-3421; Sweeney, John/0000-0003-1752-2828; Kwee, Sandi/0000-0002-4624-8787","PHS HHS [R01-42969, P50-45156, P30-49815] Funding Source: Medline","PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,78,485,488,0,23,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Six patients with Parkinson's disease off medication and six age-matched normals were assessed All subjects had regional cerebral blood pow (rCBF) measurement with PET and recording of movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) from frontal (F), fronto-central (FC), central (C) and parietal (P) sites to obtain measures of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). The tasks were (i) self-initiated extension of the right index finger on average once every 3 s, (ii) externally triggered finger extension with the rate yoked to the self-initiated task, and (iii) rest condition with tones presented at a rate yoked with the self-initiated task. For the self-initiated movements, the amplitude of the early and peak BP were lower in Parkinson's disease relative to normals. For the externally triggered movements, the patients and the normals did not differ on any of the measures of cortical negativity prior to movement For both groups, the late and peak BP components, but not the early component, had a lower amplitude in the externally triggered than the self-initiated movements. In normals, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary motor area bilaterally anterior cingulate, the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally the insular cortex bilaterally, the left thalamus and the left putamen, parietal area 40 bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were significantly activated during the self-initiated movements relative to rest. For the normals, greater activation of the right DLPFC during the self-initiated movements was the only area that significantly differentiated them from the externally triggered movements. When Parkinson's disease patients and normals were compared for the self-initiated movements relative to rest, normals showed greater activation of the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, left putamen, left insular cortex, right DLPFC and right parietal area 40. When the groups were compared for the externally triggered movements relative to rest the global pattern of blood pow and rCBF change in the two groups did not differ, confirming the absence of group differences in BPs for the externally triggered movements. During the self-initiated movements, the lower amplitude of the early BP in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the underactivation of the supplementary motor area relative to normals support the premises that (i) the supplementary motor area contributes to the early BT: and (ii) the deficit in self-initiated movements in Parkinson's disease is due to supplementary motor area underactivation. The DLPFC is activated in situations requiring non-routine decision making as in the self-initiated movements.","UCL NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, NEUROL INST, DEPT CLIN NEUROL, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND; HAMMERSMITH HOSP, MRC, CYCLOTRON UNIT, LONDON W12 0HS, ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND","University of London; University College London; UCL Medical School; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Imperial College London; University of Oxford","JAHANSHAHI, M (corresponding author), UCL NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, MRC, HUMAN MOVEMENT & BALANCE UNIT, QUEEN SQ, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND.",,"Brown, Richard G/A-9599-2010","Brown, Richard G/0000-0001-9021-0172; Brooks, David/0000-0003-2602-2518","Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,82,820,826,2,44,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950",,,"BRAIN","Brain","AUG",1995,118,,4,,,,913,933,,"10.1093/brain/118.4.913","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/118.4.913"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/118.4.913"")",,,21,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","RU634",7655888,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1995RU63400007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1995RU63400007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Hence, projections involved in higher order cognitive processes might be expected to exhibit a lower degree of collateralization than projections that mediate more basic brain functions. This study sought to determine the degree to which neurons projecting from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens collateralize to major cortical and subcortical regions: the contralateral prefrontal cortex, the basolateral amygdala or the ventral tegmental area. Fluoro-Gold and cholera toxin-b were used to label prefrontal cortex neurons that project to these targets, and the proportion of neurons singly and dually labeled by immunofluorescence for these tracers was determined. The prefrontal cortex neurons projecting to these regions exhibited a partially complementary laminar distribution. Furthermore, of the neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens, 13% sent a collateralized projection to the contralateral prefrontal cortex, 7% collateralized to the basolateral amygdala, and 3% sent a branched projection to the ventral tegmental area. No differences were observed in the degree of collateralization of neurons in superficial versus deep layers. Thus, the degree of collateralization of corticoaccumbens neurons was overall limited, but significantly greater to a cortical target than to subcortical regions. These branching patterns provide anatomical substrates for temporal and spatial coordination of activity in limbic circuits. (C) 2000 IBRO.

By design, the two motor tasks differed in the cognitive processing required, In each trial of immediate pointing, the spatial location of only the most recent target needed to be processed, In each trial of pointing to the previous, instead, while the most recent target was stored in memory for the movement of the next trial, the previous target had to be retrieved from memory to direct the current movement, Limb trajectories were comparable between the two motor tasks in terms of most spatiotemporal parameters examined. Significant rCBF increases were identified using analysis of covariance and t statistics. Compared with visual detection there was activation of primary sensorimotor cortex, ventrolateral precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus in the opercular region, supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, all these sites in the hemisphere (left) contralateral to the moving limb, and cerebellar vermis, during both immediate pointing and pointing to the previous. During immediate pointing there was additional activation of left inferior parietal lobule close to the intraparietal sulcus, and when compared with pointing to the previous, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. During pointing to the previous, instead, there was additional activation of supplementary motor cortex, anterior and midcingulate, and inferior occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere; superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior hippocampus in the right hemisphere; lingual gyri acid cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally; anterior thalamus; and pulvinar. The activation of two partially distinct cerebral networks in these two motor tasks reflects the different nature of signal processing involved. In particular, the specific activation of intraparietal sulcus and prefrontal cortex in immediate pointing appears characteristic of a network for visuospatial working memory. By contrast, the corticolimbic network engaged in pointing to the previous could mediate spatial attention and the sequence of encoding, recoding, and decoding of spatial memories required by a dual task with two competing targets.

As to the relay cells in cats' lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), they also have weak but significant orientation bias (OB). It is thus of interest to investigate the fine spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) properties in LGN, compare them with the dynamics of orientation tuning, and examine the dynamic relationship between STRF and orientation sensitivity in LGN. We mapped the STRFs of the LGN neurons in cats with white noise and characterized the dynamics of the orientation tuning by flashing gratings. We found that most of the LGN neurons showed elongated RFs and that the elongation axes were consistent with the preferred orientations. STRFs and the dynamics of orientation tuning were closely correlated temporally: the elongation of RFs and OB emerged, peaked and decayed at the same pace, with unchanged elongation axis of RF and preferred orientation but consistently changing aspect ratio of RF and OB strength across time. Importantly, the above consistency between RF and orientation tuning was not influenced by the ablation of the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, biased orientation tuning emerged 20-30 ms earlier than those in the primary visual cortex. These data demonstrated that similar to the primary visual cortex, the orientation sensitivity was closely reflected by the RF properties in LGN.

Here we asked whether trichromats express chromatic-specific circuitry in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The volume of parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K) layers was calculated in Nissl-stained sections from the LGN of adult marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; 10 trichromatic females; 2 dichromatic females; and 13 dichromatic males). Retinal ganglion cell axon terminals within the P and K layers were reconstructed and measured following anterograde tracer (dextran) injections. We show that there is little difference in LGN layer volume with respect to age, weight, or sex of the animals, or between dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes. The morphology of retinal ganglion cell terminals was largely indistinguishable on comparing dichromats and trichromats, and likewise on comparing terminals representing peripheral or foveal retina. We conclude that the LGN circuits we studied are largely independent of red-green color vision phenotype and visual field location.

Here we describe two independent but also interrelated visual systems, one cortical and the other subcortical, both of which have been modified and expanded in primates for different functions. Available evidence suggests that while the cortical visual system mainly functions to give primates the ability to assess and adjust to fluid social and ecological environments, the subcortical visual system appears to function as a rapid detector and first responder when time is of the essence, i.e., when survival requires very quick action. We focus here on the subcortical visual system with a review of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that demonstrates its sensitivity to particular, often emotionally charged, ecological and social stimuli, i.e., snakes and fearful and aggressive facial expressions in conspecifics. We also review the literature on subcortical involvement during another, less emotional, situation that requires rapid detection and response-visually guided reaching and grasping during locomotion-to further emphasize our argument that the subcortical visual system evolved as a rapid detector/first responder, a function that remains in place today. Finally, we argue that investigating deficits in this subcortical system may provide greater understanding of Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD).","[Soares, Sandra C.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Educ & Psychol, CINTESIS UA, Aveiro, Portugal; [Soares, Sandra C.; Maior, Rafael S.] Karolinska Inst, Div Psychol, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Soares, Sandra C.] Inst Super Psicol Aplicada, William James Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Maior, Rafael S.; Tomaz, Carlos] Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Dept Physiol Sci, Ctr Primate, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Tomaz, Carlos] Ceuma Univ, Neurosci Res Coordinat, Sao Luis, Brazil; [Nishijo, Hisao] Toyama Univ, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Syst Emot Sci, Toyama, Japan","Universidade de Aveiro; Karolinska Institutet; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Universidade de Brasilia; University of California System; University of California Davis; Universidade Ceuma; University of Toyama","Nishijo, H (corresponding author), Toyama Univ, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Syst Emot Sci, Toyama, Japan.","nishijo@med.u-toyama.ac.jp","Tomaz, Carlos A B/F-8626-2012; Maior, Rafael S./F-3994-2012; Tomaz, Carlos/AAU-1524-2020; Soares, Sandra/K-5576-2013","Maior, Rafael S./0000-0001-7219-8675; Tomaz, Carlos/0000-0001-7341-0922; Soares, Sandra/0000-0002-0346-7840","Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan [16H04652]; FEDER - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao-COMPETE2020 [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007746]; National Funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia within CINTESIS, RD Unit; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H04652] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); FEDER - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao-COMPETE2020; National Funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia within CINTESIS, RD Unit(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported partly by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (16H04652) from Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS), Japan, and by FEDER through the operation POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007746 funded by the Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao-COMPETE2020 and by National Funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia within CINTESIS, R&D Unit.",,303,51,51,0,15,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,"1662-453X",,"FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ","Front.

These components can be difficult to dissociate using retrospective autobiographical stimuli collection. In this study, we manipulated biographical the episodic/semantic distinction within prospectively collected autobiographical stimuli. Over several months, participants made recordings documenting specific episodes, repeated episodes, and world knowledge. These recordings were later played back to participants during scanning with functional MRI. The results indicated overlapping but distinct patterns of brain activity corresponding to episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Both episodic and semantic autobiographical memory engaged the left anteromedial prefrontal cortex associated with self-reference, but the episodic condition did so to a greater degree. The episodic condition uniquely engaged the medial temporal, posterior cingulate, and diencephalic regions associated with remote memory recovery. Whereas the episodic condition engaged the right temporo-parietal cortex involved in reconstruction of spatial context and attentional orienting, the semantic condition engaged the left temporo-parietal and parieto-frontal systems involved in egocentric spatial processing and top-down attentional control. Episodic recollection was also associated with suppression of emotional paralimbic regions. These findings support a functional neuroanatomical dissociation between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory, providing concordance to amnesic syndromes with disproportionate impairment in one of these two forms of autobiographical memory.","Baycrest Ctr Geriatr Care, Rotman Res Inst, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Sunnybrook & Womens Coll, Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada","University of Toronto; Baycrest; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute","Levine, B (corresponding author), Baycrest Ctr Geriatr Care, Rotman Res Inst, 3560 Bathurst St, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada.","levine@psych.utoronto.ca","Levine, Brian/G-4328-2010; McIntosh, Anthony R/G-4955-2011","Levine, Brian/0000-0003-4343-811X; McIntosh, Anthony/0000-0002-1784-5662",,,,,69,192,193,1,27,"MIT PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA","0898-929X","1530-8898",,"J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI","J.

Objective: To investigate the spatial relationship between WM lesions and deep GM atrophy. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study (3 Tesla) in 249 patients with clinically-isolated syndrome or relapsing-remitting MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale score: median, 1.0; range, 0-4) and in 49 healthy controls. Preprocessing of T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated T2-weighted images resulted in normalized GM images and WM lesion probability maps. We performed two voxel-wise analyses: 1. We localized GM atrophy and confirmed that it is most pronounced within deep GM; 2. We searched for a spatial relationship between WM lesions and deep GM atrophy; to this end we analyzed WM lesion probability maps by voxel-wise multiple regression, including four variables derived from maxima of regional deep GM atrophy (caudate and pulvinar, each left and right). Results: Atrophy of each deep GM region was explained by ipsilateral WM lesion probability, in the area most densely connected to the respective deep GM region. Conclusion: We demonstrated that WM lesions and deep GM atrophy are spatially related. Our results are best compatible with the hypothesis that WM lesions contribute to deep GM atrophy through axonal pathology.","[Muehlau, Mark; Buck, Dorothea; Boucard, Christine C.; Arsic, Milan; Schmidt, Paul; Berthele, Achim; Hoshi, Muna; Jochim, Angela; Kronsbein, Helena; Hemmer, Bernhard; Ilg, Ruediger] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Foerschler, Annette; Zimmer, Claus] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Neuroradiol, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Schmidt, Paul] Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany; [Gaser, Christian] Univ Jena, Dept Neurol, Jena, Germany; [Gaser, Christian] Univ Jena, Dept Psychiat, Jena, Germany","Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Munich; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena","Muhlau, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Neurol, Ismaningerstr 22, D-81675 Munich, Germany.","muehlau@lrz.tum.de","Hemmer, Bernhard/AAT-8388-2021; Hemmer, Bernhard/GPX-8451-2022; Hemmer, Bernhard/AAU-3066-2021; TUM, Forschung Neurorad/C-1202-2014; Gaser, Christian/F-5103-2010; Forschler, Annette/O-9390-2015","Hemmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-5985-6784; Hemmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-5985-6784; Gaser, Christian/0000-0002-9940-099X; Schmidt, Paul/0000-0002-1676-1774; Boucard, Christine Claudia/0000-0003-2634-869X; Forschler, Annette/0000-0001-9665-5228","German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF); Merck Serono;  [01EV07099]","German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Merck Serono(Merck & Company); ","This work was supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) to B.H., M.M.

The development of excitatory activation in the visual cortex was studied in fetal and neonatal cats. During fetal and neonatal life, the immature cerebral cortex (the cortical plate) is sandwiched between two synaptic zones: the marginal zone above, and an area just below the cortical plate, the subplate. The subplate is transient and disappear by approximately 2 mo postnatal. Here we have investigated whether the subplate and the cortical plate receive functional synaptic inputs in the fetus, and when the adultlike pattern of excitatory synaptic input to the cortical plate appears during development. 2. Extracellular field potential recording to electrical stimulation of the optic radiation was performed in slices of cerebral cortex maintained in vitro. Laminar profiles of field potentials were converted by the current-source density (CSD) method to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of neuronal excitation within the subplate and the cortical plate. 3. Between embryonic day 47 (E47) and postnatal day 28 (P28; birth, E65), age-related changes occur in the pattern of synaptic activation of neurons in the cortical plate and the subplate. Early in development, at E47, E57, and P0, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation is most obvious in the subplate, and longer latency (presumably polysynaptic) excitation can be seen in the cortical plate. Synaptic excitation in the subplate is no longer apparent at P21 and P28, a time when cell migration is finally complete and the cortical layers have formed. By contrast, excitation in the cortical plate is prominent in postnatal animals, and the temporal and spatial pattern has changed. 4. The adultlike sequence of synaptic activation in the different cortical layers can be seen by P28. It differs from earlier ages in several respects. First, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation can be detected in cortical layer 4. Second, multisynaptic, long-lasting activation is present in layers 2/3 and 5. 5. Our results show that the subplate zone, known from anatomic studies to be a synaptic neurophil during development, receives functional excitatory inputs from axons that course in the developing white matter. Because the only mature neurons present in this zone are the subplate neurons, we conclude that subplate neurons are the principal, if not the exclusive, recipients of this input. The results suggest further that the excitation in the subplate in turn is relayed to neurons of the cortical plate via axon collaterals of subplate neurons. Thus an intrinsic set of microcircuits is formed in the developing cerebral cortex that exists only transiently during perinatal life and disappears as subplate neurons are eliminated by programmed cell death after birth. 6. Although the ultimate role of these microcircuits in cortical development is unknown, we suggest that subplate neurons, through synaptic function, may act as a crucial temporary link between forming afferent axonal systems from the thalamus and their final targets, the layer 4 cortical neurons.",,,"FRIAUF, E (corresponding author), STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.",,"Friauf, Eckhard/D-7529-2012","Friauf, Eckhard/0000-0002-1833-1698","NEI NIH HHS [EY-02858] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,72,139,141,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Four healthy volunteers (27-46 years) were subjected to positron emission tomographic (PET) investigation of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using [O-15]butanol as tracer. The ethanol (20 mu l, 70%) and saline (20 mu l, 0.9%) were injected intracutaneously 3 times in a single-blinded, semi-randomised manner for the pain experiment. All the injections were performed, adjacent to each other, at the lateral aspect of the right upper arm. Subjective sensory intensity of pain, unpleasantness and anxiety were rated with separate 100-mm visual analogue scales together with the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al. 1970) and heart rate. Paired-subtraction (pixel-by-pixel) between ethanol and saline was performed. Traumatic pain significantly caused higher ratings of intensity and affect scales, i.e., pain intensity, unpleasantness and increased sympathetic activity (evidenced by tachycardia). In contrast the anxiety rating remained unchanged. Acute traumatic nociceptive pain prominently activated the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray (FAG). In addition, activations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), insular, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); posterior parietal cortex (PPC), primary motor/somatosensory areas (MI/SI: face, upper arm), supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum were also demonstrated, The central processing of the pain-relevant/anticipatory arousal also engaged the FAG. This study demonstrates the involvement of the human cerebral cortex in perception, arousal, cognitive evaluative processes, and, hence, affective reactions (somatic/autonomic outflow) associated with pain. The pain stimulus of traumatic character may, by its very nature, evoke the central processing to involve both the hypothalamus and the FAG.","KAROLINSKA HOSP, DEPT CLIN NEUROSCI, CLIN NEUROPHYSIOL SECT, KAROLINSKA INST, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, KAROLINSKA INST, DEPT DERMATOL, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; KAROLINSKA HOSP, KAROLINSKA INST, KAROLINSKA PHARM, S-17176 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; NATL YANG MING UNIV, VET GEN HOSP, SECT NEUROANESTHESIA, TAIPEI 11217, TAIWAN; NATL YANG MING UNIV, VET GEN HOSP, DEPT ANESTHESIOL, PAIN UNIT, TAIPEI 11217, TAIWAN; NATL YANG MING UNIV, SCH MED, TAIPEI 11217, TAIWAN","Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University",,,,"Hsieh, Jen-Chuen/0000-0002-7568-000X; Ingvar, Martin/0000-0002-9041-5714",,,,,93,178,180,0,4,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","PHILADELPHIA","TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","0304-3959","1872-6623",,"PAIN","Pain","FEB",1996,64,2,,,,,303,314,,"10.1016/0304-3959(95)00129-8","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(95)00129-8"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3959(95)00129-8"")",,,12,"Anesthesiology; Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Anesthesiology; Neurosciences & Neurology","UJ288",8740608,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1996UJ28800012","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1996UJ28800012"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

All cortical sites responding to specific noxious inputs also responded to nonnoxious stimuli, while the reverse was not always true. Evoked responses in S1 area 3b were systematic for nonnoxious inputs, but seen in only half of cases after nociceptive stimulation. Nociceptive responses were systematically recorded when electrode tracks reached the crown of the postcentral gyrus, consistent with an origin in somatosensory areas 1-2. Sites in the precentral cortex also exhibited noxious and nonnoxious responses with phase reversals indicating a local origin in area 4 (M1). We conclude that a representation of thermal nociceptive information does exist in human S1, although to a much lesser extent than the nonnociceptive one. Notably, area 3b, which responds massively to nonnoxious A beta activation was less involved in the processing of noxious heat. S1 and M1 responses to noxious heat occurred at latencies comparable to those observed in the supra-sylvian opercular region of the same patients, suggesting a parallel, rather than hierarchical, processing of noxious inputs in S1, M1 and opercular cortex.

Gender differences in emotion processing are a common finding in functional neuroimaging studies, and have been documented in behavioral studies of humor, but have received limited attention in functional neuroimaging studies on humor. Using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrasts with high-field (31) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR) we investigated 29 healthy subjects (14 female, 15 male) during the processing of humorous cartoons. In women, the ventral system implicated in detection and appraisal of emotion was activated, including amygdala, insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Men showed activation in both the ventral and dorsal processing systems. The results indicate that women process humor though limbic reactivity, involving appraisal of its emotional features, while men apply more evaluative, executive resources to humor processing.

Intracellular recordings were made from 43 spinothalamic (STT) neurons in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord in anesthetized macaque monkeys. The antidromic responses of these neurons to electrical stimulation of the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus were examined, and orthodromic responses to electrical stimulation of the sural nerve or to mechanical stimulation of hindlimb skin were recorded to study the electrophysiological features of these neurons and their responses to afferent inputs. 2. The resting membrane potential of the neurons ranged from -26 to -70 mV and the antidromic latency from 2.3 to 9.1 ms. Three of the neurons were located in lamina I and were recorded so briefly that only antidromic and spontaneous activity could be studied. The rest of the neurons were located in laminae III-V and were of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) type. 3. The antidromic action potentials recorded in the somas of STT neurons typically showed a fast rising phase and a short initial segment-somadendritic (IS-SD) delay. After repetitive antidromic stimulation, a progressive elongation of the IS-SD delay, widening of the spike, and failure of the SD spike were observed. 4. The afterpotential of the antidromic action potential consisted of a fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP(f)) and sometimes a delayed depolarization (DD) and a slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP(s)). The amplitude and the duration of the AHP(s) were progressively increased when longer trains of stimuli were used. When the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, the amplitude of the AHP(s) decreased, suggesting an involvement of K+ and/or Cl- ions. However, the AHP(s) completely disappeared when the strength of stimulation was adjusted to a level just below the threshold for the axon, suggesting that it was unlikely that recurrent inhibition contributed to the AHP(s). 5. The background activity of 32 STT neurons was analyzed. The membrane potential at which spikes were triggered in these neurons was around -42 mV. The width and the rise time of the spontaneous spikes were shorter than those of antidromic action potentials, although the maximum rate of rise was similar. The heights of the spontaneous spikes were slightly shorter than those of antidromic action potentials. 6. Three types of background activity have been observed. One type had a very low average spontaneous rate with a bursting firing pattern, consisting of a few spikes superimposed on a depolarization. This type of activity was seen mostly in lamina I neurons. The second type of activity had moderate to high spontaneous rate with a fairly constant interval between spikes. The slowly rising membrane potential between each pair of spikes resembled a pacemaker potential. The third type of activity was a mixture of the previous two. 7. The background firing rates of neurons recorded both extracellularly and intracellularly were not significantly different. Linear correlation analysis showed that the resting membrane potential recorded intracellularly was highly correlated with the height and the width of the antidromic action potential, but was not correlated with the background firing rate of STT neurons recorded intracellularly. 8. Electrical stimulation of the sural nerve evoked depolarizations and discharges in 35 STT neurons tested. Judged by the threshold and the latency of the evoked activity, three components could be distinguished corresponding to A-beta-, A-delta-, and C-afferent inputs. These depolarizations were all excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), because the amplitude of the evoked depolarization was increased (or decreased) when the membrane potential was artifically hyperpolarized (or depolarized). 9. The threshold for EPSPs evoked by A-delta-input (A-delta-EPSPs) was about 5 times the threshold (5T) for the EPSPS evoked by A-beta-input (A-beta-EPSPs). In most cases, the A-delta-EPSPs could be separated from the A-beta-EPSPs by a small dip in the membrane potential and a discontinuation of spike discharges at that time. Furthermore, the membrane conductance increased more during the A-beta-EPSPs than during the A-delta-EPSPs, judging by the amplitudes of the spikes superimposed on the EPSPs. The latency of the potentials evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded in the dorsal horn indicated that at least some of the A-beta- and A-delta-EPSPs were evoked by monosynaptic input. 10. In 28 of 35 neurons, EPSPs evoked by C-afferent input (C-EPSPs) were recorded after single shock stimulation of the sural nerve. The threshold for the C-EPSPs was approximately 100T, and stronger stimuli evoked larger responses. 11. Repetitive stimulation (2 Hz) of the sural nerve was used to study the C-EPSPs in 13 STT neurons. Some neurons displayed a very synchronized C-EPSP pattern with a reliable latency, whereas some neurons had an unsynchronized or a mixed response pattern. Both incremental increases (wind-up) or decreases (wind-down) of the C-EPSP were observed during repetitive stimulation. In the case of wind-up of the C-EPSP, there was concurrently a wind-down of the A-afferent-evoked response in some neurons and a wind-up in other neurons. During repetitive stimulation, the membrane potential of the neurons recorded did not show any significant change. 12. Hyperpolarizations followed the excitation of some STT neurons by A- or C-afferent inputs. The amplitude of these hyperpolarizations was smaller when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, suggesting that these potentials were inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). On the basis of the latency and other observations, the IPSPs were more likely to be evoked by small afferent (A-delta- and C-fibers) inputs than by A-beta-afferents. 13. Mechanical stimulation has been used to observe the pattern of EPSPs underlying evoked discharges in 3 STT neurons. Nociceptive stimuli, including pinching and squeezing, evoked larger EPSPs and a higher rate of discharge than did innocuous stimuli, such as brushing.","UNIV TEXAS,MED BRANCH,INST MARINE BIOMED,200 UNIV BLVD,GALVESTON,TX 77550; UNIV TEXAS,MED BRANCH,DEPT ANAT & NEUROSCI,GALVESTON,TX 77550","University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston",,,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS-11255, NS-09743] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,83,23,23,0,1,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

It was found that the DA-like fibers were distributed within the Paleostriatum augmentatum and the dorsal Archistriatum in a dense meshwork of fibers, while most of the remaining part of the caudal forebrain was innervated by dopaminergic axons which were coiled up like baskets around unlabelled neurons. Within the basket-type innervated structures, the Neostriatum caudolaterale (Ncl) could be distinguished by the high density of its dopaminergic fibers. Retrograde tracer injections into Ncl revealed afferents from the Area ventralis tegmentalis (AVT) and the n. tegmenti pedunculo-pontinus pars compacta (TPc). Since large numbers of DA-like perikarya could be detected in AVT and TPc, it is supposed that these two structures constitute the main source of the dopaminergic innervation of the Ncl. Previous studies had suggested that the Ncl represents an avian equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. The present results reveal an organization similar to that of the mesocortico-prefrontal system and would thus strengthen this hypothesis.","UNIV CONSTANCE, FACHBEREICH ALLGEMEINE PSYCHOL, W-7750 CONSTANCE, GERMANY","University of Konstanz","WALDMANN, C (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV, CTR MOLEC & BEHAV NEUROSCI, 197 UNIV AVE, NEWARK, NJ 07102 USA.",,"Waldmann, Christoph/F-3386-2017","Waldmann, Christoph/0000-0003-3388-7579; Gunturkun, Onur/0000-0003-4173-5233",,,,,72,115,116,0,4,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0006-8993","1872-6240",,"BRAIN RES","Brain Res.","JAN 15",1993,600,2,,,,,225,234,,"10.1016/0006-8993(93)91377-5","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(93)91377-5"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(93)91377-5"")",,,10,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","KG868",8435748,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1993KG86800007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1993KG86800007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

The study was carried out on male albino rats aged 3, 18, 24 and 28 months. In order to estimate the volume of the dLGN, neuronal volume density, numerical density and total number of neurons, we used serial sections stained according to the Kluver-Barrera technique and stereological methods. We found that dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus volume increases between 3 and 28 months, with a larger increase between 24 and 28 months. Neuronal volume density and numerical density of neurons are greater at 3 months and undergo a significant; decrease between 24 and 28 months. Finally, the total number of neurons is shown to be smaller in adult and old animals than in younger ones, even though no significant variations are found between 18 and 28 months. Furthermore, this study confirms the need to analyze the total number of neurons and not just neuronal density if we want to correctly evaluate some of the microscopic changes occurring during senescence.

This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.","Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England; Amedeo Avogadro Univ, Dept Neurol, Novara, Italy","University of London; University College London; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro","Trimble, MR (corresponding author), Inst Neurol, Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.","prof@mtrimble.wanadoo.co.uk","Cavanna, Andrea Eugenio/HJA-1725-2022; Li, Yiou/G-4991-2010","Cavanna, Andrea Eugenio/0000-0003-0925-1255; ",,,,,145,3549,3637,21,430,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","MAR",2006,129,,3,,,,564,583,,"10.1093/brain/awl004","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awl004"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awl004"")",,,20,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","013TY",16399806,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000235433800003","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000235433800003"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

With the present study, we wanted to examine the impact of emotional information on neural correlates of semantic priming, a well-established technique to investigate semantic processing. Stimuli were presented with a short SOA of 200 ms as subjects performed a lexical decision task during fMRI measurement. Seven experimental conditions were compared: positive/negative/neutral related, positive/negative/neutral unrelated, nonwords (all words were nouns). Behavioral data revealed a valence specific semantic priming effect (i.e., unrelated > related) only for neutral and positive related word pairs. On a neural level, the comparison of emotional over neutral relations showed activation in left anterior medial frontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Interactions for the different relations were located in left anterior part of the medial frontal cortex, cingulate regions, and right hippocampus (positive > neutral + negative) and left posterior part of medial frontal cortex (negative > neutral + positive). The results showed that emotional information have an influence on semantic association processes. While positive and neutral information seem to share a semantic network, negative relations might induce compensatory mechanisms that inhibit the spread of activation between related concepts. The neural correlates highlighted a distributed neural network, primarily involving attention, memory and emotion related processing areas in medial fronto-parietal cortices. The differentiation between anterior (positive) and posterior part (negative) of the medial frontal cortex was linked to the type of affective manipulation with more cognitive demands being involved in the automatic processing of negative information.

That is, connections between V1 and V2 in both directions were quite similar; in each case, the glutamatergic inputs could be classified as one of two types, Class 1B (formerly driver) and Class 2 (formerly modulator).

While a prominent and characteristic feature of this volumetric shift has been the disproportionate expansion of association cortex across our evolutionary lineage, descent with modification is apparent throughout all neural systems in both human and nonhuman primates. However, despite evidence for the ubiquitous and complex influence of evolutionary forces on brain biology, within the psychological sciences the vast majority of the literature on human brain evolution is entirely corticocentric. This selective focus has contributed to a flawed theoretical framework in which the evolution of association cortex is viewed as an isolated process, removed from the rest of the brain. Here, we review our current understanding of how evolutionary pressures have acted across anatomically and functionally coupled networks, highlighting the diverse set of rules and principles that govern human brain development. In doing so we challenge the systemic mischaracterization of human cognition and behavior as a competition that pits phylogenetically recent cortical territories against evolutionarily ancient subcortical and cerebellar systems. Rather, we propose a comprehensive view of human brain evolution with critical importance for the use of animal models, theory development, and network-focused approaches in the study of behavior across health and disease.","[Chin, Rowena; Chang, Steve W.

We used stereological methods to estimate the volume of the superficial layers, neuron size, and the number of neurons and glial cells in Wistar male rats aged 3, 24, 26, and 28 months. A 32.6% volume increase was found in the stratum griseum superficiale between the ages of 3 and 26 months, while in the 28-month-old animals a 19% decrease was observed. The stratum opticum did not show any changes in volume with age. Also, our analysis revealed a process of somatic and nuclear atrophy in the neurons of the superficial layers in animals aged 26 and 28 months. On the other hand, no statistically significant differences were found in the numbers of neurons. The number of glial cells in the stratum griseum superficiale showed an increase between the 3rd and 26th month, while the stratum opticum suffered no change.

Recordings were made from the lumbosacral spinal cord in anesthetized macaque monkeys. The inhibitory effects of electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the cerebral cortex or cerebral peduncle (CP) were tested and compared by recording 1) cord dorsum potentials evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve, 2) discharges recorded extracellularly, and 3) membrane potentials recorded intracellularly from spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons at rest (background activity) or in response to stimulation of the sural nerve. 2. Stimulation of the cortex or in the CP preferentially reduced the amplitude of the N1 and N2 waves of the cord dorsum potential evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve, without affecting the N3 wave. Stimulation of the PAG, on the other hand, reduced the amplitude of the N3 wave with little effect on the N1 and N2 waves. 3. The activity of 62 STT neurons was recorded extracellularly. Stimulation of the PAG or the cortex/CP inhibited nonpreferentially the responses of the neurons in the superficial laminae to all afferent inputs. On the other hand, stimulation of the PAG or the cortex/CP inhibited preferentially the responses of most STT neurons in deep layers of the dorsal horn to the small or large afferent input, respectively. 4. Thirty-five neurons were recorded intracellularly. The membrane potential of the neurons averaged -45.5 +/- 10.1 (SD) mV. All neurons were recorded in laminae III-VI; the neurons were of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) type and had background activity. 5. The inhibitory effects of stimulation of the PAG were tested on all 35 neurons. In 32 of the neurons, stimulation of the PAG evoked a hyperpolarization. The background activity of the neurons was reduced (generally it completely ceased) by the hyperpolarization. In three neurons stimulation of the PAG did not evoke a hyperpolarization and the background activity of the neurons did not change. Nevertheless, the responses of these three neurons to afferent input were inhibited by stimulation in the PAG. 6. The inhibitory effects of stimulating the cortex and/or the CP were tested in 26 of the 35 neurons. Stimulation of the cortex and/or the CP evoked a hyperpolarization in all the neurons, although, in 10 of the 26 neurons, stimulation of the CP also evoked a depolarization. The hyperpolarization generally blocked the background activity of the neurons. 7. The effective stimuli in the PAG and the cortex/CP to evoke a hyperpolarization in STT neurons were short, high-frequency trains of pulses. Temporal summation seemed necessary to maintain an effective inhibition of the background activity and the responses of the neurons to afferent inputs. 8. The hyperpolarizations evoked in 5 of 21 neurons after stimulation of the PAG and in 5 of 14 neurons after stimulation of the cortex and/or the CP were inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). The IPSPs observed were characterized by an increased (or decreased) amplitude during artificial depolarization (or hyperpolarization) of the membrane potential and an increased membrane conductance during the time course of the IPSPs. 9. The evoked IPSPs usually blocked the background activity of STT neurons completely. No preferential inhibition of the responses of the neurons to A-beta-, A-delta-, and C-afferent inputs was found in STT neurons when stimulation of the PAG and the cortex/CP evoked IPSPs. 10. The hyperpolarizations observed in other STT neurons were quite different from IPSPs. The amplitudes of these hyperpolarizations increased (or decreased) when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized (or depolarized) artificially by injecting DC current, just opposite to the changes observed during IPSPs. Furthermore, there was a slightly decreased membrane conductance during the hyperpolarizations. Such characteristics suggested that the hyperpolarizations reflected a disfacilitation. Disfacilitation has been found in 16 neurons after stimulation of the PAG, and in 9 neurons after stimulation of the cortex/CP. 11. In seven neurons, disfacilitation was evoked by stimulation of both the PAG and the cortex/CP, and so the inhibitory effects could be compared. In these neurons, stimulation in the PAG inhibited the responses to small afferent (A-delta- and C-fibers) inputs to STT neurons more than the cortex did, whereas stimulation of the cortex inhibited the responses to A-beta-afferent input more. 12. It is postulated that IPSPs are suitable for controlling the general sensitivity of STT neurons and that disfacilitation is more suitable for controlling selectively the type of afferent input to the neurons so that the coding properties of the neurons can be switched according to various behavioral states.","UNIV TEXAS, MED BRANCH, INST MARINE BIOMED, 200 UNIV BLVD, GALVESTON, TX 77550 USA; UNIV TEXAS, MED BRANCH, DEPT ANAT & NEUROSCI, GALVESTON, TX 77550 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston",,,,,"NINDS NIH HHS [NS-09743, NS-11255] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,68,32,32,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598",,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

Monkeys were required to fixate the visual target to obtain a drop of apple juice as reward. We found that the probability of eliciting saccades increased with increases in the delay of electrical stimulation relative to target onset. Also, the current threshold to evoke saccades decreased as electrical stimulation was delivered later following target onset. There were major differences in the magnitude of this effect with stimulation of the DMFC versus the FEF. The current threshold to evoke saccades from the DMFC was 16 times greater when electrical stimulation was delivered 200 ms after target onset as compared to when it was delayed 200 ms after target offset. In contrast, the current threshold to evoke saccades from the FEFs was only three times greater when stimulation was delivered under similar conditions. These results suggest that the FEF are more closely connected with the saccade generator for the execution of saccadic eye movements than is the DMFC, even though both regions have direct projections to brainstem oculomotor centres.","MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Tehovnik, EJ (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-634, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,"Slocum, Warren/0000-0003-2923-6730","NEI NIH HHS [EY08502] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,64,36,36,0,2,"BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

These brain sex differences present two main characteristics: they are seen in neural circuits related to sexual behavior and sexual physiology and they take one of two opposite morphological patterns (male > female or female > male). The present work reports sex differences in the olfactory system in a large homogeneous sample of men (40) and women (51) using of voxel-based morphology. Gray matter concentration showed sexual dimorphism in several olfactory regions. Women have a higher concentration in the orbitofrontal cortex involving Brodmann's areas 10, 11 and 25 and temporomedial cortex (bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala), as well as their left basal insular cortex. In contrast, men show a higher gray matter concentration in the left entorhinal cortex (Brodmann's area 28), right ventral pallidum, dorsal left insular cortex and a region of the orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 25).

The societies of spotted hyenas are remarkably like those of cercopithecine primates with respect to size, structure and patterns of competition and cooperation. These similarities set an ideal stage for comparative analysis of social intelligence and nervous system organization. As in cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities to recognize their kin and other conspecifics as individuals, they recognize third-party kin and rank relationships among their clan mates, and they use this knowledge adaptively during social decision making. However, hyenas appear to rely more intensively than primates on social facilitation and simple rules of thumb in social decision making. No evidence to date suggests that hyenas are capable of true imitation. Finally, it appears that the gross anatomy of the brain in spotted hyenas might resemble that in primates with respect to expansion of frontal cortex, presumed to be involved in the mediation of social behaviour.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Michigan State Univ Museum, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University","Holekamp, KE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.","holekamp@msu.edu","Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010",,,,,,148,101,103,1,87,"ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8436","1471-2970",,"PHILOS T R SOC B","Philos.

Functional neuroimaging studies have identified itch-related brain regions. However, no study has investigated the temporal aspect of itch-related brain processing. Here this issue was investigated using electrically evoked itch in ten healthy adults. Itch stimuli were applied to the left wrist and brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the MEG experiment, the magnetic responses evoked by the itch stimuli were observed in the contralateral and ipsilateral frontotemporal regions. The dipoles associated with the magnetic responses were mainly located in the contralateral (nine subjects) and ipsilateral (eight subjects) secondary somatosensory cortex (SII)/insula, which were also activated by the itch stimuli in the fMRI experiment. We also observed an itch-related magnetic response in the posterior part of the centroparietal region in six subjects. MEG and fMRI data showed that the magnetic response in this region was mainly associated with itch-related activation of the precuneus. The latency was significantly longer in the ipsilateral than that in the contralateral SII/insula, suggesting the difference to be associated with transmission in the callosal fibers. The timing of activation of the precuneus was between those of the contralateral and ipsilateral SII/insula. Other sources were located in the premotor, primary motor, and anterior cingulate cortices (one subject each). This study is the first to demonstrate part of the time course of itch-related brain processing. Combining methods with high temporal and spatial resolution (e.g., MEG and fMRI) would be useful to investigate the temporal aspect of the brain mechanism of itch.","[Mochizuki, Hideki; Inui, Koji; Otsuru, Naofumi; Yamashiro, Koya; Nakata, Hiroki; Kakigi, Ryusuke] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Integrat Physiol, Aichi, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroki C.; Sasaki, Akihiro; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cerebral Res, Aichi, Japan; [Nakata, Hiroki] Nagoya Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Aichi, Japan; [Mochizuki, Hideki] Japanese Fdn Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakata, Hiroki] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Inui, Koji; Tanabe, Hiroki C.; Otsuru, Naofumi; Yamashiro, Koya; Sasaki, Akihiro; Sadato, Norihiro; Kakigi, Ryusuke] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Life Sci, Dept Physiol Sci, Kanagawa, Japan; [Akiyama, Lisa F.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Akiyama, Lisa F.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Nagoya University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Mochizuki, H (corresponding author), Univ Heidelberg, CBTM, Dept Neurophysiol, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany.","hideki.mochizuki@medma.uni-heidelberg.de","Sasaki, Akihiro/C-3658-2017; Sasaki, Akihiro/AAH-9765-2021","Sasaki, Akihiro/0000-0002-2249-4975; Sasaki, Akihiro/0000-0002-2249-4975; Akiyama, Lisa/0000-0002-5867-7829; Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907","Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Japanese Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Japanese Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This work was supported in part by grants from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Research on Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases and Mental Health), Japanese Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health (Young Research Residents), and Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Young Scientists B).",,72,49,52,1,13,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

For example, after a unilateral lesion to striate cortex (V1), an abnormal anatomical pathway can develop between the lateral geniculate nucleus of the undamaged hemisphere and the motion area V5/MT+ in the damaged hemisphere, accompanied by a hypernormal callosal connection between the area V5/MT+ of the two hemispheres. Here we investigated, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the functional significance of these pathways in the blindsight subject GY, in whom they were first demonstrated. We show that TMS applied over the extrastriate area V5/MT+ in GY's damaged hemisphere modulates the appearance of phosphenes induced from V1 in the normal hemisphere. In contrast, in neurologically normal control subjects, TMS applied over V5/MT+ never influenced the phosphenes induced from V1 in the other hemisphere. The findings indicate an abnormal functional connectivity between V5/MT in the damaged hemisphere and the early visual cortex in the normal hemisphere, consistent with GY's abnormal anatomical connectivity.","[Cowey, Alan] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England; [Silvanto, Juha] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Walsh, Vincent] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Walsh, Vincent] UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1N 3AR, England","University of Oxford; University of Essex; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London","Cowey, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England.","juha@essex.ac.uk; alan.cowey@psy.ox.ac.uk",,"Silvanto, Juha/0000-0001-6044-5296","UCL graduate school research scholarship; MRC Grant; Wellcome Trust; MRC [G0601975] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0601975] Funding Source: researchfish","UCL graduate school research scholarship; MRC Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","J.

These patterns of neurodegeneration in humans have not yet been systematically related to developmental, connectional, cellular, and chemical factors studied in human and non-human primates, that may underlie potential differences in selective vulnerability across striatal sectors. Relating primate anatomy to human pathology could provide new venues for identifying molecular, cellular, and connectional factors linked to the degeneration of striatal neurons and circuits. This review describes and summarizes several developmental, cellular, structural, and connectional features of the primate striatum in relation to patterns of neurodegeneration in the striatum of humans and of non-human primate models. We review (1) the types of neurons in the primate striatum, (2) the cyto-, myelo-, and chemoarchitecture of the primate striatum, (3) the developmental origin of the striatum in light of modern patterning studies, (4) the organization of corticostriatal projections in relation to cortical types, and (5) the topography and time-course of neuron loss, glial reaction, and protein aggregation induced by neurodegenerative diseases in humans and in non-human primate models across striatal sectors and their corresponding cortical areas. We summarize current knowledge about key aspects of primate striatal anatomy and human pathology and indicate knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future studies. We aim to identify factors for selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration of striatal neurons and circuits and obtain hints that could help elucidate striatal pathology in humans.","[Lopez-Gonzalez del Rey, Natalia; Angel Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel] PhD Program Neurosci UAM Cajal, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Gonzalez del Rey, Natalia] Hosp Univ HM Puerta del Sur, HM CINAC Ctr Integral Neurociencias Abarca Campal, HM Hosp, Madrid, Spain; [Angel Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, Calle Arzobispo Morcillo 4, Madrid 28029, Spain","Autonomous University of Madrid","Garcia-Cabezas, MA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, Calle Arzobispo Morcillo 4, Madrid 28029, Spain.","garcia.cabezas@uam.es","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023","Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-0534-5182","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain [S2017/BMD-3700]; Beatriz Galindo senior research position in the School of Medicine, Universidad Autoonoma de Madrid [BEAGAL18/00098]; Madrid Government (Comunidad de Madrid-Spain); Universidad Autoonoma de Madrid","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain(Comunidad de Madrid); Beatriz Galindo senior research position in the School of Medicine, Universidad Autoonoma de Madrid; Madrid Government (Comunidad de Madrid-Spain); Universidad Autoonoma de Madrid","NL-GdR was the recipient of grant S2017/BMD-3700 (NEURO-METAB-CM) from Comunidad de Madrid, Spain.

Second, the localizations of retrogradely labelled striatopallidal neurons and of clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons (as outlined by the transport of C-14-material) were compared in cats that received four horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin injections into the internal segment of the globus pallidus and three nigral injections of C-14-amino acids into the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Two types of striatonigral neurons located predominantly within the matrix compartment were identified: poorly collateralized aggregated cells distributed in clusters and more numerous collateralized cells distributed outside the clusters. In addition, two cell types were distinguished within each cluster of aggregated neurons. Those innervating the center of the substantia nigra pars reticulata were observed after a single nigral injection of the tracer, whereas those projecting to distinct sites of the substantia nigra pars reticulata along a rostrocaudal axis were observed only after multiple injections. Striatal neurons innervating the internal segment of the globus pallidus were heterogeneously distributed predominantly within the matrix but outside the clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons. Together, these results provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of the matrix and for the complexity of matrix striatonigral connections that send both diverging and converging signals to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

In conjunction with perturbed sensory processing, migraine sufferers often present with diverse neurological manifestations (premonitory symptoms) that highlight potential brainstem involvement. Thus, as the field moves away from the view of migraine as a consequence of purely vasodilation to a greater understanding of migraine as a complex brain disorder, it is critical to consider the underlying physiology and pharmacology of key neural networks likely involved. Discussion The current review will therefore focus on the available evidence for the brainstem as a key regulator of migraine biology and associated symptoms. We will further discuss the potential role of CGRP in the brainstem and its modulation for migraine therapy, given the emergence of targeted CGRP small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies. Conclusion The brainstem forms a functional unit with several hypothalamic nuclei that are capable of modulating diverse functions including migraine-relevant trigeminal pain processing, appetite and arousal regulatory networks. As such, the brainstem has emerged as a key regulator of migraine and is appropriately considered as a potential therapeutic target. While currently available CGRP targeted therapies have limited blood brain barrier penetrability, the expression of CGRP and its receptors in several key brainstem nuclei and the demonstration of brainstem effects of CGRP modulation highlight the significant potential for the development of CNS penetrant molecules.","[Holland, Philip Robert; Saengjaroentham, Chonlawan; Vila-Pueyo, Marta] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Headache Grp, Basic & Clin Neurosci, London, England","University of London; King's College London; University College London","Holland, PR (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Basic & Clin Neurosci, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, 125 Coldharbour Lane, London SE5 9NU, England.","Philip.holland@kcl.ac.uk","Vila-Pueyo, Marta/C-8415-2018; Vila-Pueyo, Marta/M-2530-2019","Vila-Pueyo, Marta/0000-0003-0652-2988; Holland, Philip Robert/0000-0003-3345-4853","Medical Research Council [MR/P006264/1]; MRC [MR/P006264/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The work was supported by funding from the Medical Research Council (Grant / Award Number: 'MR/P006264/1').",,122,10,11,0,10,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0333-1024","1468-2982",,"CEPHALALGIA","Cephalalgia","MAR",2019,39,3,,,,,390,402,,"10.1177/0333102418756863","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0333102418756863"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0333102418756863"")",,,13,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","HN6LT",29411638,"Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000460298300007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000460298300007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Neuronal activity, where frequency of tremor appeared to oscillate independently from peripheral input, was encountered in GPi. In contrast, neuronal activity in Vim regarding frequency of firing also correlated with tremor and was passively driven by kinesthetic stimuli with a somatotopic arrangement. Pallidal lesions based on microrecording induced relative reductions of tremor, while small Vim lesions immediately alleviated tremor. Basal ganglia pathology due to dopamine depletion could generate oscillatory neuronal activity in GPi, which may cause tremor. However, peripheral feedback to the motor cortex via Vim is also significant for tremorgenesis, because Vim may be an excitatory driving source for motor cortical neurons. Thus, a Vim lesion could reduce excitability of the motor cortical neurons and abolish tremor.","Saitama Canc Ctr, Neurosurg Clin, Ina, Saitama 3620806, Japan; Neurol Clin, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan",,"Hayase, N (corresponding author), Saitama Canc Ctr, Neurosurg Clin, 818 Komuro, Ina, Saitama 3620806, Japan.",,,,,,,,33,12,13,0,1,"KARGER","BASEL","ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1011-6125",,,"STEREOT FUNCT NEUROS","Stereotact.

Our aim was to determine whether a standard comprehensive assessment of different praxic functions would demonstrate specific types of errors not attributable to bradykinesia, rigidity tremor or any other abnormal elementary motor deficit. PD patients on chronic levodopa treatment were examined in the 'on' and 'off' (treatment) states. Based on apraxia assessment scores, bilateral ideomotor apraxia for transitive movements was found in eight (75%) and 12 (27%) of PSP and PD patients, respectively. Ideomotor apraxia was mainly characterized by spatial errors (i.e. external and internal configuration body-part-as-object and trajectory). Four PSP but no PD patients exhibited ideomotor apraxia for intransitive movements. PSP as well as PD patients with ideomotor apraxia also had difficulties in imitating hand and finger postures, but none of them failed on pantomime comprehension and pantomime recognition/discrimination. Some PSP patients exhibited in addition, a limbkinetic type of apraxia and a minority of them displayed deficits on tasks involving multiple steps. Neither MSA nor NIP patients showed arty disturbance of praxic functions. There were no differences in age, disease duration, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Unified Parkinson's Disease Racing Scale and Hoehn-Yahr scores between apraxic and non-apraxic PD patients, and ideomotor apraxia scores were similar in the 'on' and 'off' states. A correlation was found between ideomotor apraxia scores in PD patients and deficits in frontal lobe-related neuropsychological tasks such as the Tower of Hanoi, verbal fluency and the Trail Making Test. Furthermore, PD patients with apraxia showed higher Hamilton depression scores than non-apraxic PD patients. In PSP patients, ideomotor apraxia scores correlated significantly with cognitive deficit as measured with MMSE. The presence or absence of cortical involvement, and its severity and distribution might determine the presence and type of apraxia in PD and PSP Apraxia in these conditions would therefore reflect combined cortico-striatal dysfunction.","INST NEUROL, UNIV DEPT CLIN NEUROL, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND; FLENI, RAUL CARREA INST NEUROL RES, BUENOS AIRES, DF, ARGENTINA; UCL NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND","University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; UCL Medical School; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust",,,"Pramstaller, Peter P/C-2357-2008; Lees, Andrew J/A-6605-2009","Lees, Andrew J/0000-0002-2476-4385",,,,,136,114,117,0,9,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0006-8950","1460-2156",,"BRAIN","Brain","JAN",1997,120,,1,,,,75,90,,"10.1093/brain/120.1.75","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/120.1.75"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/120.1.75"")",,,16,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","WJ826",9055799,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1997WJ82600007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1997WJ82600007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

It has been proposed that the striate-extrastriate and callosal projections are interdependent. In visually deprived mice, the normal patterns of callosal and striate-extrastriate projections are disrupted. It remains unknown whether visual deprivation affects the topography of V1-extrastriate projections and their relationship with callosal projections. Two anterograde tracers were injected in V1 and multiple retrograde tracer injections were performed in the contralateral hemisphere of intact and enucleated C57BL/6 mice and in ZRDCT/An mice to determine the effects of prenatal and postnatal afferent sensory activity on the topography of V1-extrastriate and callosal projections. Greater topographic anomalies were found in striate-extrastriate projections of anophthalmic than enucleated mice. In enucleated mice, the relationship between striate-extrastriate projections and callosal zones was highly variable. In anophthalmic mice, there was also a greater overlap between these projections. These results suggest that the prenatal afferent sensory activity regulates some aspects of the distribution of V1-extrastriate and callosal projections, in addition to the development of a normal topographic representation in extrastriate areas.","[Laramee, Marie-Eve; Bronchti, Gilles; Boire, Denis] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Neurosci, Dept Anat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Boire, Denis] Univ Montreal, Ecole Optometrie, Montreal, PQ H3T 1P1, Canada","University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; Universite de Montreal","Boire, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Neurosci, Dept Anat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada.","denis.boire@uqtr.ca","Boire, Denis/I-4530-2019","Boire, Denis/0000-0001-5614-4976; Laramee, Marie-Eve/0000-0003-0896-6224","National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI Leader) grant; Alexander Graham Bell (NSERC) fellowship; NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award; Reseau de la Recherche en Sante de la Vision (FRQS-Quebec)","National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI Leader) grant; Alexander Graham Bell (NSERC) fellowship; NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Reseau de la Recherche en Sante de la Vision (FRQS-Quebec)","This work was supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grants and institutional support from UQTR to DB and GB and by a Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI Leader) grant to DB.

A structural model relates connections to laminar differences between linked areas. The model is based on the principle of systematic structural variation in the cortex, extending from the simplest limbic cortices to eulaminate areas with elaborate lamination. The model accounts for laminar patterns and for the strength and topography of connections between nearby or distant cortices and subcortical structures, exemplified quantitatively for the principal and special prefrontal connections. Widespread connections of limbic areas and focal connections of eulaminate areas yield a broad range of circuit patterns for diverse functions. These diverse pathways innervate excitatory and functionally distinct inhibitory neurons, providing the basis for differential recruitment of areas for flexible behavior. Systematic structural variation likely emerges by timing differences in the development of distinct areas and has important implications for altered connections in diseases of developmental origin.","Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Neural Syst Lab,Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Neural Syst Lab,Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","barbas@bu.edu",,"Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832","National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01NS024760]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH057414]; National Science Foundation [BNS 8315411]; National Science Foundation [Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST) NSF] [SBE-0354378]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation [Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST) NSF]","I thank Drs.

To investigate this question, we developed a trait-like measure of risk propensity which we correlated with resting-state functional connectivity to identify sex differences. Specifically, we used short- and long-range functional connectivity densities to identify associated brain regions and examined their functional connectivities in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from a large sample of healthy young volunteers. We found that men had a higher level of general risk propensity (GRP) than women. At the neural level, although they shared a common neural correlate of GRP in a network centered at the right inferior frontal gyrus, men and women differed in a network centered at the right secondary somatosensory cortex, which included the bilateral dorsal anterior/middle insular cortices and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, men and women differed in a local network centered at the left inferior orbitofrontal cortex. Most of the regions identified by this resting-state fMRI study have been previously implicated in risk processing when people make risky decisions. This study provides a new perspective on the brain-behavioral relationships in risky decision making and contributes to our understanding of sex differences in risk propensity.","[Zhou, Yuan; Li, Shu; Rao, Li-Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Dunn, John] Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Li, Huandong; Zhu, Maohu; Song, Ming; Jiang, Tianzi] Chinese Acad Sci, Brainnetome Ctr, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Huandong; Zhu, Maohu; Song, Ming; Jiang, Tianzi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Qin, Wen; Yu, Chunshui] Tianjin Med Univ, Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tianzi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tianzi] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Psychology, CAS; University of Adelaide; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Tianjin Medical University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Queensland","Yu, CS (corresponding author), Tianjin Med Univ, Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, 154 Anshan Road, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China.","chunshuiyu@yahoo.cn; jiangtz@nlpr.ia.ac.cn","QIN, WEN/F-3783-2015; Jiang, Tianzi/I-4256-2012; Zhou, Yuan/AAI-6570-2021; Zhou, Yuan/N-5569-2017; Li, Shu-Chen/K-7838-2012","QIN, WEN/0000-0002-9121-8296; Jiang, Tianzi/0000-0001-9531-291X; Zhou, Yuan/0000-0001-6378-1711; Zhou, Yuan/0000-0001-6378-1711; Li, Shu-Chen/0000-0002-5520-5789; li, shu/0000-0003-4402-1674; Dunn, John/0000-0002-3950-3460; Yu, Chunshui/0000-0001-5648-5199","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2011CB707800, 2011CB711000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30900487, 31170976, 91132301]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists; Project for Young Scientists Fund of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y0CX163S01]","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists; Project for Young Scientists Fund of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This research was partially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, Nos. 2011CB707800 and 2011CB711000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 30900487, 31170976 and 91132301), Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Professorship for Senior International Scientists and Project for Young Scientists Fund of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y0CX163S01).

Several controls were performed for the separation of memory effects from other factors such as attention, stimulus attributes and eye movements. One of the controls employed a standardised sequence of events ('window trial') during which a window in a black screen was opened and a face, an object or a picture was presented. Unit cell activity was recorded from 209 sites in the posterior parietal cortex (area PG) and 186 sites in the pulvinar. Some units responded during the presentation of the DMS stimuli, mostly those in that part of area PG located in the superior temporal sulcus. They often appeared to be related to the task-related state of attention. There was no indication of pure memory-related changes in activity such as sustained responses during the inter-stimulus interval or specific responses to the second stimulus that would indicate a dependence on the kind of the preceding stimulus. In the window trial, some parietal units, mostly in that part of area PG located in the intraparietal sulcus (a region termed area LIP), responded in a relatively specific manner during and sometimes even after, the presentation of a human face. The responses often seemed to be related to the animal's state of attention. Almost no pulvinar unit responded in this paradigm. It is concluded that area PG and, to a lesser extent, the pulvinar are involved in the modulation of attention in relation to behaviourally relevant changes in the environment. If these structures have a role in memory function, it must be secondary to a role in controlling or regulating attention.","MAX PLANCK INST BIOPHYS CHEM,DEPT NEUROBIOL,W-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY","Max Planck Society",,,,,,,,,62,14,14,0,2,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0166-4328",,,"BEHAV BRAIN RES","Behav.

Thus, besides olfactory dysfunctions, it is conceivable that the compromise of these structures can lead to cognitive impairment. The olfactory bulb is affected by alpha-synuclein pathology in almost all cases of both Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The clinical distinction between these disorders relies on the timing in the appearance of dementia in relationship to motor symptoms. Typically, it occurs late in the course of Parkinson's disease, and within the first year in dementia with Lewy bodies. The close anatomical proximity of the olfactory bulb with limbic regions, together with the early occurrence of cognitive impairment that is observed in dementia with Lewy bodies, raise the question whether the propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology in this condition might originate in the olfactory bulb, spreading from there to other limbic structures, and thereby reaching the associative neocortex. This review will describe the anatomical basis of the olfactory system and discuss the evidence of potential spreading pathways from the olfactory bulb that could support the presence of early dementia in the setting of Lewy body disorders.","[Graciela Cersosimo, Maria] Univ Buenos Aires, Hosp Clin, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Unit, Cordoba 2351,Piso 9,Sala 1 C1120AAR, Caba, Buenos Aires, Argentina","University of Buenos Aires","Cersosimo, MG (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Hosp Clin, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Unit, Cordoba 2351,Piso 9,Sala 1 C1120AAR, Caba, Buenos Aires, Argentina.","mgcersosimo@gmail.com",,,,,,,88,29,31,0,7,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0302-766X","1432-0878",,"CELL TISSUE RES","Cell Tissue Res.","JUL",2018,373,1,,,"SI",,233,243,,"10.1007/s00441-017-2733-6","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-017-2733-6"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-017-2733-6"")",,,11,"Cell Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Cell Biology","GK4DR",29196808,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000436106100018","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000436106100018"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Among 187 recorded units, very few exhibited any evidence of place-specific firing on any of the behavioral tasks, except to the extent that different spatial locations were related to distinct phases of the task. Furthermore, no prefrontal unit showed unambiguous spatially dependent delay activity that might mediate working memory for spatial locations. Rather, the cells exhibited diverse correlates that were generally associated with the behavioral requirements of performing the task. This included firing related to intertrial intervals, onset or end of trials, selection of specific arms on the eight-arm radial maze, delay periods, approach to or departure from goals, and selection of paths on the figure-eight track. Although a small number of cells showed similar behavioral correlates across tasks, the majority of cells showed no consistent correlate when recorded across multiple tasks. Furthermore, some units did not exhibit altered firing patterns in any of the three tasks, while others showed changes in firing that were not consistently related to specific behaviors or task components. These results are in agreement with previous lesion and behavioral studies in rats that suggest a prefrontal cortical role in encoding 'rules' (i.e. structural features) or behavioral sequences within a task but not in encoding allocentric spatial information. Given that the hippocampal projection to this cortical region is capable of undergoing LTP, our data lead to the hypothesis that the role of this projection is not to impose spatial representations upon prefrontal activity, but to provide a mechanism for learning the spatial context in which particular behaviors are appropriate.","Univ Arizona, Arizona Res Labs, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Physiol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Ajou Univ, Inst Med Sci, Neurosci Lab, Suwon 442749, South Korea; Ajou Univ, Dept Physiol, Suwon 442749, South Korea","University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Ajou University; Ajou University","McNaughton, BL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Arizona Res Labs, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Life Sci N Bldg,Rm 384, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.","bruce@nsma.arizona.edu","Jung, Min Whan/GXF-5216-2022",,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH01227] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS20331] Funding Source: Medline","NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,63,243,245,1,10,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

We analyzed a series of 20 fetal and two adult human brains using Nissl stain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, and immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein (MBP), neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), a pan-axonal neurofilament marker, and synaptophysin, as well as postmortem 3T MRI. In comparison with other parts of the cerebral cortex, the cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC begins remarkably early, in the 10th week of gestation (w.g.). The differentiation occurs in a superficial magnocellular layer in the deep part of the marginal zone, accompanied by cortical plate (CP) condensation and multilayering of the deep part of CP. These processes last until the 13-14th w.g. At 14 w.g., the superficial lamina dissecans (LD) is visible, which divides the CP into the lamina principalis externa (LPE) and interna (LPI). Simultaneously, the rostral LPE separates into vertical cell-dense islands, whereas in the LPI, the deep LD emerges as a clear acellular layer. In the 16th w.g., the LPE remodels into vertical cell-dense and cell-sparse zones with a caudorostral gradient. At 20 w.g., NeuN immunoreactivity is most pronounced in the islands of layer II cells, whereas migration and differentiation inside-out gradients are seen simultaneously in both the upper (LPE) and the lower (LPI) pyramidal layers. At this stage, the EC adopts for the first time an adult-like cytoarchitectural organization, the superficial LD becomes discernible by 3T MRI, MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes first appear in the fimbria and the perforant path (PP) penetrates the subiculum to reach its molecular layer and travels along through the Cornu Ammonis fields to reach the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus, whereas the entorhinal-dentate branch perforates the hippocampal sulcus about 2-3 weeks later. The first AChE reactivity appears as longitudinal stripes at 23 w.g. in layers I and II of the rostrolateral EC and then also as AChE-positive in-growing fibers in islands of superficial layer III and layer II neurons. At 40 w.g., myelination of the PP starts as patchy MBP-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes and their processes. Our results refute the possibility of an inside-out pattern of the EC development and support the key role of layer II prospective stellate cells in the EC lamination. As the early cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC is paralleled by the neurochemical development, these developmental milestones in EC structure and connectivity have implications for understanding its normal function, including its puzzling modular organization and potential contribution to consciousness content (awareness), as well as for its insufficiently explored deficits in developmental, psychiatric, and degenerative brain disorders.","[Simic, Goran; Krsnik, Zeljka; Knezovic, Vinka; Junakovic, Alisa; Rados, Milan; Spanic, Ena; Vuksic, Mario; Kostovic, Ivica] Univ Zagreb Med Sch, Croatian Inst Brain Res, Dept Neurosci, Salata 12, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia; [Kelovic, Zlatko] Univ Zagreb Med Sch, Dept Anat, Zagreb, Croatia; [Mathiasen, Mathias Lysholt; Hall, Vanessa Jane] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Vet & Anim Sci, Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Mulc, Damir] Univ Zagreb Med Sch, Psychiat Hosp Vrapce, Zagreb, Croatia; [Quattrocolo, Giulia; Witter, Menno P.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Kavli Inst Syst Neurosci, Trondheim, Norway; [Quattrocolo, Giulia; Witter, Menno P.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Neural Computat, Trondheim, Norway; [Zaborszky, Laszlo] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ USA; [Bordonau, Francisco Olucha] Univ Jaume 1, Sch Med Sci, Dept Med, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Hof, Patrick R.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Nash Family Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Hof, Patrick R.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA","University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb; University of Copenhagen; University of Zagreb; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Rutgers State University Newark; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Universitat Jaume I; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","Simic, G (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb Med Sch, Croatian Inst Brain Res, Dept Neurosci, Salata 12, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.","gsimic@hiim.hr","Krsnik, Zeljka/AAI-2999-2020; Šimić, Goran/A-9262-2013; Lysholt Mathiasen, Mathias/GPS-8728-2022","Krsnik, Zeljka/0000-0001-5238-6820; Šimić, Goran/0000-0002-6339-9261; Quattrocolo, Giulia/0000-0001-6508-8910; Mulc, Damir/0000-0002-4021-5378; Hall, Vanessa/0000-0002-3598-2214; Knezovic, Vinka/0000-0003-0978-5644","Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2019-04-3584]; Scientific Centre of Excellence for Basic, Clinical, and Translational Neuroscience CoRE-NEURO - European Union through the European Regional Development Fund [GA KK01.1.1.01.0007]","Croatian Science Foundation; Scientific Centre of Excellence for Basic, Clinical, and Translational Neuroscience CoRE-NEURO - European Union through the European Regional Development Fund","This work is the result of the efforts of many colleagues who have been involved in the collection, processing, analysis, storage, and digitization of the postmortal human brain material in the Zagreb Neuroembryological Collection over the past 50 years.

Recently, we found that the cortical and perceptual changes induced by repetitive somatosensory stimulation (RSS) at a finger transfer to the face. However, whether such cross-border changes are specific to the face remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether RSS-induced acuity changes at the finger can also transfer to the forearm, which is the body part represented on the other side of the hand representation. Our results confirmed the transfer of tactile learning from the stimulated finger to the lip, but no significant changes were observed at the forearm. A second experiment revealed that the same regions on the forearm exhibited improved tactile acuity when RSS was applied there, excluding the possibility of low plastic ability at the arm representation. This provides also the first evidence that RSS can be efficient on body parts other than the hand. These results suggest that RSS-induced tactile learning transfers preferentially from the hand to the face rather than to the forearm. This specificity could arise from a stronger functional connectivity between the cortical hand and face representations, reflecting a fundamental coupling between these body parts.","[Muret, Dollyane; Dinse, Hubert R.] Ruhr Univ, Inst Neuroinformat, Neural Plast Lab, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Muret, Dollyane; Dinse, Hubert R.] BG Univ, Hosp Bergmannsheil, Dept Neurol, D-44789 Bochum, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum","Muret, D (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ, Inst Neuroinformat, Neural Plast Lab, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.;Muret, D (corresponding author), BG Univ, Hosp Bergmannsheil, Dept Neurol, D-44789 Bochum, Germany.","dollyane.muret@gmail.com","Muret, Dollyane/AAV-5084-2021","Muret, Dollyane/0000-0002-2626-654X; dinse, hubert/0000-0001-9024-0451","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DI 334/20-1]","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DI 334/20-1).",,50,5,5,2,4,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322",,,"SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","AUG 6",2018,8,,,,,,,,11752,"10.1038/s41598-018-30183-5","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30183-5"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30183-5"")",,,8,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","GP3VG",30082760,"Green Published, gold",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000440782000039","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000440782000039"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

To this end, three rhesus monkeys were rendered hemiparkinsonian by intracarotid injections of MPTP. The animals then received intra-SNr injections of the GABA, receptor agonist muscimol to inactivate small portions of the SNr, Before and after these injections, parkinsonian motor signs were evaluated with a battery of behavioral observation methods. Injections into the centrolateral SNr reduced contralateral limb akinesia and bradykinesia in two animals. By contrast, medial injections induced generalized activation, contralateral turning, and saccadic eye movements in all animals. Injections in the most lateral and posterior portions of the nucleus had no effects. Two of the animals also received ibotenic acid lesions of the SNr, followed by a series of similar observations.

The comparative approach, comparing geniculocortical terminations and cortical connections across several areas, has suggested both specific structural-functional correlations (for example, in extrastriate area MT/V5) and more subtle, possibly gradient-wise variations. Likely future directions for this line of research include more direct correlations of axon geometry with functional architectures, investigations of microcircuitry at the level of electron or confocal microscopy, anatomical and functional investigations of connectional convergence and interactions, and, not least, a more comprehensive database.

Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.","Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10012 USA","Universite de Montreal; New York University","Thivierge, JP (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, CP 6128 Succ,Centerville, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.","jean-philippe.thivierge@umontreal.ca",,,,,,,68,101,102,0,18,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON","LONDON","84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND","0166-2236",,,"TRENDS NEUROSCI","Trends Neurosci.","JUN",2007,30,6,,,,,251,259,,"10.1016/j.tins.2007.04.004","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2007.04.004"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2007.04.004"")",,,9,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","179GN",17462748,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000247277800001","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000247277800001"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Moving-bar visual stimuli of different extension, stimuli moving in different directions, the impact of non-specific cortical activation upon synchronous oscillation, and the frequency content of EEG associated with synchrony were considered. The magnitude of zero lag synchrony was primarily accounted for by the properties of the eigenmodes of the travelling local field potential superposition waves generated by inputs to the cortex, largely independent of the oscillation properties and associated spectral content. Approximation of the differences in cross-correlation observed with differently moving bar stimuli, and of the impact of cortical activation, required added assumptions on (a) spatial coherence of efferent volleys al-ising from parts of a single stimulus object and (b) the presence of low-amplitude diffuse held noise, with enhancement of cortical signal/noise ratio with respect to the spatially coherent inputs, at higher levels of cortical activation. Synchrony appears to be a ubiquitous property of cortex-like delay networks. Precision in the modelling of synchronous oscillation findings will require detailed description of input pathways, cortical connectivity, cortical stability, and aspects of cortical/subcortical interactions.","Mental Hlth Res Inst Victoria, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",,"Wright, JJ (corresponding author), Mental Hlth Res Inst Victoria, 155 Oak St, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",,,"Chapman, Clare/0000-0002-1306-5415; Bourke, Paul/0000-0002-0325-882X",,,,,45,29,30,0,6,"SPRINGER-VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0340-1200",,,"BIOL CYBERN","Biol.

The metabolic mapping revealed activation of sensorimotor cortex only in the hemisphere contralateral to the moving forelimb, irrespective of whether this hemisphere was intact or visually deafferented. These results suggest that visually guided reaching with the forelimb contralateral to the ''blind'' hemisphere is sub-served by that hemisphere's sensorimotor cortex and not by the cortex of the ipsilateral, ''seeing'' hemisphere.

It is suggested that the ''blind'' hemisphere utilizes at least two distinct pieces of information to guide forelimb movements to visual targets: (1) information about the location of the visual target derived from head and eye movements made to this target and mediated via the inferior parietal cortical areas 7a and 7-ip, and (2) information about the instantaneous upper extremity position derived from forelimb proprioceptive mechanisms and mediated via the somatosensory cortex and thereafter via the superior parietal cortical area, lateral 5-ip.","NIMH,NEUROPSYCHOL LAB,BETHESDA,MD 20892; NIMH,CEREBRAL METAB LAB,BETHESDA,MD 20892","National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)","SAVAKI, HE (corresponding author), UNIV CRETE,SCH HLTH SCI,DEPT BASIC SCI,DIV MED,PHYSIOL LAB,GR-71110 IRAKLION,GREECE.",,,,,,,,80,54,54,0,1,"SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036","0270-6474",,,"J NEUROSCI","J.

Full definition of these areas will require a combination of functional and histological methods but, by using six complementary histological methods, of which most have been used in the monkey, we provide a clearer description of these areas. The primary auditory area was located on the posteromedial two-thirds of the first transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyrus and was distinguished by a dense band of cytochrome oxidase activity in layer IV and the base of layer III, as well as a relatively thick, pale layer V and VI. Layers V and VI together made up 40% of the cortical thickness. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing pyramidal cells were sparsely distributed within the primary auditory area. The anterolateral third of Heschl's gyrus did not have a clear band of high cytochrome oxidase activity but contained a moderately high density of AChE-containing pyramidal cells and thus appeared to be part of the auditory belt. Within Heschl's sulcus there was a third area, which had a band of high cytochrome oxidase activity and bands of high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and AChE activity in layer IV. This area appeared to be part of the auditory core. Thus the use of staining methods for cytochrome oxidase, AChE and parvalbumin provided additional information which allowed a clearer definition of auditory areas than Nissl or myelin staining alone. Our results suggest that there are two core areas surrounded by at least six belt areas in the human auditory region.","Univ Aberdeen, Marischal Coll, Dept Biomed Sci, Aberdeen AB9 1AS, Scotland; MRC, Inst Hearing Res, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","University of Aberdeen","Wallace, MN (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Marischal Coll, Dept Biomed Sci, Aberdeen AB9 1AS, Scotland.",,"Wallace, Mark/ABC-1573-2020","Wallace, Mark/0000-0001-6894-4903; Palmer, Alan/0000-0001-5893-4525",,,,,40,127,128,0,2,"SPRINGER-VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

This study investigates the potential roles of feedback interactions in neural information processing. We consider a two-layer continuous attractor neural network (CANN), in which neurons in the first layer receive feedback inputs from those in the second one. By utilizing the intrinsic property of a CANN, we use a projection method to reduce the dimensionality of the network dynamics significantly. The simplified dynamics allows us to elucidate the effects of feedback modulation analytically. We find that positive feedback enhances the stability of the network state, leading to an improved population decoding performance, whereas negative feedback increases the mobility of the network state, inducing spontaneously moving bumps. For strong, negative feedback interaction, the network response to a moving stimulus can lead the actual stimulus position, achieving an anticipative behavior. The biological implications of these findings are discussed.

One of these circuits, the motor circuit, is critically involved in the development of parkinsonian motor signs. Current pathophysiologic models postulate that parkinsonism is associated with increased activity in the basal ganglia output nuclei. The neuronal activity in the motor portion of one of these output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), has been characterized in detail in intact and parkinsonian animals, but the neuronal activity in the second major basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), has received far less attention. This study in primates represents a comparison of the effects of parkinsonism, induced by injections of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), on the neuronal discharge in the GPi and SNr. These electrophysiologic recording experiments were carried out in three African green and two rhesus monkeys. One hundred and twenty-four neurons were recorded in the GPi before treatment with MPTP, and 93 neurons thereafter. In the SNr, 55 cells were recorded before treatment with MPTP, and 41 cells thereafter. MPTP induced a non-significant increase in the average discharge rate and a significant decrease in the median interspike interval length (ISI) in the GPi (by 13%), whereas no changes were detected in either parameter in the SNr. The average ISI distributions were markedly asymmetric in both structures, and could be modeled by a logarithmic normal distribution. With the MPTP treatment, the mode of the ISI distribution fell by 24% in the GPi (P less than or equal to 0.01), whereas it did not change significantly in the SNr. An algorithm that detects burst discharges in the raw ISI data (based on the method by Legendy and Salcman) detected a significant increase in the proportion of action potentials that participated in bursts of discharge in both structures (increase by 257% in the GPi, and by 67% in the SNr). Power spectral and autocorrelation analysis revealed that treatment with MPTP increased the proportion of cells with oscillatory burst patterns at 3-8 Hz in both structures (from 0.8% to 27% of all neurons in the GPi, and from none to 10% in the SNr). The results show that neuronal discharge in the SNr is affected in parkinsonism, but that the changes in the SNr are less pronounced then those seen in the GPi.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, Dept Physiol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel","Emory University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Wichmann, T (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Suite 6000,Woodruff Mem Res Bldg,1639 Pierce Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.","twichma@emory.edu",,"Subramanian, Thyagarajan/0000-0001-5930-017X","NINDS NIH HHS [5-R01-NS15417-14] Funding Source: Medline","NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))",,,88,241,247,0,16,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Here we tested, in rats, the hypothesis that BLA is critical for conditioned reinforcer devaluation during the period when the primary reinforcer (food) is being devalued (by feeding it to satiety), but not thereafter for guiding behavioral choices. We used a spatially independent task that used two visual cues, each predicting one of two foods. An instrumental action (lever press) was required for reinforcer delivery. After training, rats received BLA or sham lesions, or cannulae implanted in BLA. Under control conditions (sham lesions, saline infusions), devaluation of one food significantly decreased responding to the cue associated with that food, when both cues were presented simultaneously during extinction. BLA lesions impaired this devaluation effect. Transient inactivation of BLA by microinfusion of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A agonist muscimol resulted in an impairment only when BLA was inactivated during satiation. When muscimol was infused after satiation and therefore, BLA was inactivated only during the choice test, rats showed no impairment. Thus, BLA is necessary for registering or updating cues to reflect updated reinforcer values, but not for guiding choices once the value has been updated. Our results are the first to describe the contribution of rat BLA to specific components of reinforcer devaluation and are the first to show impairment in reinforcer devaluation following transient inactivation in the rat.","[West, Elizabeth A.; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Murnen, Alice T.; McCue, David L.; Gale, Karen; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [West, Elizabeth A.; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Gale, Karen; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Interdisciplinary Program Neurosci, Washington, DC 20007 USA","Georgetown University; Georgetown University","Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, 3900 Reservoir Rd NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.","malkoval@georgetown.edu","West, Elizabeth/AIE-9970-2022; Forcelli, Patrick A/G-6970-2012","Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X; West, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2013-5995","National Institute on Drug Abuse [F31DA026705, T32DA007291]; National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke [F31NS066822, T32NS04123]; Epilepsy Foundation Fellowship [EFA123098]; Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; Georgetown University Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Program; Department of Pharmacology Physiology","National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Epilepsy Foundation Fellowship; Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; Georgetown University Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Program; Department of Pharmacology Physiology","The work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Grants F31DA026705 (Elizabeth A.

Using simulations of cerebral cortex and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we show patterns of zero-lag synchronisation (associated with empirically realistic spectral content) can arise from both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. For low levels of activation, we show the synchronous field is described by the eigenmodes of the resultant damped wave activity. The first and second spatial eigenmodes (which capture most of the signal variance) arise from the even and odd components of the independent input signals. The pattern of zero-lag synchronisation can be accounted for by the relative dominance of the first mode over the second, in the near-field of the inputs. The simulated cortical surface can act as a few millisecond response coincidence detector for concurrent, but uncorrelated, inputs. As cortical activation levels are increased, local damped oscillations in the gamma band undergo a transition to highly nonlinear undamped activity with 40 Hz dominant frequency. This is associated with locking between active sites and spatially segregated phase patterns. The damped wave synchronisation and the locked nonlinear oscillations may combine to permit fast representation of multiple patterns of activity within the same field of neurons.","Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Auckland, Sch Med, Liggins Inst, Auckland, New Zealand; Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Comp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia","University of Sydney; University of Auckland; Swinburne University of Technology","Chapman, CL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,"Chapman, Clare/0000-0002-1306-5415; Bourke, Paul/0000-0002-0325-882X",,,,,68,27,29,0,1,"SPRINGER-VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0303-6812",,,"J MATH BIOL","J.

Subjects were three males and three females who were candidates for neurosurgical treatments of partial epilepsy. Subdural electrodes were attached to the medial and basal temporal lobe cortices, allowing ECoG and electroencephalogram from the scalp vertex (Cz EEG) to be recorded simultaneously during all night sleep. In one case, subdural electrodes were attached also on the parietal lobe. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analyses were performed on the ECoG and Cz EEG signals. No organized sleep spindles or sigma band (12-16 Hz) peaks in FFT power spectra were observed from the medial or basal temporal lobes of the non-epileptogenic hemispheres during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In a case with parietal electrodes, organized spindle bursts were observed in parietal signals synchronized with Cz spindles. Although delta band (0.3-3 Hz) power from both the medial and basal temporal lobes fluctuated across each night as expected, sigma activity changed little. However, 14 Hz oscillatory bursts were observed in the medial basal temporal lobe of epileptogenic hemisphere in two cases and bilaterally in one case during not only NREM sleep but rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness. From the present study we conclude that sleep spindle activities are absent in the medial and basal temporal lobes. Fourteen Hz oscillatory bursts observed from the medial or basal temporal lobe in some cases were not considered to be sleep spindles since they also appeared during REM sleep and wakefulness. These waveforms could have originated due to epileptic pathology, since they frequently appeared in epileptic regions.","Tokyo Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychophysiol, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568585, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Neuropsychiat, Tokyo, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Neurol Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Tokyo, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience","Uchida, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychophysiol, Setagaya Ku, 2-1-8 Kamikitazawa, Tokyo 1568585, Japan.",,,,,,,,38,23,23,0,1,"BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA","CARLTON","54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA","1323-1316",,,"PSYCHIAT CLIN NEUROS","Psychiatry Clin.

The movements evoked by the NL mainly concerned forelimb and head segments. Only in a few cases were movements of hindlimb segments evoked. Motor effects were obtained according to a precise topographical pattern. This pattern delimited functional zones, or representations, within the NL, each zone being specifically related to a particular segment of the body. A few body segments were activated from single zones only (single representation) whereas some other body segments could be activated from different zones of the NL. Among them, the axio-proximal body segments were activated in a similar way from all sites (multiple representation) whereas the distal body segments were differently activated from the various representation zones (specific representation). The multiple and specific representations were distributed between the 3 cytoarchitectonic subregions of the NL (NLm, DLH and slp) in such a way that the body segments were usually represented only once in each individual NL subregion. Each NL subregion included sets of representations concerning body segments characterized by a topographical continuity (e.g. the different segments of the forelimb in both DLH and slp). Thus, the individual NL subregions may bring into play coordinate plurisegmental muscular activities of the limbs and/or of the head. The NLm controls movements of all the segments of the head and those of axio-proximal segments of both limbs. The DLH particularly controls movements of the head, including both the proximal (neck) and the oral regions. To a lesser degree, DLH controls movements of the various segments of the forelimb, including synchronous flexion of all the digits. The slp is specifically involved in the control of motor activities of: i) the proximal segment of the head (rotation of the neck) as well as its distal segments (displacement of individual vibrissae, rotation of the ear pinna) and ii) the various segments of the forelimb including individual digits. Functionally, the proximal segments would be concerned in the spatial displacement of the limbs or of the head whereas the distal segments would be involved in the realization of precise and discrete movements related to specific functions of the distal segments concerned. The 3 subregions of the NL may be concerned in different motor functions. The results suggest the involvement of: i) the NLm in the postural adjustments of the body, or of part of it; ii) the DLH in motor behaviours which integrate the oral and the forelimb motor activities; iii) the slp in exploratory activities (by moving individual vibrissae, the ear pinna and individual digits) and/or in discrete manipulative activities.","INSERM, U106, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)","CICIRATA, F (corresponding author), IST FISIOL UMANA, VIALE A DORIA 6, I-95125 CATANIA, ITALY.",,,"SERAPIDE, MARIA FRANCESCA/0000-0001-6332-4772",,,,,32,28,28,0,3,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

It is believed that anatomical connectivity can be used to probe hierarchical organization, however direct characterization of this principle in-vivo within humans remains elusive. Here, we use resting-state functional connectivity as a complement to anatomical connectivity to investigate topographical principles of human S1. We employ a novel approach to examine mesoscopic variations of functional connectivity, and demonstrate a topographic organisation spanning the region's hierarchical axis that strongly correlates with underlying microstructure while tracing along architectonic Brodmann areas. Our findings characterize anatomical hierarchy of S1 as a 'continuous spectrum' with evidence supporting a functional boundary between areas 3b and 1. The identification of this topography bridges the gap between structure and connectivity, and may be used to help further current understanding of sensorimotor deficits.","[Ngo, Geoffrey N.; Menon, Ravi S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Med Biophys, London, ON, Canada; [Haak, Koen, V; Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Ctr Integrat Neuroimaging WIN FMRIB, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Menon, Ravi S.] Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Funct & Metab Mapping, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario); Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Oxford; Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Menon, RS (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Funct & Metab Mapping, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada.","rmenon@robarts.ca","Haak, Koen/AAM-5500-2020; Menon, Ravi/GQY-7621-2022; Beckmann, Christian F./E-6374-2012; Haak, Koen V/G-6417-2018; Menon, Ravi S/K-5500-2013","Haak, Koen/0000-0001-9309-1906; Menon, Ravi/0000-0002-7916-0263; Beckmann, Christian F./0000-0002-3373-3193; Haak, Koen V/0000-0001-9309-1906; Menon, Ravi S/0000-0002-7916-0263","CIHR Foundation Scheme grant [FDN 148453]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWOVeni 016.171.068, NWOVidi 864.12.003]; Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award [215573/Z/19/Z]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Gravitation Programme Language in Interaction [024.001.006]; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers [1U54MH091657]","CIHR Foundation Scheme grant(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award(Wellcome Trust); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Gravitation Programme Language in Interaction; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Clinical Center (CC))","This work was supported by CIHR Foundation Scheme grant FDN 148453 (R.S.M.) , Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWOVeni 016.171.068 to K.V.H. and NWOVidi 864.12.003 to C.F.B.) and the Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award [215573/Z/19/Z] .

These differences indicate a different circuit design for mouse V1 than that of cat or monkey. Here we develop a large-scale computational model of an effective input layer of mouse V1. Constrained by experiment data, the model successfully reproduces experimentally observed response properties-for example, distributions of firing rates, orientation tuning widths, and response modulations of simple and complex neurons, including the contrast dependence of orientation tuning curves. Analysis of the model shows that strong feedback inhibition and strong orientation-preferential cortical excitation to the excitatory population are the predominant mechanisms underlying the contrast-sharpening of OS in excitatory neurons, while the contrast-broadening of OS in inhibitory neurons results from a strong but nonpreferential cortical excitation to these inhibitory neurons, with the resulting contrast-broadened inhibition producing a secondary enhancement on the contrast-sharpened OS of excitatory neurons. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we show that adjusting the detailed balances between the predominant mechanisms can lead to contrast invariance-providing insights for future studies on contrast dependence (invariance).","[Dai, Wei P.] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Phys & Astron, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Dai, Wei P.; Zhou, Douglas; Cai, David] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Douglas; Cai, David] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Douglas; Cai, David] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab Sci & Engn Comp, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [McLaughlin, David W.; Cai, David] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [McLaughlin, David W.; Cai, David] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [McLaughlin, David W.; Cai, David] New York Univ Shanghai, Shanghai 200122, Peoples R China; [McLaughlin, David W.] NYU, NYU Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [McLaughlin, David W.] NYU, Neurosci Inst, NYU Langone Hlth, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Cai, David] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, NYUAD Inst, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; New York University; New York University; NYU Shanghai; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York University; NYU Langone Medical Center","Zhou, D (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Zhou, D (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Zhou, D (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab Sci & Engn Comp, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;McLaughlin, DW (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.;McLaughlin, DW (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.;McLaughlin, DW (corresponding author), New York Univ Shanghai, Shanghai 200122, Peoples R China.;McLaughlin, DW (corresponding author), NYU, NYU Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.;McLaughlin, DW (corresponding author), NYU, Neurosci Inst, NYU Langone Hlth, New York, NY 10016 USA.","zdz@sjtu.edu.cn; david.mclaughlin@nyu.edu","Zhou, Douglas/E-5428-2019","Zhou, Douglas/0000-0001-6631-2961","National Science Foundation in China [11671259, 11722107, 91630208, 31571071]; NYU Abu Dhabi Institute [G1301]","National Science Foundation in China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NYU Abu Dhabi Institute","We thank Louis Tao for initial discussions of this work, and the two referees for their helpful reviews.

Pathological changes in white matter are evident in adults with autism, particularly affecting axons below the anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). It is still unknown whether axon pathology appears early or late in development and whether it changes or not from childhood through adulthood. To address these questions, we examined typical and pathological development of about 1 million axons in post-mortem brains of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism (ages 3-67years). We used high-resolution microscopy to systematically sample and study quantitatively the fine structure of myelinated axons in the white matter below ACC. We provide novel evidence of changes in the density, size and trajectories of ACC axons in typical postnatal development from childhood through adulthood. Against the normal profile of axon development, our data revealed lower density of myelinated axons that connect ACC with neighboring cortices in children with autism. In the course of development the proportion of thin axons, which form short-range pathways, increased significantly in individuals with autism, but remained flat in controls. In contrast, the relative proportion of thick axons, which form long-range pathways, increased from childhood to adulthood in the control group, but decreased in autism. Our findings provide a timeline for profound changes in axon density and thickness below ACC that affect axon physiology in a direction suggesting bias in short over distant neural communication in autism. Importantly, measures of axon density, myelination, and orientation provide white matter anisotropy/diffusivity estimates at the level of single axons. The structural template established can be used to compare with measures obtained from imaging in living subjects, and guide analysis of functional and structural imaging data from humans for comparison with pathological states.","[Zikopoulos, Basilis; Liu, Xuefeng; Tepe, Justin; Trutzer, Iris] Boston Univ, Human Syst Neurosci Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 401D, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zikopoulos, Basilis; Trutzer, Iris; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [John, Yohan J.; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University; Boston University","Zikopoulos, B (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Human Syst Neurosci Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 401D, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Zikopoulos, B (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","zikopoul@bu.edu","Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012; John, Yohan/AAJ-2514-2020","Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104","NIMH [R01MH101209]; Autism Speaks [2156]","NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Autism Speaks","Supported by grants from NIMH (R01MH101209) and Autism Speaks (#2156) received by BZ.",,86,16,17,1,3,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0001-6322","1432-0533",,"ACTA NEUROPATHOL","Acta Neuropathol.","NOV",2018,136,5,,,,,759,778,,"10.1007/s00401-018-1904-1","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00401-018-1904-1"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00401-018-1904-1"")",,,20,"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Pathology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Pathology","HB0RG",30191402,"Green Published, hybrid",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000450724300007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000450724300007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Here, we examined the relationship between the heterogeneity of neuronal responses and population coding.

We examined the effects of extrinsic (i.e., distance) and intrinsic (i.e., size) properties of the second target on the various kinematic phases of reaching-grasping. We randomly varied distance and size of both stimuli across the experimental session. The kinematics of the reach initial phase of both patients and controls was influenced by the distance of both the first and the second target. In particular, peak acceleration increased far farther position of the second target. However, in the subsequent phase, patients, differently from controls, modified their reaching kinematics, removing the effects of second target position. These results were due neither to a visual interference effect of the second target on reaching-grasping nor to the complexity of movement sequence. Finally, the size of the second target did not affect grasp kinematics of both patients and controls. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that PD patients are able to compute the general program of an action in which extrinsic properties of both the actual and the final target are computed. However, PD patients re-program movement during its execution. This suggests a decay of the motor program. That is, basal ganglia can be involved in storing the plan of an action and in controlling its correct execution.","Ist Fisiol Umana, I-43100 Parma, Italy",,"Gentilucci, M (corresponding author), Ist Fisiol Umana, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",,,,,,,,47,34,35,0,2,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Recent experiments have suggested that alpha band activity originating from the pulvinar coordinates this inter-areal cortical communication. Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring experimental quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.","[Quax, Silvan; Tiesinga, Paul] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst, Dept Neuroinformat, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jensen, Ole] Univ Birmingham, Ctr Human Brain Hlth, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Birmingham","Quax, S; Tiesinga, P (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst, Dept Neuroinformat, Nijmegen, Netherlands.","s.quax@donders.ru.nl; p.tiesinga@science.ru.nl","Jensenq, Ole/D-2120-2010; Quax, Silvan/Q-8683-2018; Tiesinga, Paul/D-1901-2010","Jensenq, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; Quax, Silvan/0000-0001-6685-1789; ","Neuroseeker FP7 project [600925]; James S.

Thus, it is possible that eye-hand coordination may differ in these two types of movement. To examine this issue we compared the response characteristics of combined eye and hand movements made towards visual versus remembered targets. In addition, the influence of the eye movement on the hand movement was investigated by comparing the effects of visual fixation in each task. Our results demonstrated that hand movement amplitude was greater when the hand movements were produced in isolation versus in combination with an eye movement. This was true regardless of whether the movement was made to a visual or a remembered target. This suggests that the integration of eye position information into the manual motor response occurs at a common neural site for both tasks. By contrast, the timing between saccade and hand onsets and offsets differed in the two conditions. This is consistent with the idea that the timing inherent in eye-hand coordination is the result of separate processing within either the basal ganglia or cerebellar systems. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrate that certain processes underlying eye-hand coordination during movements to visual versus remembered targets share a common neural substrate whereas others function independently.","Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","University of Oregon; University of Oregon","van Donkelaar, P (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",,,,,,,,40,42,42,0,8,"SPRINGER-VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Here we review evidence for two canonical operations within sensory cortical areas: a feedforward computation of selectivity; and a recurrent computation of gain in which, given sufficiently strong external input, perhaps from multiple sources, intracortical input largely, but not completely, cancels this external input. This operation leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple stimuli. The cortical computation must combine such local processing with hierarchical processing across areas. We point to important changes in moving from sensory cortex to motor and frontal cortex and the possibility of substantial differences between cortex in rodents vs. species with columnar organization of selectivity.","[Miller, Kenneth D.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Ctr Theoret Neurosci,Dept Neurosci,Swartz Program, New York, NY 10032 USA","Columbia University","Miller, KD (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, Ctr Theoret Neurosci,Dept Neurosci,Swartz Program, New York, NY 10032 USA.","ken@neurotheory.columbia.edu",,,"Gatsby Charitable Foundation;  [R01-EY11001]","Gatsby Charitable Foundation; ","Thanks to Roozbeh Kiani for helpful comments.

The strength of bimodal-cell response to a visual stimulus depends on its proximity to the hand. We tested the hypothesis that hand proximity to a visual stimulus would influence unconscious residual vision in the blind field. MB is a 26-year-old man with a dense upper-left quadrantanopia following surgical treatment that severed Meyer's loop, and SB is a 35-year-old man with a dense left hemianopia following childhood meningitis. Testing for hand-assisted blindsight in MB allowed us to evaluate whether phenomena related to hand proximity are dependent on information relayed through the optic radiations. We presented target objects of different sizes to the blind fields of these gentlemen, and asked them to estimate target size with their right hand by adjusting thumb-finger distance or reaching and grasping the object. Concurrently, we varied the location of the resting left hand. In the hand-far condition, the left hand rested on their lap, and in the hand-near condition, it was placed just to the left of the target object. In the hand-far condition, both patients showed no scaling of either size-estimation aperture (SEA) or peak grip aperture PGA) to object size. In the hand-near condition, however, both PGA and SEA were scaled to object size. Additional studies of MB suggest that hand proximity effects cannot be attributed solely to changes in spatial attention. These results imply that if bimodal cells are recruited when the hand is placed nearby the visual target, they must receive information from cortical areas that do not depend on the integrity of the optic radiations.

In order to assess the influences of audition on somatosensory perception, three experiments measured how task-irrelevant auditory stimuli alter detection rates for near-threshold somatosensory stimuli. In Experiment 1, we showed that a simultaneous auditory stimulus increases sensitivity, but not response biases, to the detection of an electrical cutaneous stimulus delivered to the hand. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this enhancement of somatosensory perception is spatially specific-only monaural sounds on the same side increased detection. Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of audition on touch are also frequency dependent-only sounds with the same frequency as the vibrotactile frequency enhanced tactile detection. These results indicate that auditory information influences touch perception in highly systematic ways and suggest that similar coding mechanisms may underlie the processing of information from these different sensory modalities.","[Ro, Tony] CUNY, City Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Hsu, Johanan; Yasar, Nafi E.] Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA; [Yasar, Nafi E.; Elmore, L.

To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a similar to 1.5- mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.","[Nauhaus, Ian; Ringach, Dario L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomed Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Busse, Laura; Carandini, Matteo] Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; [Carandini, Matteo] UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England; [Ringach, Dario L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ringach, Dario L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute; University of London; University College London; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Nauhaus, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomed Engn, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","inauhaus@gmail.com","Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021; Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008; Busse, Laura/AAA-5375-2021","Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Busse, Laura/0000-0002-6127-7754","US National Institutes of Health [EY-17396, EY-12816, EY-18322]; DARPA [FA8650-06-C-7633]; Oppenheimer/Stein Endowment Award; McKnight Endowment Fund; Leopoldina [BMBF-LPD9901/8165]","US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); Oppenheimer/Stein Endowment Award; McKnight Endowment Fund; Leopoldina","We are grateful to B.

By using behavioral tasks together with electro-physiological recordings it has been possible to advance in our understanding on the functional role of this area. Given its pattern of connections, the premotor ventral cortex is well suited to participate in perceptual decisions, in which sensory information is combined with knowledge on previous outcomes and expectancies to reach a behavioral choice. The neuronal correlates of the decision process have been described in several cortical areas of primates. In this work we describe our experimental results showing that different stages or elements of perceptual decisions are encoded in the firing rate of premotor ventral cortex neurons. This provides compelling evidence suggesting that this area is involved in the use of sensory evidence-maintained in working memory or retrieved from long-term memory-to reach a decision. Furthermore, after the behavioral response the same neurons convey all the information needed to evaluate the outcome of the choice. This suggests that the premotor ventral cortex could participate in shaping future behavior as a result of this evaluation.","[Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L.; Acuna, Carlos] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fisiol, Fac Med, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain; [Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L.; Acuna, Carlos] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Complejo Hosp Univ, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain; [Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L.] Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, Circuit Dynam & Computat Lab, Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Fundacao Champalimaud","Acuna, C (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Med, Labs Neurociencia, San Francisco S-N, E-15782 Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain.","carlos.acuna.castroviejo@gmail.com","Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./B-5256-2011; Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./HPF-2301-2023; Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./O-1970-2019","Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./0000-0003-4623-2440; Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./0000-0003-4623-2440; Pardo-Vazquez, Jose L./0000-0003-4623-2440",,,,,45,1,1,0,3,"REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA","BARCELONA","C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN","0210-0010","1576-6578",,"REV NEUROLOGIA","Rev.

In addition, most properties of cells in primary visual cortex can be accounted for by a model that is largely linear and processes information primarily in one direction.

We injected the tracer CTb into V1 of juvenile ferrets, and visualized the pattern of labeled axon terminals in extrastriate cortex. Bouton density of FF projections to target areas 18, 19, and 21 declined steadily from 4 to 8 weeks postnatal. However, in area Ssy this decline was delayed somewhat, not occurring until after 6 weeks. During this postnatal period, mean interbouton intervals along individual FF axons to all visual areas increased, and we observed a concomitant moderate decrease in axon density in areas 18, 21, and Ssy. These data suggest that FF circuits linking V1 to its main extrastriate targets remodel largely synchronously in the weeks following eye opening, that FF and FB cortical circuits share a broadly similar developmental timecourse, and that postnatal visual experience is critical for the refinement of both FF and FB cortical circuits.","[Khalil, Reem] Amer Univ Sharjah, Biol Chem & Environm Sci Dept, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Khalil, Reem; Contreras-Ramirez, Violeta; Levitt, Jonathan B.] CUNY, Dept Biol MR526, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Khalil, Reem; Levitt, Jonathan B.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA","American University of Sharjah; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System","Levitt, JB (corresponding author), CUNY, Dept Biol MR526, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.;Levitt, JB (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.","jlevitt@ccny.cuny.edu","Khalil, Reem/ABB-8310-2020","Khalil, Reem/0000-0002-2661-5957","National Center for Research Resources [2G12RR03060-26A1]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities from the National Institutes of Health [8G12MD007603-27]; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah","National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities from the National Institutes of Health; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah","This work was supported by grants from the National Center for Research Resources (2G12RR03060-26A1); The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (8G12MD007603-27) from the National Institutes of Health; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); and Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah.",,78,6,6,0,7,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1863-2653","1863-2661",,"BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT","Brain Struct.

To understand the mechanisms of attentive stimulus processing in this pulvinar-cortex loop, we investigated the interactions between the pulvinar, area V4, and IT cortex in a spatial-attention task. Sensory processing and the influence of attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and overall gamma coherence within V4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep. Thus, cortical interactions with the ventro-lateral pulvinar are necessary for normal attention and sensory processing and for maintaining the cortex in an active state.","[Zhou, Huihui; Schafer, Robert John; Desimone, Robert] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhou, Huihui] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS","Zhou, HH (corresponding author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhou, HH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","hh.zhou@siat.ac.cn","Desimone, Robert/G-1121-2018","Schafer, Robert/0000-0002-0874-830X; Desimone, Robert/0000-0002-5938-4227","National Institutes of Health [R01 EY017292]; Shenzhen Peacock plan [KQTD20140630180249366]; CAS Hundred Talent program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31540023]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Shenzhen Peacock plan; CAS Hundred Talent program(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank Ellen DeGennaro and Matt Heard for help with the monkeys.

We report here on the pattern of calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity within these areas. The supratemporal regions of four normal human brains (eight hemispheres) were processed histologically, and serial sections were stained for parvalbumin, calretinin or calbindin. Each calcium-binding protein yielded a specific pattern of labelling, which differed between auditory areas. In AI, defined as area TC [see C. von Economo and L. Horn (1930) Z. Ges. Neurol. Psychiatr., 130 , 678-757], parvalbumin labelling was dark in layer IV; several parvalbumin-positive multipolar neurons were distributed in layers III and IV. Calbindin yielded dark labelling in layers I-III and V; it revealed numerous multipolar and pyramidal neurons in layers II and III. Calretinin labelling was lighter than that of parvalbumin or calbindin in AI; calretinin-positive bipolar and bitufted neurons were present in supragranular layers. In non-primary auditory areas, the intensity of labelling tended to become progressively lighter while moving away from AI, with qualitative differences between the cytoarchitectonically defined areas. In analogy to non-human primates, our results suggest differences in intrinsic organization between auditory areas that are compatible with parallel and hierarchical processing of auditory information.","CHU Vaudois, Div Neuropsychol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; Univ Lausanne, Inst Physiol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland","University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); University of Lausanne","Clarke, S (corresponding author), CHU Vaudois, Div Neuropsychol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"Clarke, Stephanie/A-2845-2009","Clarke, Stephanie/0000-0001-9393-5718; Magistretti, Pierre Julius/0000-0002-6678-320X",,,,,58,48,52,0,0,"BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Here we report the effects, on the gain of LGN neurons, of differentially stimulating the extraclassical receptive field, with feedback from the striate cortex intact or inactivated in the marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. A horizontally oriented grating of optimal size, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency was presented to the classical receptive field. The grating varied in contrast (range: 0-1) from trial to trial, and was presented alone, or surrounded by a grating of the same or orthogonal orientation, contained within either a larger annular field, or flanks oriented either horizontally or vertically. V1 was ablated to inactivate cortico-geniculate feedback. The maximum firing rate of LGN neurons was greater with V1 intact, but was reduced by visually stimulating beyond the classical receptive field. Large horizontal or vertical annular gratings were most effective in reducing the maximum firing rate of LGN neurons. Magnocellular neurons were most susceptible to this inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field. Extraclassical inhibition was less effective with V1 ablated. We conclude that inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field reduces the excitatory influence of V1 in the LGN. The net balance between cortico-geniculate excitation and inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field is one mechanism by which signals relayed from the retina to V1 are controlled.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","University of Nottingham","Webb, BS (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Webb, Ben S/O-2386-2014; Easton, Alexander/B-6904-2013; Easton, Alexander/P-9824-2019; Derrington, Andrew M/A-4389-2009","Webb, Ben S/0000-0003-4344-8369; Easton, Alexander/0000-0002-6494-0080; Easton, Alexander/0000-0002-6494-0080; Barraclough, Nick/0000-0003-2818-326X; Derrington, Andrew/0000-0001-9938-4638; Tinsley, Chris/0000-0002-9369-443X",,,,,39,70,71,0,13,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA","0952-5238",,,"VISUAL NEUROSCI","Visual Neurosci.","SEP-OCT",2002,19,5,,,,,583,592,,"10.1017/S0952523802195046","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523802195046"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523802195046"")",,,10,"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","625RT",12507325,"Green Accepted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000179829900004","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000179829900004"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Anatomical studies have delineated multiple areas in and around primary auditory cortex and demonstrated connectivity among these areas, as well as between these areas and the rest of the cortex, including prefrontal cortex. Physiological recordings of auditory neurons have found that species-specific vocalizations are useful in probing the selectivity and potential functions of acoustic neurons. A number of cortical regions contain neurons that are robustly responsive to vocalizations, and some auditory responsive neurons show more selectivity for vocalizations than for other complex sounds. Demonstration of selectivity for vocalizations has prompted the question of which features are encoded by higher-order auditory neurons. Results based on detailed studies of the structure of these vocalizations, as well as the tuning and in formation-coding properties of neurons sensitive to these vocalizations, have begun to provide answers to this question. In future studies, these and other methods may help to define the way in which cells, ensembles, and brain regions process communication sounds. Moreover, the discovery that several nonprimary auditory cortical regions may be multisensory and responsive to vocalizations with corresponding facial gestures may change the way in which we view the processing of communication information by the auditory system.","[Romanski, Lizabeth M.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Averbeck, Bruno B.] UCL, Sobell Dept Motor Neurosci & Movement Disorders, Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England","University of Rochester; University of London; University College London","Romanski, LM (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.","Liz_romanski@urmc.rochester.edu",,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC004845, R01 DC004845-08] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))",,,113,122,122,0,29,"ANNUAL REVIEWS","PALO ALTO","4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA","0147-006X","1545-4126",,"ANNU REV NEUROSCI","Annu.

Animal work demonstrates that interactions among these regions are critical for flexible feedback-guided learning, but it remains unknown to what extent such anatomical-functional interactions operate in humans. Here, we use connectivity analyses in both structural and functional MRI to further our understanding of how brain circuits work in conjunction to promote goal-directed behavior. In particular, fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging provides information about anatomical connectivity between brain structures, and functional MRI provides estimates of functional connectivity between structures. We found that, during a feedback-guided reversal learning task, the strength of estimated white matter tracts from the amygdala to the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum predicted both how subjects adapted their behavior following positive and negative feedback, and the functional connectivity (estimated from functional MRI time series) between the amygdala and these regions. In addition, we identified a dissociation between an amygdala-hippocampus circuit that predicted response switching, and an amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex circuit that predicted learning following rule reversals. These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning of amygdala-related brain circuits mediate different aspects of feedback-guided learning behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Impaired smooth pursuit in humans with cerebral lesions usually signifies damage to posterior parietal hemispheric regions. The authors have recently studied horizontal smooth pursuit in 23 patients with discrete unilateral cerebral hemispheric lesions. Ten patients had pursuit asymmetry with lower gain when tracking toward the side of cerebral hemispheric damage. None had lower gain when tracking away. Two patients with lower ipsilateral gain had frontal lobe lesions. Areas of anatomical overlap of lesions associated with asymmetric pursuit in eight patients provide evidence for a pursuit pathway that originates in Brodmann's areas 19 and 39 (angular gyrus), and that these cortical areas are the human homologues of areas MT and MST in the simian cerebral cortex. A normal phase relationship between smooth eye motion and target motion in these patients indicated that prediction in the smooth pursuit system is resistant to cerebral hemispheric damage. The initiation of smooth pursuit in response to step-ramp targets was studied in 18 patients with focal cerebral hemispheric lesions. Seven patients had retinotopic pursuit defects, consisting of low smooth eye movement gain in both horizontal directions in the hemifield contralateral to the cerebral lesions. Only four of those seven patients had complete hemianopia and three had normal visual fields, indicating that 'blindness' for motion detection and/or motion generation can occur independently of damage to the geniculostriate pathway. Four patients with complete hemianopia occasionally made smooth eye accelerations to targets stepped into the blind hemifield, in the correct direction, but with low velocity. They did not adjust saccade amplitude to the direction or size of the target step. These measurements of steady state responses to sine wave targets and to step ramp targets enabled the authors to identify four classes of cerebral hemispheric smooth pursuit defects: (1) Ipsilateral low gain pursuit. Contralateral pursuit gain may be normal, low or high. (2) Bidirectional low gain smooth pursuit. (3) Retinotopic impairment of pursuit in both directions in the contralateral visual field. (4) Craniotopic paralysis of pursuit contralateral to the midline after acute nondominant hemispheric lesions.","UNIV TORONTO,TORONTO HOSP,NEUROOPHTHALMOL UNIT,TORONTO M5S 1A1,ONTARIO,CANADA","University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto","SHARPE, JA (corresponding author), UNIV TORONTO,TORONTO HOSP,DIV NEUROL,399 BATHURST ST,TORONTO MST 258,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,,72,5,5,0,2,"AEOLUS PRESS","BUREN","PO BOX 740, 4116 ZJ BUREN, NETHERLANDS","0165-8107",,,"NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY","Neuro-Ophthalmol.","APR",1991,11,2,,,,,87,98,,"10.3109/01658109108997300","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/01658109108997300"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/01658109108997300"")",,,12,"Clinical Neurology; Ophthalmology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology","FE385",,,,,"2023-08-20","WOS:A1991FE38500004","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:A1991FE38500004"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Intense staining for both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was observed in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons in this nucleus. In comparison to GluR1, less intense staining for GluR2/3 was observed in the cell bodies and processes. NMDAR1 immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies and large numbers of small diameter dendrites. Light staining was observed in cell bodies with mGluR1a and no staining was observed on cell bodies with mGluR5. The neuropil, however, contained many processes that were labeled for mGluR1a or mGluR5. Electron microscopy showed that label was present in cytoplasmic locations in cell bodies and dendrites, in addition to components of the synaptic region, in sections stained for GluR1, GluR2/3 and NMDAR1. In contrast, very lightly labeled or unlabeled cell bodies but labeled dendrites and axon terminals, was observed in sections stained for mGluR1a and mGluR5. In addition to neural processes, occasional astrocytic processes were also labeled for mGluR5. Of the immunogold particles that were associated with components of the synaptic region, label for ionotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present on postsynaptic densities, whilst that for metabotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present in a perisynaptic location. The ratio of GluR1/GluR2 messenger RNAs has been reported to increase in the aged hippocampus (PAGLIUSI, S. R., GERRARD, P., ABDALLAH, M., TALABOT, D. & CATSICAS, S. (1994) Neuroscience 61, 429-433.), and it is possible that a similar change in the ratio of GluR1 and GluR2 may occur in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus with age. It is postulated that this could result an increase in calcium permeability via AMPA receptors, and an enhancement of excitatory transmission in this nucleus.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Anat, Singapore 119260, Singapore; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","National University of Singapore; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Johns Hopkins University","Ong, WY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Anat, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",,,,,,,,49,12,12,0,2,"KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-4864",,,"J NEUROCYTOL","J.

The latter are nearly exclusively of the spinous type and are predominantly located in upper layer IV. Retrograde transport of the carbocyanine dye DiI, applied to the corpus callosum, showed that, up to P6, all callosally projecting neurons resemble pyramids in the possession of an apical dendrite reaching layer I. At P10. however, callosally projecting neurons with stellate morphology were found. A study was designed to distinguish whether these neurons are late in extending their axons to the corpus callosum or, alternatively, have transient apical dendrites. To this end, callosally projecting neurons were retrogradely labeled by fluorescent beads injected in areas 17 and 18 at P1-P3 and then either relabeled with DiI applied to the corpus callosum at P10 or intracellularly injected with Lucifer Yellow at P57. Double-labeled stellate and pyramidal cells were found in similar proportions to those found for the total, single-labeled population of callosally projecting neurons. It is therefore concluded that callosally projecting spiny stellate cells initially possess an apical dendrite and a pyramidal morphology. At P6, i.e. close to the time when stellate cells appear, layer IV neurons with an atrophic apical dendrite were found, suggestive of an apical dendrite in the process of being eliminated.","INST ANAT,9 RUE BUGNON,CH-1005 LAUSANNE,SWITZERLAND",,,,"Vercelli, Alessandro E/A-1926-2012","Vercelli, Alessandro E/0000-0002-5909-2128",,,,,67,48,50,0,1,"SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0014-4819",,,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

The present electrophysiological study identified the corresponding area in rats as a vagal afferent projection region and examined the cytoarchitecture. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve elicited a field potential comparable in waveform, latency, and amplitude to the simultaneously evoked potential in the insular Visceral sensory cortex. The potential field adjoined the S1 trigeminal region without overlap, and was rostroventral to the lip representation barrel field, which was identified histochemically, and rostrodorsal to the tongue representation region, which was identified electrophysiologically. The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex or the S1, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated. The rat S1 contains a region representing general visceral information, topographically located as if the visceral organs protruded from the mouth.

Cortex rostral and caudal to the primary somatosensory area (SI) contained neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and to muscle and joint manipulation. The region of cortex rostral to SI was termed the rostral field (R) because of possible homologies with a similar field described in other mammals. Cortex caudal to SI had neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and has been termed the parietal medial area (PM), as in previous investigations in squirrels. Like SI, both R and PM contained a complete or almost complete representation of the body surface, although the receptive field size for clusters of neurons in these regions was somewhat larger than those for clusters of neurons in SI. Electrophysiological recording results were correlated with histologically processed tissue that had been sectioned tangentially. Although SI was clearly identified as a myelin-dense region, both R and PM stained much less densely for myelin. Our results indicate that as in a number of other mammals including monotremes, marsupials, carnivores, and primates, the anterior parietal cortex of the California ground squirrel contains multiple representations of the sensory epithelium. This work, as well as a growing body of studies of somatosensory cortex organization in a variety of mammals, indicates that anterior parietal fields other than SI existed early in mammalian evolution, and were present in the common ancestor of all mammals.

A battery of attentional, motion and mnemonic processing tasks were used and performance was examined during deactivation of each region. The results show a clear dissociation of functions. Deactivation of MS cortex resulted in profound deficits on a visual orienting task and on the discrimination of direction of motion, whereas deactivation of vPS cortex severely impaired both retention and learning of novel and overlearned object discriminations. In addition, deactivation of either MS or vPS cortex impaired discrimination of learned patterns when components of the patterns were in motion, whereas only deactivation of vPS cortex impaired the discrimination when all components were static. Together, these results show that a region of parietal cortex contributes to the processing of visual motion and to attentional processes, whereas a region of temporal cortex contributes to the learning and recognition of three-dimensional objects and two-dimensional patterns. This functional dissociation is linked to differences in underlying visual pathways, which have many features in common with the parietal and temporal visual processing streams previously identified in monkeys and humans. Furthermore. the broad similarity in neural operations carried out in parietal and temporal cortices of cats, monkeys and humans suggests the existence of a common plan for cortical processing machinery within mammals with well developed cerebral cortices.","PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Lomber, SG (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,LAB VISUAL PERCEPT & COGNIT,700 ALBANY ST,BOSTON,MA 02118, USA.",,"Lomber, Stephen G/B-6820-2015","Lomber, Stephen G/0000-0002-3001-7909","PHS HHS [32137] Funding Source: Medline","PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service)",,,83,76,76,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513","1047-3211",,,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

In turn, the CM/Pf complex receives a substantial innervation from the internal globus pallidus (GPi). In this study, we demonstrate that the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also provides a massive input to Pf in monkeys. These pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projections provide routes whereby information can flow in functional loops between the basal ganglia and the intralaminar nuclear group. To understand better the anatomical organization and the degree of functional specificity of these loops, we combined retrograde and anterograde labeling methods from functionally defined regions of the striatum and GPi/SNr to determine the relationships between thalamostriatal neurons and basal ganglia afferents. Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the basal ganglia and the CM/Pf in primates: 1) A sensorimotor circuit links together the medial two-thirds of CM, the postcommissural putamen, and the ventrolateral part of the caudal GPi; 2) a limbic circuit involves the rostral one-third of Pf, the ventral striatum, and the rostromedial pole of GPi; and 3) an associative circuit exists between the caudal two-thirds of Pf, the caudate nucleus, and the SNr. An additional associative circuit that involves the caudate-receiving territory of GPi (dorsal one-third), the dorsolateral Pf (Pfdl), and the precommissural putamen was also disclosed. In conclusion, findings of this study provide additional evidence for the high degree of functional specificity of the thalamostriatal system through which CM/Pf may provide attention-specific sensory information important for conditional responses to the primate striatum.

The removal of this area alone does not cause either paralysis or akinesia. However, the animals were poor at performing a simple learned task in which they had to carry out an arbitrary action: they were taught to raise their arm in order to obtain food in a foodwell below. They were impaired whether they worked in the light or the dark. They were impaired when they had to perform the movements at their own pace, but much less impaired when a tone paced performance. Monkeys with lesions in the anterior cingulate cortex were as impaired as monkeys with medial premotor lesions at performing this task at their own pace. However, monkeys with lateral premotor lesions were less impaired. We conclude that the medial premotor areas play a crucial role in the performance of learned movements when there is no external stimulus to prompt performance.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND; SHANGHAI BRAIN RES INST, SHANGHAI 200031, PEOPLES R CHINA; MGH, NMR CTR, BOSTON, MA 02129 USA; BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSP, DEPT NEUROL, BOSTON, MA 02116 USA","University of Oxford; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital",,,,,"Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline","Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)",,,42,136,138,0,7,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106",,"EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.","[Mante, Valerio; Bonin, Vincent; Carandini, Matteo] Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA","The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute","Mante, V (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 1318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.","valerio@monkeybiz.stanford.edu","Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008; Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021; Bonin, Vincent/AAQ-3833-2020","Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Bonin, Vincent/0000-0002-9437-8092",,,,,92,86,86,0,16,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0896-6273",,,"NEURON","Neuron","MAY 22",2008,58,4,,,,,625,638,,"10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.011","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.011"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.011"")",,,14,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","304PD",18498742,"Bronze",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000256120500015","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000256120500015"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the cortical sensory representation of the oral area, including the teeth. First, we identified the somatotopic representation of the lips, teeth and tongue in the postcentral gyrus (GpoC). Tactile stimuli were applied to the lower lip, tongue and teeth. The foci activated by each stimulus were characterized by the center of gravity (COG) of activated areas. Secondly, we examined the rostro-caudal changes in the somatotopic organization in the GPoC in terms of the overlap between each sensory representation. In the rostral portion of the GPoC, the COG of the representation of teeth was located significantly superior to that of the tongue and inferior to that of the lip, consistent with the classical 'sensory homunculus' proposed by Penfield; however, this somatotopic representation became unclear in the middle and caudal portions of the GPoC. The overlap between each representation in the middle and caudal portions of the GPoC was significantly greater than that in the rostral portion of the GPoC. These findings support the theory that the input from oral structures converges hierarchically across the primary somatosensory cortex.","Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch, Tokyo 1138549, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, SORST, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, RISTEX, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Univ Fukui, Fac Med Sci, Dept Funct Neuroimaging, Fukui 9101193, Japan","National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); University of Fukui","Sadato, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","sadato@nips.ac.jp","HONDA, Manabu/AAO-1202-2020; Ono, Takashi/ABC-4644-2020","Ono, Takashi/0000-0002-8043-660X; Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907; Okada, Tomohisa/0000-0003-2312-5677; gong ben, shun/0000-0003-4166-4885",,,,,54,77,82,0,7,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Specifically, auditory inputs were shown to suppress activations in visual cortices when presented alone but amplify the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to concurrent visual inputs (and vice versa). This concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation-functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) study applied repetitive TMS trains at no, low, and high intensity over right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and vertex to investigate top-down influences on visual and auditory cortices under 3 sensory contexts: visual, auditory, and no stimulation. IPS-TMS increased activations in auditory cortices irrespective of sensory context as a result of direct and nonspecific auditory TMS side effects. In contrast, IPS-TMS modulated activations in the visual cortex in a state-dependent fashion: it deactivated the visual cortex under no and auditory stimulation but amplified the BOLD response to visual stimulation. However, only the response amplification to visual stimulation was selective for IPS-TMS, while the deactivations observed for IPS- and Vertex-TMS resulted from crossmodal deactivations induced by auditory activity to TMS sounds. TMS to IPS may increase the responses in visual (or auditory) cortices to visual (or auditory) stimulation via a gain control mechanism or crossmodal interactions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that understanding TMS effects on (uni)sensory processing requires a multisensory perspective.","[Leitao, Joana; Thielscher, Axel; Werner, Sebastian; Pohmann, Rolf; Noppeney, Uta] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Cognit Neuroimaging Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Leitao, Joana; Thielscher, Axel; Werner, Sebastian; Pohmann, Rolf; Noppeney, Uta] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, High Field Magnet Resonance Ctr, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Noppeney, Uta] Univ Birmingham, Computat Neurosci & Cognit Robot Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of Birmingham","Leitao, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Cognit Neuroimaging Grp, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.","joana.leitao@tuebingen.mpg.de","Pohmann, Rolf/B-1122-2010; Leitao, Joana/AAC-7945-2020","Pohmann, Rolf/0000-0002-6137-9590; Thielscher, Axel/0000-0002-4752-5854; Noppeney, Uta/0000-0002-7697-2290","Max Planck Society; Lundbeck Foundation [R118-2012-11308] Funding Source: researchfish","Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Lundbeck Foundation(Lundbeckfonden)","Max Planck Society.",,84,23,24,1,42,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199",,"CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Here we asked if orientation selectivity, once established, is altered by successive stages of cortical processing. We measured patterns of orientation selectivity at all depths of the cat's visual cortex by making whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes. Our results show that the synaptic representation of orientation indeed changes with position in the microcircuit, as information passes from layer 4 to layer 2+3 to layer 5. At the earliest cortical stage, for simple cells in layer 4, orientation tuning curves for excitation (depolarization) and inhibition (hyperpolarization) had similar peaks (within 0-7 deg, n = 11) and bandwidths. Further, the sharpness of orientation selectivity covaried with receptive field geometry (r = 0.74) - the more elongated the strongest subregion, the shaper the tuning. Tuning curves for complex cells in layer 2+3 also had similar peaks (within 0-4 deg, n = 7) and bandwidths. By contrast, at a later station, layer 5, the preferred orientation for excitation and inhibition diverged such that the peaks of the tuning curves could be as far as 90 deg apart (average separation, 54 deg; n = 6). Our results support the growing consensus that orientation selectivity is generated at the earliest cortical level and structured similarly for excitation and inhibition. Moreover, our novel finding that the relative tuning of excitation and inhibition changes with laminar position helps resolve prior controversy about orientation selectivity at later phases of processing and gives a mechanistic view of how the cortical circuitry recodes orientation.","Rockefeller Univ, Neurobiol Lab, New York, NY 10021 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Rockefeller University; University of Connecticut; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School","Hirsch, JA (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, HNB 328,M-C 2520,3641 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","jhirsch@usc.edu","Hirsch, Judith/E-9006-2013",,"NEI NIH HHS [EY09395] Funding Source: Medline","NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))",,,78,88,88,0,4,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3751","1469-7793",,"J PHYSIOL-LONDON","J.

To determine the relative contribution of the cFN efferent pathways to the brainstem reticular formation and to the superior colliculus (SC), we recorded in the head-unrestrained cat the effects of cFN unilateral inactivation on gaze shifts evoked by electrical microstimulation of the deeper SC layers. Gaze shifts evoked after muscimol injection still exhibited the typical qualitative features of normal saccadic gaze shifts. Nevertheless, consistent modifications in amplitude and latency were observed. For ipsiversive movements (evoked by the SC contralateral to the inactivated cFN), these changes depended on the locus of stimulation on the motor map: for the anterior 2/3 of the SC, amplitude increased and latency tended to decrease; for the posterior 1/3 of the SC, amplitude decreased and latency increased. For the contraversive direction, amplitude moderately decreased and latency tended to increase for all but the caudal-most stimulated SC site. These modifications of SC-evoked gaze shifts during cFN inactivation differed from the ipsiversive hypermetria/contraversive hypometria pattern observed for visually triggered gaze shifts recorded during the same recording sessions. We conclude that (i) the topographical organization of gaze shift amplitude in the deeper SC layers is influenced by the cerebellum and is either severely distorted or demonstrates an amplitude reduction during inactivation of the contralateral or ipsilateral cFN, respectively; (ii) gaze shifts evoked by SC microstimulation and visually triggered gaze shifts either rely on distinct cerebellar-dependent control processes or differ by the location of the caudal-most active SC population. We present a functional scheme providing several predictions regarding the modulatory influence of the cerebellum on SC neuronal activities and on the topographical organization of fastigial-SC projections.","INSERM, U534, F-69500 Bron, France","Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)","Pelisson, D (corresponding author), INSERM, U534, 16 Ave Doyen Lepine, F-69500 Bron, France.","pelisson@lyon151.inserm.fr","Pelisson, Denis/H-2916-2017","Pelisson, Denis/0000-0002-9114-7758",,,,,88,13,13,0,0,"WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0953-816X",,,"EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Increasing target luminance resulted in multiple modulations of the visual response, including increased magnitude and decreased response onset latency. These signal modulations correlated strongly with changes in saccade latency and metrics, indicating that these signal properties carry through to the neural computations that determine when, where and how fast the eyes will move. Thus, components of the earliest part of the visual response in the SC provide important building blocks for the neural basis of the sensorymotor transformation, highlighting a critical link between the properties of the visual response and saccade behavior.","[Marino, Robert A.; Levy, Ron; Boehnke, Susan; White, Brian J.; Munoz, Douglas P.] Queens Univ, Ctr Neurosci Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Munoz, Douglas P.] Queens Univ, Dept Biomed & Mol Sci, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Munoz, Douglas P.] Queens Univ, Dept Psychol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Munoz, Douglas P.] Queens Univ, Dept Med, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Levy, Ron] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Div Neurosurg, Dept Clin Neurosci,Foothills Med Ctr, Calgary, AB T2N 2T9, Canada; [Itti, Laurent] Univ So Calif, Dept Comp Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; Queens University - Canada; University of Calgary; University of Southern California","Munoz, DP (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Ctr Neurosci Studies, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.","doug.munoz@queensu.ca","Boehnke, Susan/P-4952-2019","Boehnke, Susan/0000-0002-0726-6659","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP-77734]; National Science Foundation; Queen's University; Canada Research Chair Program","Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Queen's University; Canada Research Chair Program(Canada Research Chairs)","We thank Ann Lablans, Rebecca Cranham, Mike Lewis, Sean Hickman and Fred Paquin for outstanding technical assistance and Irene Armstrong for assistance with the statistical analysis.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of surround suppression in V1. Using stationary-flashed sinusoidal grating as stimuli, we observed temporal changes of surround suppression in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and of the response to CRF stimulation in V1. The spatial frequency (SF) tuning of surround suppression in V1 neurons changed over time after the stimulus onset. In the early phase (< 50 ms), the SF tuning was low-pass, but later became band-pass that tuned to the optimal SF in response to CRF stimulation. On the other hand, the SF tuning of CRF responses in V1 was band-pass throughout the response time whereas the SF peak shifted slightly toward high SF. Thus, SF tuning properties of the CRF response dissociated from that of surround suppression in V1 only in the early phase. We also confirmed that the temporal changes of the SF tuning of surround suppression in the LGN occurred in the same direction as surround suppression in V1, but the shift from low-pass to band-pass SF tuning started later than that in V1. From these results, we suggest that subcortical mechanisms contribute to early surround suppression in V1, whereas cortical mechanisms contribute to late surround suppression.","[Ishikawa, Ayako; Shimegi, Satoshi; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Lab Cognit & Behav Neurosci, Osaka, Japan; [Ishikawa, Ayako; Shimegi, Satoshi; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Kida, Hiroyuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan","Osaka University; Osaka University; Osaka University","Shimegi, S (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Lab Cognit & Behav Neurosci, 1-17 Machikaneyama, Osaka, Japan.","shimegi@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp",,,"MEXT, Japan [17022026, 18020018, 19530656, 20020016]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17022026, 20020016, 18020018, 19530656] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Drs Tomoyuki Naito, Osamu Sadakane and Vincent Bonin for discussions and comments, and Dr Peter Karagiannis for kindly reading the manuscript.

A Bayesian modeling approach to quantify the probability of ipsilateral activations revealed that areas OP 1, OP 4, and OP 3 of the SII cortex as well as the trunk and face representations within all SI subareas (areas 3b, 1, and 2) show robust bilateral responses to unilateral stimulation. Such bilateral response properties are in good agreement with the transcallosal projections demonstrated for these areas in nonhuman primates and other mammals. In contrast, the SI hand region showed a different pattern. Whereas ipsilateral areas 3b and 1 were deactivated by tactile hand stimulation, particularly on the left, there was strong evidence for ipsilateral processing of information from the right hand in area 2. These results demonstrate not only the behavioral importance of the hand representation, but also suggest that area 2 may have particularly evolved to form the cortical substrate of these specialized demands, in line with recent studies on cortical evolution hypothesizing that area 2 has developed with increasing manual abilities in anthropoid primates featuring opposable thumbs.","[Eickhoff, S.

It is well known that different visual functions and their underlying circuitry mature and attain adultlike characteristics at different stages in postnatal development with varying growth rates. The developmental timecourse and duration of refinement varies significantly both in V1 of various species and among different visual cortical areas; while basic visual functions like spatial acuity mature earlier requiring less time, higher form perception such as contour integration is more complex and requires longer postnatal time to refine. This review will highlight the importance of systematic comparative analysis of the differential rates of refinement of visual circuitry and function as that may help reveal underlying key mechanisms necessary for healthy visual development during infancy and adulthood. This type of approach will help future studies to establish direct links between various developmental aspects of different visual cortical areas in both human and animal models; thus enhancing our understanding of vision related neurological disorders and their potential therapeutic remedies.","[Danka Mohammed, Chand Parvez; Khalil, Reem] Amer Univ Sharjah, Biosci & Bioengn Res Inst BBRI, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Khalil, Reem] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Biol Chem & Environm Sci, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates","American University of Sharjah; American University of Sharjah","Khalil, R (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Biosci & Bioengn Res Inst BBRI, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.;Khalil, R (corresponding author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Biol Chem & Environm Sci, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.","rkhalil@aus.edu","Mohammed, Chand parvez Danka/AAR-4518-2021; Khalil, Reem/ABB-8310-2020","Khalil, Reem/0000-0002-2661-5957","Biosciences and Bioengineering Research Institute [BBRI-AS0214]; Faculty Research Grant American University of Sharjah (AUS) [FRG-AS0204]; American University of Sharjah","Biosciences and Bioengineering Research Institute; Faculty Research Grant American University of Sharjah (AUS); American University of Sharjah","This work is supported by grants from the Biosciences and Bioengineering Research Institute (BBRI-AS0214), and Faculty Research Grant (FRG-AS0204) American University of Sharjah (AUS).

This property is generated by a neuronal ring attractor that is updated using rotation velocity cues. The properties and origin of this velocity drive remain, however, unknown. We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.","[Laurens, Jean; Angelaki, Dora E.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Baylor College of Medicine","Laurens, J (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA.","jean.laurens@gmail.com",,,"NIH [R21-NS098146, R01-DC004260]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This study was supported by NIH grants R21-NS098146 and R01-DC004260.",,87,32,32,1,21,"CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","0896-6273","1097-4199",,"NEURON","Neuron","JAN 17",2018,97,2,,,,,275,289,,"10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.020","=HYPERLINK(""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.020"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.020"")",,,15,"Neurosciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Neurosciences & Neurology","FS8VE",29346751,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-20","WOS:000422692000007","=HYPERLINK(""https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofscience.com%2Fwos%2Fwoscc%2Ffull-record%2FWOS:000422692000007"",""View Full Record in Web of Science"")"

These studies highlighted the need for detailed anatomic analyses to delineate its many cortical fields more clearly. In the present study, neurofilament protein, and the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin were used as neurochemical markers to study the differences among areas and subareas in the distributions of particular cell types or neuropil staining patterns. The most rostral parts of the anterior cingulate cortex were marked by a lower density of neurofilament protein-containing neurons, which were virtually restricted to layers V and VI. Immunoreactive layer III neurons, in contrast, were sparse in the anterior cingulate cortex, and reached maximal densities in the posterior cingulate cortex. These neurons were more prevalent in dorsal than in ventral portions of the gyrus. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons generally had the same distribution. Calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive nonpyramidal neurons had a more uniform distribution along the gyrus. Calbindin-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were more abundant anteriorly than posteriorly, and a population of calretinin-immunoreactive pyramidal-like neurons in layer V was found largely in the most anterior and ventral portions of the gyrus. Neuropil labeling with parvalbumin and calbindin was most dense in layer III of the anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, parvalbumin-immunoreactive axonal cartridges were most dense in layer V of area 24a. Calretinin immunoreactivity showed less regional specificity, with the exception of areas 29 and 30. These chemoarchitectonic features may represent cellular reflections of functional specializations in distinct domains of the cingulate cortex.

The responses of 126 neurons in primary gustatory cortices of two rhesus monkeys were recorded during sapid stimulation of the tongue with 18 taste stimuli. Ten of these stimuli were dissolved in distilled water (DW): 1.0 M sucrose (Suc), 0.1 M and 0.03 M sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.003 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), 0.001 M quinine hydrochloride (QHCl), 0.03 M monosodium glutamate (MSG), 0.03 M polycose, 0.3 M glycine, 0.1 M proline, and 0.1 M malic acid. Seven other stimuli were dissolved in 0.03 M MSG; the last stimulus was a mixture of 1.0 M Suc and 0.03 M NaCl. 2. The average spontaneous rate (2.2 +/- 0.2 spikes/s, mean +/- SE) and response to DW (2.5 i 0.2) of these 126 neurons was low but within the range previously reported for neurons in primate taste cortex. Suc was the most effective stimulus for 24.1% of the neurons tested followed by NaCl (15.7%), QHCl (14.8%), HCl (11.1%), MSG (10.2%), and other miscellaneous unitary gustatory stimuli (8.3%). Binary taste mixtures were the most effective stimuli for 15.7% of the sample. The net responses (corrected for DW, in spikes/s) for Sue-best (3.3), NaCl-best (4.3), HCl-best (3.4), QHCl-best (2.3), and MSG-best (4.1) were sluggish, but comparable with that reported previously. 3. The response breadth of the 82 neurons that responded best to either Sue, NaCl, HCl, or QHCl measured with the entropy coefficient indicated a moderate response breadth for these neurons (mean = 0.79; range = 0.30-0.98). According to the response criteria adopted in this experiment (water response +/- 1.96 SD), however, 81 of these 82 neurons (98.1%) responded to only one or two of the four basic taste stimuli. The disparity between the entropy- and criterion-based measures of response derive from the nature of the two statistics. Adjustments that would make the entropy statistic less inclusive and the definition of a response according to statistical criteria less exclusive would increase their concordance. 4. Three multivariate statistics (cluster, principal axis factor, and multidimensional analysis) were used to analyze the data. Cluster analysis enabled us to divide the 82 taste neurons into groups on the basis of response similarity. Each of the four largest groups was dominated by neurons that responded best to one of the four basic taste stimuli: Suc, NaCl, QHCl, and HCl (ranked in descending order); the fifth largest cluster contained neurons that responded best to MSG. Principal axis factor analysis demonstrated that 80.8% of the total variance could be accounted for by three factors. Neurons responding best to Suc, NaCl, and QHCl each were closely associated with one of those three factors, but the loadings of the HCl-best neurons were evenly distributed across all three factors. The communality coefficient of these three factors was > 80% for the Suc-, NaCl-, HCl-, and QHCl-best neurons; the MSG-best neurons, by comparison, had very few high loadings on any of these three factors and a correspondingly low communality coefficient of 40.4%, a difference that was statistically significant from the other four groups. Thus the three factors related to Suc-, NaCl-, HCl-, and QHCl-best neurons are not relevant to MSG-best neurons. We used multidimensional analysis to arrange the neurons that responded best to Suc, NaCl, HCl, QHCl, and MSG into five loosely arranged and partially overlapping clusters. A multidimensional space based on stimulus similarity showed that MSG was as different from the four basic taste stimuli as they were from one another. 5. Mixture suppression, a common observation in human psychophysical experiments, was examined at the neurophysiological level by including binary tastants in the stimulus battery. The average response of 19 Suc-best neurons to 1.0 M Suc (4.1 spikes/s) decreased to near 0 when the solvent was changed from DW to either 0.03 M MSG or 0.03 M NaCl. Similar decrements were observed in NaCl- and MSG-best neurons tested with Suc/NaCl mixtures. The addition of 0.03 M NaCl to 1.0 M Suc caused the across neuron profile of evoked activity to shift away from Suc and toward NaCl. The profile of the Suc/MSG mixture, on the other hand, resembled neither of the constituent stimuli. These data suggest that the Sue-salt mixtures underwent changes in both taste intensity and quality.","PENN STATE UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROSCI,HERSHEY,PA 17033; PENN STATE UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT BEHAV SCI,HERSHEY,PA 17033","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health",,,,,"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC-00246] Funding Source: Medline","NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))",,,93,15,15,0,2,"AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814","0022-3077",,,"J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

A clear distinction between cortico-subthalamic (hyperdirect) and cortico-tegmental projections (superolateral medial forebrain bundle, slMFB) so far is elusive. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the slMFB (for major depression, MD and obsessive compulsive disorders, OCD) has on the one hand been interpreted as actually involving limbic (prefrontal) hyperdirect pathways. On the other hand slMFB's stimulation region in the mesencephalic ventral tegmentum is said to impact on other structures too, going beyond the antidepressant (or anti OCD) efficacy of sole modulation of the cortico-tegmental reward-associated pathways. We have here used a normative diffusion MRT template (HCP, n = 80) for long-range tractography and augmented this dataset with ex-vivo high resolution data (n = 1) in a stochastic brain space. We compared this data with histological information and used the high resolution ex-vivo data set to scrutinize the mesencephalic tegmentum for small fiber pathways present. Our work resolves an existing ambiguity between slMFB and prefrontal hyperdirect pathways which-for the first time-are described as co-existent. DBS of the slMFB does not appear to modulate prefrontal hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic but rather cortico-tegmental projections. Smaller fiber structures in the target region-as far as they can be discerned-appear not to be involved in slMFB DBS. Our work enfeebles previous anatomical criticism and strengthens the position of the slMFB DBS target for its use in MD and OCD.","[Coenen, Volker A.; Doebroessy, Mate D.; Wessolleck, Johanna; Sajonz, Bastian E.

Myelinated fibers terminating in layer IV of the cortex were abundant in the primary sensory cortical areas (areas S1, R, and PV of somatosensory cortex; primary visual cortex) as well as the frontal cortex. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was particularly intense in the neuropil and somata of somatosensory regions (S1, R, and PV areas) but was poor in motor cortex. Immunoreactivity with the SMI-32 antibody was largely confined to a single sublayer of layer V pyramidal neurons in discrete subregions of the somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as a large field in the frontal cortex (Fr1). Surprisingly, SMI-32 neurons were absent from the motor cortex. In AChE preparations, S1, R, V1, and A regions displayed intense reactivity in supragranular layers. Our findings indicate that there is substantial regional differentiation in the expanded frontal cortex of this monotreme. Although we agree with many of the boundaries identified by previous authors in this unusual mammal (Abbie [19401 J. Comp.

In the mammalian cerebral cortex, excitatory neurons have been ascribed to one of two main dendritic morphologies, either pyramidal or stellate, which differ mainly on the extent of the apical dendrite. Developmental mechanisms regulating the emergence and refinement of dendritic morphologies have been studied for cortical pyramidal neurons, but little is known for spiny stellate neurons. Using biolistics to label single cells on acute brain slices of the ferret primary visual cortex, we show that neurons in layer 4 develop in a two-step process: initially, all neurons appear pyramidal, growing a prominent apical dendrite and few small basal dendrites. Later, a majority of these neurons show a change in the relative extent of basal and apical dendrites that results in a gradual sculpting into a stellate morphology. We also find that similar to 22% of neurons maintain the proportionality of their dendritic arbors, remaining as pyramidal cells at maturity. When ferrets were deprived of retinal input at early stages of postnatal development by binocular enucleation, a significant proportion of layer 4 spiny neurons failed to remodel their apical dendrites, and similar to 55% remained as pyramidal neurons. Our results demonstrate that cortical spiny stellate neurons emerge by differential sculpting of the dendritic arborizations of an initial pyramidal morphology and that sensory input plays a fundamental role in this process.","[Borrell, Vctor] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Inst Neurociencias, Sant Joan dAlacant 03550, Spain; [Callaway, Edward M.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante (IN); Salk Institute","Borrell, V (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Inst Neurociencias, Ave Ramon y Cajal S-N, Sant Joan dAlacant 03550, Spain.","vborrell@umh.es","Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011; Borrell, Victor/U-1802-2017","Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267; Borrell, Victor/0000-0002-7833-3978","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [BFU2006-08961/BFI, SAF2009-07367, CSD2007-00023]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government)","This work was generously supported by The International Human Frontier Science Program Organization, Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Grants BFU2006-08961/BFI and SAF2009-07367, and CONSOLIDER Grant CSD2007-00023 (V.B.).

We report that a novel pathway from the anterior cingulate cortex, an area which has a key role in attention, projects directly to the primary olfactory cortex in rhesus monkeys, innervating mostly the anterior olfactory nucleus. Axons from the anterior cingulate cortex formed synapses mostly with spines of putative excitatory pyramidal neurons and with a small proportion of a neurochemical class of inhibitory neurons that are thought to have disinhibitory effect on excitatory neurons. This novel pathway from the anterior cingulate is poised to exert a powerful excitatory effect on the anterior olfactory nucleus, which is a critical hub for odorant processing via extensive bilateral connections with primary olfactory cortices and the olfactory bulb. Acting on the anterior olfactory nucleus, the anterior cingulate may activate the entire primary olfactory cortex to mediate the process of rapid attention to olfactory stimuli.","[Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel A.; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Boston University; Boston University; Boston University","Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","gcabezas@bu.edu; barbas@bu.edu","García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023","Garcia-Cabezas, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-0534-5182; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832","National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01NS024760]; National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health [RO1MH057414]; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center [NSF SBE-0354378]; Fundacion Alicia Koplowitz (Spain)","National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Mental Health; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Fundacion Alicia Koplowitz (Spain)","We thank Isabel Park and Justin Tepes for technical assistance; Marcia Feinberg and Clare Timbie for outstanding electron microscopy assistance; Dr. Ron Killiany for assistance with imaging; Dr. Angela Carville and Dr. Leah Makaron for veterinary care and surgical assistance; Dr. Basilis Zikopoulos, Dr. Jamie Bunce, Dr. Yohan John and Dr. Maria Medalla for helpful discussion of the manuscript.

Using a novel 2DG/immunostaining technique to double-label hamster barrel cortex for metabolism and phenotype, we have recently shown that while many GABAergic neurons are heavily 2DG labeled during normal exploratory behavior, a subset of GABAergic cells shows relatively sparse 2DG labeling. For this study we used the 2DG/immunostaining technique to test whether, in awake behaving animals, calcium-binding protein expression in a given cell in barrel cortex (as indicated by immunohistochemistry for PV or CA) was related to the degree of 2DG labeling. We found that most PVC cells were moderately to heavily 2DG labeled, while most CA+ cells were lightly 2DG labeled. Our data indicate that the PV+ and CA+ cells represent metabolically distinct subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in barrel cortex. This distinction corresponds well with the in vitro physiological and anatomical data from frontal cortex and suggests functional implications for the expression of PV and CA, or other colocalized factors, in normally functioning cortical circuitry.

Usually, the location and modality of the stimulus is represented by the location and specificity of the receptor and the intensity of the stimulus and its temporal modulation is thought to be encoded by the instantaneous firing rate. Recent studies have shown that, primarily in cortical structures, special features of a stimulus also are represented in the temporal pattern of spike activity. Typical attributes of this time structure are oscillatory patterns of activity and synchronous discharges in spatially distributed neurons that respond to inputs evoked by a coherent object. The origin and functional significance of this kind of activity is less clear. Cortical, subcortical and even very peripheral sources seem to be involved. Most of the relevant studies were devoted to the mammalian visual system and cortical findings on temporally structured activity were reviewed recently (Eckhorn, 1994, Progr. Brain Res., Vol. 102, pp. 405-426; Singer and Gray, 1995, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., Vol. 18, pp. 555-586). Therefore, this article is designed to give an overview, especially of those studies concerned with the temporal structure of visual activity in subcortical centers of the primary visual pathway, which are the retina and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We discuss the mechanisms that possibly contribute to the generation and modulation of the subcortical activity time structure and we try to relate to each other the subcortical and cortical patterns of sensory activity.

In the striatum, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the rostroventral half of the putamen and is characterized by enhanced matriceal PV and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (4). The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the caudate nucleus (Cd) and rostral putamen (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal CB-ir. The third and fourth territories M and T4) comprise rostroventral parts of Cd and PuT characterized by complementary patch/matrix distributions of CB- and CR-ir, and the accumbens nucleus (Acb), respectively. The latter is separated into lateral (prominently enhanced in CB-ir) and medial (prominently enhanced in CR-ir) subdivisions. In the pallidum, parallel gradients also delimit four territories, T1 in the caudal half of external (GPe) and internal (GPi) divisions, characterized by enhanced PV- and SMI-32-ir; T2 in their rostral half, characterized by enhanced CB-ir; and T3 and T4 in their rostroventral pole and in the subpallidal area, respectively, both expressing CB- and CR-ir but with different intensities. The subthalamic nucleus (STh) shows contrasting patterns of dense PV-ir (sparing only the most medial part) and low CB-ir. Expression of CR-ir is relatively low, except in the medial, low PV-ir, part of the nucleus, whereas SMI-32-ir is moderate across the whole nucleus, The substantia nigra is characterized by complementary patterns of high neuropil CB- and SMI-32-ir in pars reticulata (SNr and high CR-ir in pars compacta (SNc) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The compartmentalization of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32 in the human basal ganglia, in particular in the striatum and pallidum, delimits anatomofunctional territories that are of significance for functional imaging studies and target selection in stereotactic neurosurgery.

Here, we review the neural signatures of attention throughout the brain, their theoretical benefits for visual processing, and their experimental correlations with behavioral performance. We discuss the importance of measuring cue benefits as a way to distinguish between impairments on an attention task, which may instead be visual or motor impairments, and true attentional deficits. We examine evidence for various areas proposed as sources of attentional modulation within the brain, with a focus on the prefrontal cortex.

If development is tied to time since conception, preterm infants should match the developmental trajectories of fullterm infants when plotted in postterm age. By contrast, if development is influenced by visual experience, preterm and fullterm infants should match when plotted in postnatal age. Luminance (light/dark) and chromatic (red/green) contrast sensitivities (CS) were measured in 25 preterm (born, on average, 6.6 weeks early) and 77 fullterm infants, between 1 and 6 months postterm. In the first few months, luminance CS was found to be predicted by postterm age, suggesting that preprogrammed development is sufficient to account for luminance CS. By contrast, chromatic CS exceeded that predicted by postterm age, which suggests that time since birth confers a bene fit on chromatic CS. The preterms' 6.6 weeks of additional time since birth is roughly equivalent to 3.7 weeks of development in chromatic CS. In sum, these results suggest that chromatic CS is more influenced by early postnatal visual experience than luminance CS, which may have implications for development of parvocellular and magnocellular pathways.","[Bosworth, Rain G.; Dobkins, Karen R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego","Bosworth, RG (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","rain@ucsd.edu; kdobkins@ucsd.edu","Bosworth, Rain/W-3224-2019","Bosworth, Rain/0000-0001-9645-8371","NIH [R01-EY12153, R01-EY19035]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","We would like to thank Fiona Yeh and Marie Chuldzhyan for assistance with data collection and Vanitha Sampath and Jeff Judson for assistance in programming.

This antibody labels primarily the cell body and dendrites of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III, V, and VI. Neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons were prominent in 20 visual cortical areas (areas 17, 18, 19, 20a, 20b, 21a, 21b, and 7; posteromedial lateral, posterolateral lateral, anteromedial lateral, anterolateral lateral, dorsal lateral, ventral lateral, and posterior suprasylvian areas; anterior ectosylvian, the splenial, the cingulate, and insular visual areas; and the anterolateral gyrus area). In addition, we have also found strong immunopositive cells in the A laminae of the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and in the medial interlaminar nucleus, but no immunoreactive cells were present in the parvocellular C (1-3) laminae of the dLGN, in the ventral part of the LGN and in the perigeniculate nucleus. This SMI-32 antibody against neurofilament protein revealed a characteristic pattern of immunostaining in each visual area. The size, shape, intensity, and density of neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons and their dendritic arborization differed substantially across all visual areas. Moreover, it was also obvious that several visual areas showed differences in laminar distribution and that such profiles may be used to delineate various cortical areas. Therefore, the expression of neurofilament protein can be used as a specific marker to define areal patterns and topographic boundaries in the cat visual system.

It is now emerging that the difficulties in understanding the importance of the mammillary bodies for memory might stem from the tradition of treating the mammillary bodies as a single structure with a single function. This review will dissect the mammillary bodies and show how their component nuclei might have multiple functions that, nevertheless, are coordinated to give the impression of a unitary function.","Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3YG, S Glam, Wales","Cardiff University","Vann, SD (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, POB 901, Cardiff CF10 3YG, S Glam, Wales.",,"Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010","Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773; Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308",,,,,136,211,217,0,27,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","1471-0048",,,"NAT REV NEUROSCI","Nat.
