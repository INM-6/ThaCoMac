It is found that the apical dendrites of medium-sized and large pyramidal cells in layer V group together to form clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of about 56 mum. As these clusters ascend, the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer II/III are added to them. The thinner apical dendrites of the smaller pyramidal cells in layer VIa also form groups that are referred to as bundles. These bundles ascend, into layer IV independent of the clusters, and their arrangement suggests that the bundles are formed so that the apical dendrites of the layer VIa pyramids can pass between the groups of cell bodies of the layer V neurons. It is proposed that the clusters formed from the apical dendrites of the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells represent the axes of vertical modules of pyramidal cells, which represent the basic neuronal aggregates within area 17 of cat visual cortex. And it is suggested that these modules can be recruited in various combinations, most obviously by the excitation provided by the thalamic inputs, to form the functional columns, such as the ones that are concerned with eye preference and orientation. Based upon the distribution of the dendritic clusters, the pyramidal cell modules would have diameters of 56 mum, and since they are considered to extend through the depth of the cortex, each one would contain some 203 neurons. The striate cortex of one hemisphere contains 160,000 of these modules, which is about the same as the number of X-cells projecting to one hemisphere from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and twice the number of X- or beta-ganglion cells in the retina. The form of the pyramidal cell modules in cat striate cortex is compared to those present in monkey striate cortex, in which the similar modules are about 10 times more numerous, but only 31 mum in diameter (Peters and Sethares, 1991a).",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-2; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; APICAL DENDRITES,

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.",alpha; oscillations; intracranial EEG; laminar; thalamocortical; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; LAMINAR PROFILE; GAMMA; PHASE; EEG; CORTEX; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; MONKEY,

Using positron emission tomography and statistical parametric mapping, we compared the glucose metabolic pattern obtained in this subcortical dementia to that observed in elderly healthy controls and in Alzheimer's disease, the prototype of cortical dementia. Progressive supranuclear palsy was characterized by a relative decrease of metabolism in anterior cingulate, adjacent supplementary motor area, precentral cortex, middle prefrontal cortex, midbrain tegmentum, globus pallidus, and ventrolateral and dorsomedial nuclei of thalamus. The data in progressive supranuclear palsy highlight predominant metabolic impairment in brain structures engaged in response selection, in attention for action, and in motor networks.

The pain was characterized as burning or icelike, and was associated with impairment of pin and temperature appreciation. Computed tomographic scanning showed that the common area of involvement in all cases was the white matter deep to both the caudal insula and the opercular region of the posterior parietal cortex. We suggest that disruption of the interconnections between these cerebral cortical areas (including the second somatosensory representation, SII) and the thalamus, particularly the intralaminar and ventroposterior nuclei, may be responsible for producing a thalamocortical disconnection syndrome with spontaneous pain as its clinical manifestation.",nan; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; THALAMIC AFFERENTS; POSTERIOR; ORGANIZATION,

While it is known that primates have a complex array of 10 or more somatosensory areas that contribute to the analysis of sensory information from the hand, less is known about what cortical areas are involved in processing information from receptors of the tongue and teeth. The tongue contains taste receptors, as well as mechanoreceptors. Afferents from taste receptors and mechanoreceptors of the tongue access different ascending systems in the brainstem. However, it is uncertain how these two sources of information are processed in cortex. Here the parts of somatosensory areas 3b, 3a, and presumptive 1 that represent the mechanoreceptors of the teeth and tongue are identified, and evidence is presented that the representations of the tongue also get information from the taste nucleus of the thalamus, VPMpc. As areas 3b, 3a, and 1 project to other areas of somatosensory cortex, and those areas to additional areas, some or all of the currently defined somatosensory areas of cortex may be involved in processing gustatory, as well as tactile, information from the tongue and thus have a role in the biologically important function of evaluating food in the mouth.

He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' Swiss period (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called supplementary motor area was rather a supramotor area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether [C-11]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylamino-methyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ([C-11]DASB) binding to the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) in the rhesus monkey and rat brain decreased after a pharmacologically-induced increase in the interstitial serotonin (5HT) concentration. Three rhesus monkeys were given repeated single boluses of [C-11]DASB in sequential positron emission tomography (PET) experiments. Rats were given the tracer as a bolus dose plus a constant infusion. In vivo binding in both models was studied before and after presumably having increased interstitial 5HT concentrations using tranylcypromine (TCP), which inhibits the enzyme (monoamine oxidase, MAO), that degrades 5HT. The rat brain tissue was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the proportion of the PET signal comprising unchanged [C-11]DASB. The binding of [C-11]DASB in the thalamus decreased in both rhesus monkeys and rats after TCP administration. The possibility of using [C-11]DASB as a tool for monitoring changes in endogenous serotonin concentrations merits further investigation.",endogenous serotonin; positron emission tomography (PET); in vivo binding; [C-11]DASB; brain; IN-VIVO BINDING; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; HUMAN BRAIN; ENDOGENOUS SEROTONIN; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; CONTINUOUS-INFUSION; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; PET SCANNER; TRANSPORTER,

II. Effect of muscimol inactivation of the caudal fastigial nucleus,"The medioposterior cerebellum [vermian lobules VI and VII and caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN)] is known to play a major role in the control of saccadic gaze shifts toward a visual target. To determine the relative contribution of the cFN efferent pathways to the brainstem reticular formation and to the superior colliculus (SC), we recorded in the head-unrestrained cat the effects of cFN unilateral inactivation on gaze shifts evoked by electrical microstimulation of the deeper SC layers. Gaze shifts evoked after muscimol injection still exhibited the typical qualitative features of normal saccadic gaze shifts. Nevertheless, consistent modifications in amplitude and latency were observed. For ipsiversive movements (evoked by the SC contralateral to the inactivated cFN), these changes depended on the locus of stimulation on the motor map: for the anterior 2/3 of the SC, amplitude increased and latency tended to decrease; for the posterior 1/3 of the SC, amplitude decreased and latency increased. For the contraversive direction, amplitude moderately decreased and latency tended to increase for all but the caudal-most stimulated SC site. These modifications of SC-evoked gaze shifts during cFN inactivation differed from the ipsiversive hypermetria/contraversive hypometria pattern observed for visually triggered gaze shifts recorded during the same recording sessions. We conclude that (i) the topographical organization of gaze shift amplitude in the deeper SC layers is influenced by the cerebellum and is either severely distorted or demonstrates an amplitude reduction during inactivation of the contralateral or ipsilateral cFN, respectively; (ii) gaze shifts evoked by SC microstimulation and visually triggered gaze shifts either rely on distinct cerebellar-dependent control processes or differ by the location of the caudal-most active SC population. We present a functional scheme providing several predictions regarding the modulatory influence of the cerebellum on SC neuronal activities and on the topographical organization of fastigial-SC projections.",cerebellum; dysmetria; eye movement; saccade; tectum; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; THALAMIC SUPRAGENICULATE NUCLEUS; PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; CEREBELLAR VERMIS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; OCULOMOTOR REGION; PURKINJE-CELLS; PREPOSITUS-HYPOGLOSSI; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS,

Intense staining for both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was observed in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons in this nucleus. In comparison to GluR1, less intense staining for GluR2/3 was observed in the cell bodies and processes. NMDAR1 immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies and large numbers of small diameter dendrites. Light staining was observed in cell bodies with mGluR1a and no staining was observed on cell bodies with mGluR5. The neuropil, however, contained many processes that were labeled for mGluR1a or mGluR5. Electron microscopy showed that label was present in cytoplasmic locations in cell bodies and dendrites, in addition to components of the synaptic region, in sections stained for GluR1, GluR2/3 and NMDAR1. In contrast, very lightly labeled or unlabeled cell bodies but labeled dendrites and axon terminals, was observed in sections stained for mGluR1a and mGluR5. In addition to neural processes, occasional astrocytic processes were also labeled for mGluR5. Of the immunogold particles that were associated with components of the synaptic region, label for ionotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present on postsynaptic densities, whilst that for metabotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present in a perisynaptic location. The ratio of GluR1/GluR2 messenger RNAs has been reported to increase in the aged hippocampus (PAGLIUSI, S. R., GERRARD, P., ABDALLAH, M., TALABOT, D. & CATSICAS, S. (1994) Neuroscience 61, 429-433.), and it is possible that a similar change in the ratio of GluR1 and GluR2 may occur in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus with age. It is postulated that this could result an increase in calcium permeability via AMPA receptors, and an enhancement of excitatory transmission in this nucleus.",nan; PARAFASCICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MESSENGER-RNA; GLUR1 SUBUNIT,

These precerebellar nuclei, in turn, receive a feedback projection from the cerebellar nuclei, which mostly originate in the lateral nucleus (LN). It has been suggested that the feedback projection from the LN partially uses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a transmitter. We tested this hypothesis by using a combination of anterograde tracing (biotinylated dextran amine injection into the LN) and postembedding GABA and glutamate immunogold histochemistry. The pattern of labeling in the PN and the NRTP was compared with that of cerebellonuclear terminals in two other target structures, the parvocellular part of the nucleus ruber (RNp) and the ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamus (VM/VL). The projection to the inferior olive (IO), which is known to be predominantly GABAergic, served as a control. A quantitative analysis of the synaptic terminals labeled by the tracer within the PN, the NRTP, and the VL/VM revealed no GABA immunoreactivity. Only one clearly labeled terminal was found in the RNp. In contrast, 72% of the terminals in the IO were clearly GABA immunoreactive, confirming the reliability of our staining protocol. Correspondingly, glutamate immunohistochemistry labeled the majority of the cerebellonuclear terminals in the PN (88%), the NRTP (90%), the RNp (93%), and the VM/VL (63%) but labeled only 5% in the IO. These data do not support a role for GABAergic inhibition either in the feedback systems from the LN to the PN and the NRTP or within the projections to the RNp and the VM/VL.

Using [C-11](R)PKI1195, a sensitive in vivo marker of glial cell activation, and PET, we provide first evidence that limb denervation induces a trans-synaptic increase in [C-11](R)-PKI1195 binding in the human thalamus but not somatosensory cortex: these brain structures appeared morphologically normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity. Our findings support the view that long-term rearrangement of cortical representational maps is significantly determined within the thalamus.

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception, often by making the sound seem louder, the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review, we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g., what circuits underlie multisensory convergence), and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g., what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact, it seems that the question is no longer whether low level, putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences, but how.

In turn, the posterior parietal areas send projections to the frontal primary motor and premotor areas. This cortical pathway is hypothesized to be involved in the transformation of a visual input into the appropriate motor output. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the entire brain to determine the patterns of activation that occurred while subjects performed a visually guided motor task. In nine human subjects, fMRI data were acquired on a 4-T whole-body MR system equipped with a head gradient coil and a birdcage RF coil using a T-2*-weighted EPI sequence. Functional activation was determined for three different tasks: (1) a visuomotor task consisting of moving a cursor on a screen with a joystick in relation to various targets, (2) a hand movement task consisting of moving the joystick without visual input, and (3) a eye movement task consisting of moving the eyes alone without visual input. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-based activation maps of each subject were generated using period cross-correlation statistics. Subsequently, each subject's brain was normalized to Talairach coordinates, and the individual maps were compared on a pixel by pixel basis. Significantly activated pixels common to at least four out of six subjects were retained to construct the final functional image. The pattern of activation during visually guided movements was consistent with the flow of information from striate and extrastriate visual areas, to the posterior parietal complex, and then to frontal motor areas. The extensive activation of this network and the reproducibility among subjects is consistent with a role for the dorsal stream in transforming visual information into motor behavior. Also extensively activated were the medial and lateral cerebellar structures, implicating the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway in visually guided movements. Thalamic activation, particularly of the pulvinar, suggests that this nucleus is an important subcortical target of the dorsal stream.

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images providing a novel and accurate way of measuring very fine and local functional differences.

In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored. Methodology: We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of mu-opioid receptors. Principal Findings: In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with mu-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[C-11] methyl] buprenorphine ([C-11]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition. Conclusions: Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research.",nan; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DRUG DISCOVERY; CONTRAST AGENT; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FMRI; BOLD; PHARMACOKINETICS; ACTIVATION; MACAQUES; MONKEYS,

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

It has long been assumed that cone opponent ganglion cells project to the parvocellular layers of the geniculate. Here, we examine the role of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets. The result calls into question the traditional notion that all colour information passes through the parvocellular division of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway in primates.",colour vision; Callithrix jacchus; magnocellular; parvocellular; koniocellular; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE GANGLION-CELLS; VISUAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; RELAY; TERMINATIONS; ORGANIZATION; SENSITIVITY; RETINA,

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques.",Acetylcholine; Nicotinic receptor; Muscarinic receptor; Behavioral flexibility; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION; TRANSIENT INACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS,

In addition, the LS area is related to all three components of the ocular near response, i.e. lens accommodation, pupillary constriction, and ocular convergence: microstimulation in this area evoked these intra- and extraocular movements, and neuronal discharges associated with these movements were also found. Anatomical pathways, direct and indirect, from this area to premotor nuclei in the brainstem are known to exist. The present paper reviews studies useful for assessing the functional roles played by the LS area in triggering and modulating component movements in the ocular near response.",EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL CORTICAL AREA; EYE MOVEMENT; OCULAR NEAR RESPONSE; LENS ACCOMMODATION; VERGENCE EYE MOVEMENT; CAT; PUPILLARY CONSTRICTION; CORTICAL AREAS MT; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; CLARE-BISHOP AREA; OPTICALLY-INDUCED CHANGES; ADJACENT THALAMIC NUCLEI; PUPILLARY LIGHT REFLEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; LENS ACCOMMODATION; MACAQUE MONKEY,

Some studies have suggested that functional and structural impairments in the default mode network may play a role in explaining these disorders. In contrast, others have proposed that dysfunctions in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit involving striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus may be the main underlying mechanism. Here, we provide the first report of structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting the nodes of the mesocircuit and the default mode network in 8 patients with DOC. We found evidence of significant damage to subcortico-cortical and cortico-cortical fibers, which were more severe in vegetative state patients and correlated with clinical severity as determined by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. In contrast, fiber tracts interconnecting subcortical nodes were not significantly impaired. Lastly, we found significant damage in all fiber tracts connecting the precuneus with cortical and subcortical areas. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the default mode network and most importantly the precuneus - and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the neural basis of the DOC.

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

We injected rabies into the primary motor cortex (M1) or into Area 46 of cebus monkeys. A 4-day survival time was long enough to allow transport of rabies from the injection site to 'third-order' neurons in the basal ganglia. After either MI or Area 46 injections, third-order neurons were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). In each of these nuclei, the third-order neurons that innervate M1 were spatially separated from those that innervate Area 46. Thus, distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits innervate M1 and Area 46. Next, we injected a conventional tracer into M1 to define its terminations in the putamen and STN. We found that the regions of the putamen and STN that receive input from M1 are the same as those that contain third-order neurons after M1 injections of virus. On the other hand, virus injections into M1 also labeled a relatively dense group of third-order neurons in a region of the ventral putamen that is not innervated by M1. This region of the putamen is the target of efferents from the amygdala. Thus, the ventral putamen may provide a route for the limbic system to influence motor output. Overall, our results indicate that basal ganglia circuits with the cerebral cortex can be characterized by both open- and closed-loop macro-architectures.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PRIMATE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY,

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that testosterone increases neural activity in the amygdala. To investigate whether this could be due to altered regulation of amygdala functioning which is thought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, we studied the effects of exogenous testosterone on the interaction between the amygdala and other brain regions. Healthy middle-aged women received a single nasal testosterone dose in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover manner, and performed an emotional face matching task while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI. The results show that testosterone rapidly reduced functional coupling of the amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex, and enhanced amygdala coupling with the thalamus. This suggests that testosterone may reduce the regulatory control over the amygdala, or that testosterone shifts amygdala output away from the orbitofrontal cortex towards the thalamus. Testosterone also reduced functional coupling with the contralateral amygdala. Because interhemispheric amygdala coupling is lower in men than in women, this result suggests that circulating testosterone may contribute to this sexual dimorphism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly worth emphasizing is the intricate spatial configuration and striking morphometric heterogeneity of individual axons even within the same system of connections. A short section touches on patterns of axonal trajectories in the distal, preterminal few millimeters. Emphasis is on studies in nonhuman primates from about 1983 to present, with non-viral tracers and 2-D reconstruction (i.e., compressed z-axis) in the early visual cortical pathway.

Little is known about the impact of amblyopia on the white matter within the visual system. We studied the properties of six major visual white-matter pathways in a group of adults with amblyopia (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 10) using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography. While we did not find significant differences in diffusion properties in cortico-cortical pathways, patients with amblyopia exhibited increased mean diffusivity in thalamo-cortical visual pathways.

Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by reinnervation of denervated targets by regenerating injured axons or by collateral branching Of undamaged axons, and remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of adequate tat-get reinnervation; however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, Such as neuropathic pain and hyperreflexia. After axotomy, neurons shift from a transmitter to a regenerative phenotype, activating molecular pathways that promote neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Peripheral nerve injuries also induce a cascade of events, at the Molecular, cellular, and system levels, initiated by the injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, thalamus, and brain cortex. Mechanisms involved in these changes include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of sensory and motor central maps. An important direction for research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, and are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying positive adaptive changes that improve functional recovery and also reducing undesirable effects.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; ADULT MACAQUE MONKEYS; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; RAT SPINAL-CORD; DENDRITIC ARBORIZATION PATTERNS; REORGANIZATION FOLLOWING MOTOR; GATED SODIUM-CHANNELS; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; PERIPHERAL-NERVE,

In the tectorotundal system, neurons of the stratum griseum centrale (SGC) of the optic tectum send their axons bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt). In transit to the Rt, the axons of the SGC neurons collateralize in the nuclei posteroventralis thalami (PV), subpretectalis (SP), and interstitiopretectosubpretectalis (IPS) of the tectothalamic tract (TT). The current study used birthdating and pathway-tracing methods to investigate the neurogenesis and time course of neuronal connections of the tectorotundal pathway in chicks during embryogenesis. By using tritiated thymidine autoradiography, we observed that the SGC neurons of the tectum were generated by embryonic days 3.0-5.5 (E3.0-E5.5), the Rt by E3.5-E5.0, and the nuclei of TT by E3.5-4.5. To trace the tectorotundal pathway, we injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into the tectum, and the CTb-like immunoreactivity was examined. By E4.5-E5.5, some CTb-like immunoreactive (CTb-LI) axons terminated in the ipsilateral SP/IPS. By E6.0-E6.5, CTb-LI axon bundles were seen ipsilaterally in the TT. Increased numbers of labeled axons were seen terminating in the SP/IPS. By E7.0-E7.5, heavily labeled axons in the TT were observed with diffuse terminals in areas ventral to the presumptive Rt and PV. By E7.5-E8.0, the tectal axons innervated the ipsilateral Rt, in which some of the collaterals crossed the midline to the contralateral diencephalon. The crossed tectorotundal projection was seen first by E8.0-E8.5. Also, during this stage, a few CTb-LI collaterals terminated in the contralateral SP/IPS. Between E10 and. E13, the pattern of bilateral tectorotundal projections became more regionalized, whereas labeling continued to increase in the SP/IPS. At E16, the labeling pattern of all tectorecipient structures resembled that of the hatchling. The current study revealed the temporal order of development of the tectorotundal pathway during embryogenesis. The SGC cells first innervate ipsilaterally the SP/IPS and then the Rt/PV. The schedule of the crossed tectorotundal connections coincides with the schedule of tectal projections onto the contralateral intrinsic nuclei of the TT. We conclude that E8.0 (+/-E0.5) is a critical stage for the development of the tectofugal pathway. Moreover, the current study provides important insights into the relative ontogeny of the mammalian tectofugal pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:115-132, 2000.

Many extrinsic cortical connections also form columnar terminations, but less is known about their fine organization. Results from intracellular injections of neighboring neurons (in rats: Johnson et al., 2000) suggest that even neurons within a common domain may have non-stereotyped projection patterns, with only partial overlap of terminal arbors. The issue of non-stereotyped projections at the columnar level is further considered by analysis of V1 axons terminating in primate area MT/V5 (an early visual area), and of an axon from temporal cortex terminating in area 7b (a higher cortical area). Both these axons have multiple non-uniform arbors. The implication is that each arbor recruits different numbers and possibly different combinations of postsynaptic elements. While more data are needed concerning convergence of connectional systems, and the actual identity and numbers of postsynaptic targets, the distributed spatial and laminar patterns do not evoke a repetitive uniformity, but rather a columnar substructure and the combinatoric possibilities of the 3-dimensional cortical organization.",nan; MACAQUE MONKEY; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL CELL; CORTICAL AREAS; V1; PROJECTIONS; MORPHOLOGY; AXON; MT,

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds).",burst; EEG; modelling; spike patterns; NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; THALAMIC NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FIRE NEURONS; IN-VITRO; OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPSES,

In the striatum, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the rostroventral half of the putamen and is characterized by enhanced matriceal PV and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (4). The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the caudate nucleus (Cd) and rostral putamen (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal CB-ir. The third and fourth territories M and T4) comprise rostroventral parts of Cd and PuT characterized by complementary patch/matrix distributions of CB- and CR-ir, and the accumbens nucleus (Acb), respectively. The latter is separated into lateral (prominently enhanced in CB-ir) and medial (prominently enhanced in CR-ir) subdivisions. In the pallidum, parallel gradients also delimit four territories, T1 in the caudal half of external (GPe) and internal (GPi) divisions, characterized by enhanced PV- and SMI-32-ir; T2 in their rostral half, characterized by enhanced CB-ir; and T3 and T4 in their rostroventral pole and in the subpallidal area, respectively, both expressing CB- and CR-ir but with different intensities. The subthalamic nucleus (STh) shows contrasting patterns of dense PV-ir (sparing only the most medial part) and low CB-ir. Expression of CR-ir is relatively low, except in the medial, low PV-ir, part of the nucleus, whereas SMI-32-ir is moderate across the whole nucleus, The substantia nigra is characterized by complementary patterns of high neuropil CB- and SMI-32-ir in pars reticulata (SNr and high CR-ir in pars compacta (SNc) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The compartmentalization of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32 in the human basal ganglia, in particular in the striatum and pallidum, delimits anatomofunctional territories that are of significance for functional imaging studies and target selection in stereotactic neurosurgery.

Noting their connections with the basal ganglia, the locomotor disturbances that occur following lesions of the PPN or cMRF, and the encouraging results of PPN deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, both the PPN and cMRF have been linked to motor control. In order to determine the existence of and characterize vestibular responses in the PPN and cMRF, we recorded single neurons from both structures during vertical and horizontal rotation, translation, and visual pursuit stimuli. The majority of PPN cells (72.5%) were vestibular-only (VO) cells that responded exclusively to rotation and translation stimuli but not visual pursuit. Visual pursuit responses were much more prevalent in the cMRF (57.1%) though close to half of cMRF cells were VO cells (41.1%). Directional preferences also differed between the PPN, which was preferentially modulated during nose-down pitch, and cMRF, which was preferentially modulated during ipsilateral yaw rotation. Finally, amplitude responses were similar between the PPN and cMRF during rotation and pursuit stimuli, but PPN responses to translation were of higher amplitude than cMRF responses. Taken together with their connections to the vestibular circuit, these results implicate the PPN and cMRF in the processing of vestibular stimuli and suggest important roles for both in responding to motion perturbations like falls and turns.

It is now clear that higher primates have four strip-like representations of skin and muscle receptors corresponding to areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2 of anterior parietal cortex. Areas 3 b and 1 receive cutaneous information from the ventroposterior nucleus, while a ventroposterior superior nucleus provides areas 3 a and 2 with information from muscle receptors. Area 3 b is the homolog of S-I in prosimians and non-primates and it provides most of the activating cutaneous inputs to areas 1 and 2. Most of the further processing that allows tactile recognition of objects involves somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus, where both S-II and the parietal ventral area (PV) receive activating inputs from areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2. S-II also projects to PV and to a parietal rostral area where further connections with the amygdala and hippocampus may occur to allow the formation of tactile memories. Areas of anterior parietal cortex also project to posterior parietal cortex, where regions of cortex are largely somatosensory, but the functional subdivisions remain uncertain.

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer, leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN, almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast, following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN, labeled cells were found in both tiers, with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus, layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN: an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers.",VISUAL CORTEX; AREA 17; PARALLEL PATHWAYS; CORTICOTHALAMIC; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; AREA 17; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT,YES

Recently, molecular biological techniques have enabled us to find rare types of genes expressed in specific neocortical areas. We previously reported occ1 gene as preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex (V1), using the differential display method. Here, by differential display, we found selective and strong expression of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene, in higher-order association areas. In V1, RBP mRNA was expressed only in the superficial part of layer II, but its expression increased, involving deeper layers, along the visual pathway. In visual association areas such as TE, RBP mRNA was strongly expressed in both supra- and infragranular layers. In primary auditory and somatosensory areas, as in V1, RBP expression was low, and restricted to the upper part of the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of RBP expression is in marked contrast with that of occ1; and in early visual areas where both genes are expressed, these occur in distinct sublayers within the supragranular layers. In neonatal monkeys, the area-specific expression pattern of RBP was less distinct, suggesting that the characteristic expression of RBP in higher-order association areas is mainly established postnatally.",area formation; cortical layer; differential display; macaque monkey; RBP; thalamic projection; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VITAMIN-A-DEFICIENCY; ACID RECEPTOR-ALPHA; SEPTAL CELL-LINE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX,

Using regional cerebral blood flow and positron emission tomography we previously confirmed frequency-selective cortical responses to 40-Hz tones in auditory primary cortices and concomitant bilateral activation of the cerebellar hemispheres. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we estimated the influence of 40-Hz auditory stimulation on the coupling between auditory cortex and superior temporal sulcus (STS) and Crus II, using a dynamic causal model of the interactions between medial geniculate nuclei, auditory superior temporal gyrus (STG)/STS, and the cerebellar Crus II auditory region. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 40-Hz-selective responses in the cerebellar Crus II auditory region could be explained by frequency-specific enabling of interactions in the auditory cortico-cerebellar-thalamic loop. Our model comparison results suggest that input from auditory STG/STS to cerebellum is enhanced selectively at gamma-band frequencies around 40 Hz.",nan; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; MAGNETIC-FIELD; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; AREAS; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; HUMANS,

This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.

Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Healthy controls and migraineurs were categorized according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Photophobia was measured under full-field illumination using electromyography in response to narrowband lights spanning the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra. Migraineurs were tested during their interictal headache-free period. Melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil responses quantified intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cell (ipRGC) function. Results A model combining the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra best described photophobia thresholds in controls and migraineurs; melanopsin contributions were similar to 1.5x greater than cone luminance. In the illumination range causing photophobia; migraineurs had lower photophobia thresholds (similar to 0.55 log units; p < 0.001) and higher post-illumination pupil response amplitudes (p = 0.03) than controls. Conclusion Photophobia is driven by melanopsin and cone luminance inputs to the cortex via the retino-thalamocortical pathway. In migraineurs; lower photophobia thresholds reflect hypersensitivity of ipRGC and cone luminance pathways; with the larger and prolonged post-illumination pupil response amplitude indicative of a supranormal melanopsin response.

oxidase patches: a new cytoarchitectonic feature of monkey visual cortex,In normal macaque monkeys a histochemical stain for cytochrome oxidase activity revealed a striking pattern of regularly spaced patches in primary visual striate area  V cortex The patches were most obvious in layers II and III but also in layers I IV b V and VI only in layers IV c and IV a were they absent The patches were oval shaped about  by  pm and aligned into rows spaced about  pm apart Along each row a patch was located about every  pm often patches in neighbouring rows were aligned creating a square array T heir density was about one patch per  mm  by  pm in opercular cortex The patches were also labelled preferentially by stains for lactate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase acetylcholinesterase AChE and myelin In V a coarser pattern of broad parallel stripes labelled by cytochrome oxidase lactate dehydrogenase and AChE was present The cytochrome oxidase patches were absent in non-prim ate species like the cat mink tree shrew mouse rat rabbit and ground squirrel However they were present in all prim ate species examined including the rhesus cynomolgus owl and squirrel monkey baboon bushbaby and hum an While more species should be tested it appears that the patches are a cytoarchitectonic feature unique to prim ate visual cortex In the owl monkey patches of anterogradely transported horseradish peroxidase HRP were found in layers IV ca III and II after injection of the tracer into the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn They coincided exactly with the position of patches in adjacent sections processed for cytochrome oxidase A similar result was obtained in the macaque except that patches were not present in layer IV ca These experiments established that the cytochrome oxidase patches receive a direct patchy projection from the lateral geniculate body However retrogradely filled layer VI cells in the owl monkey bore no regular relation to the patches In the macaque the honeycomb of geniculate terminals in layer IV a matched a similar honeycomb pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining In the Nissl stain three sublayers in layer IV a were identified the honeycomb was located in layer IV ap In V in the owl monkey the parallel stripes of enhanced cytochrome oxidase activity received a direct projection from lgn or pulvinar In the macaque after intraocular injection of Hproline the rows of patches in layers II and III lay in register with ocular dominance columns seen by transneuronal radioautography in layer IV c In another macaque one eye was removed and the cortex stained for cytochrome oxidase AChE and Nissl substance after six months survival In layer IV c light and dark bands corresponding to the ocular dominance columns were visible surprisingly the dark cytochrome oxidase bands matched the light AChE and Nissl bands The set of bands belonging to the missing eye was determined by examining cytochrome oxidase staining and proline radioautographs in another macaque that sustained severe eye injury by Hproline injection In striate cortex bands of radioactive label from the injured eye matched ocular dominance columns appearing more lightly stained by cytochrome oxidase In the macaque tested six months after enucleation in every other row the cytochrome oxidase patches appeared pale and shrunken These lighter rows fit into precise register with the lighter ocular dominance columns in layer IV c confirming the correspondence between rows of patches and ocular dominance columns demonstrated by proline injection AChE staining of patches was similarly affected by eye removal The effect of visual deprivation upon cytochrome oxidase staining was tested in two monocularly sutured macaques In the lgn no effect was detected In visual cortex wide light columns alternating with thin dark columns were observed in layer IV In one m acaque the ocular dominance columns were labelled independently by H R P injection into a deprived lgn lamina The H R P labelled ocular dominance columns fit within the pale cytochrome oxidase columns this establishes that monocular deprivation causes a relatively greater loss of enzyme activity in ocular dom inance columns belonging to the closed eye However there was also loss of cytochrome oxidase staining along the borders of the normal eye dominance columns indicating that ocular dominance columns in layer IV are subdivided into core zones flanked by border strips that are susceptible to loss of cytochrome oxidase activity with suture of either eye The core zones are the same width as the rows of cytochrome oxidase patches and correspond to the dark bands seen in Liesegang stains of normal macaque striate cortex In two adult cats the effect of monocular lid suture at  d old was assessed no effect upon cytochrome oxidase staining in lgn or cortex was observed The optic disc representation in visual cortex was studied by -deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining after eye removal or lid suture in m acaque monkeys It appeared as a pale oval  times longer than the optic disc a distortion probably required to m aintain overall isotrophy in magnification factor Patches were present in the disc representation although ocular dominance columns are absent they appeared rounder and more widely separated In the temporal cresent patches were also present They were larger rounder and less densely spaced than patches in binocular cortex Deoxyglucose mapping in a macaque monkey monocularly stimulated with a display of parallel black and white stripes of irregular width and spacing rotated through all orientations has resulted in patches in the upper layers over ocular dominance columns corresponding to the open eye These patches match cytochrome oxidase patches situated in every other row thus suggesting that cells located in cytochrome oxidase patches respond to all orientations of stimulus Macaques binocularly stimulated with vertical or horizontal stripes show a complicated pattern of deoxyglucose uptake overlapping extensively with the pattern of cytochrome oxidase patches In one monkey the right eye was removed and  d later the animal was stimulated with vertical stripes Deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining combined in single tissue sections each revealed a matching pattern of ocular dominance columns in layer IV In the upper layers dots of radioautographic label were present matching cytochrome oxidase patches in alternate rows In foetal monkeys at E- the laminar pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining in visual cortex was remarkable for a prominent wide band of intense activity in layer IV b and upper IV ca absent in mature macaques In tangential section patches were visible in layers II III and in layer IV b -IV ca which indicates that patches form in monkey visual cortex before birth The functional significance of the patches remains uncertain It has been suggested that the visual field is analysed in visual cortex by small modules containing several hypercolumns of each stimulus variable The cytochrome oxidase patches may constitute the anatomical correlate of these proposed modules,,

One circuit mediates motor function; another eye movements; and three of the circuits mediate cognitive; emotional; and motivational processes. The circuits serve as organizational axes integrating related information from widespread areas of the brain and mediating diverse behaviors. This review describes the anatomy of the circuits and the major transmitters present within the circuits. Circuit-specific behaviors (those that appear to be mediated exclusively by circuit structures) and circuit-related behaviors (those that involve both circuit and noncircuit structures) are discussed. Drugs that alter behavior through effects on the circuits are presented. The three circuits that are most relevant to understanding behavior are emphasized.,OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATOPALLIDAL SYSTEM; PARALLEL ORGANIZATION; THALAMIC INFARCTION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SECONDARY MANIA,

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years; rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models; a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models; cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover; some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models; a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans; the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus; ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments; they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore; we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys; the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter; a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection; the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models; the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP; in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore; the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months; such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently; brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore; the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.,Animal model; Brain imaging; Plasticity; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; nan,

Selection and replication of neurovirulent SIV.,To investigate the viral and host factors that contribute to neurological disease nine macaques were intravenously co-inoculated with SIVDeltaB a primary isolate of SIV consisting of at least  different genotypes and SIVE-Fr a neurovirulent recombinant clone CD cell counts and antigenemia were measured throughout infection The SIV env V region was amplified from brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA to compare the genotypes present in brain and blood Seven of the  macaques  developed typical SIV-associated neurological lesions classified as severe  macaques moderate  macaques or mild  macaque with a mean time to euthanasia of  months Macaques with severe neurological lesions progressed more rapidly with a mean time to euthanasia of - months SIVE-Fr was detected in brain homogenates from all four macaques with severe encephalitis and in three of the four SIVE-Fr was the only genotype identified in the central nervous system Macaques with less severe or no neurological lesions usually had one of various genotypes of SIVDeltaB in brain A variety of genotypes of SIVDeltaB and SIVE-Fr were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells throughout infection Macaques with severe neurological lesions had the most precipitous declines in CD cell counts the highest levels of antigenemia and the greatest expression of viral RNA and protein in the central nervous system Macaca nemestrina were more likely to develop severe neurological lesions than M mulatta or M fascicularis P   This study demonstrated that neurovirulent strains within the virus swarm can selectively enter and become established in the central nervous system and that the neurological lesions that develop are correlated with the development of host immunosuppression The species differences in severity of neurological lesions seen in this study suggest that host factors are also important in determining the outcome of lentiviral infection,,

Activity Encoding Visual Versus Motor Signal,We collected single-neuron activity from the mediodorsal MD nucleus of the thalamus examined the information that was represented by task-related activity during performance of a spatial working memory task and compared the present results with those obtained in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC We used two oculomotor delayed-response ODR tasks In the ordinary ODR task monkeys were required to make a memory-guided saccade to the location where a visual cue had been presented  s previously whereas in the rotatory ODR task they were required to make a memory-guided saccade  clockwise from the cue direction By comparing the best directions of the same task-related activity between the two tasks we could determine whether this activity represented the cue location or the saccade direction All cue-period activity represented the cue location In contrast  of delay-period activity represented the cue location and  represented the saccade direction Almost all response-period activity represented the saccade direction These results indicate that task-related MD activity represents either visual or motor information suggesting that the MD participates in sensory-to-motor information processing However a greater proportion of delay- and response-period activities represented the saccade direction in the MD than in the DLPFC indicating that more MD neurons participate in prospective information processing than DLPFC neurons These results suggest that although functional interactions between the MD and DLPFC are crucial to cognitive functions such as working memory there is a difference in how the MD and DLPFC participate in these functions,,

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools; the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan); which used different nomenclatures. In fact; the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic; rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique; comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region; we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures; and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region; a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus'; the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II); the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions; rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar; pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense; in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape; strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory; primarily dentate; also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei; the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape; its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces; can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e'; object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory; in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped; strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension; and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex; the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections; the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory; and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories; is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex; in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal; cerebellar; pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt; caudalis-intermedia-oralis; to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL); which is the main source to the motor cortex; and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus; comprising twelve levels; is presented; with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level.
