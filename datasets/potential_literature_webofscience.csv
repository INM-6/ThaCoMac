We aimed to determine the somatotopy and morphological features of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL. Retrograde tracing studies revealed that whisker-related VL neurons were found relatively anterior and medial to those labeled following injection of retrograde tracer into hindpaw motor areas. Simultaneous injections of fluorescent microspheres in both cortical regions did not result in double-labeled neurons in VL. Quantitative analysis of dendritic and somatic morphologies did not reveal any differences between hindpaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons within VL. The morphology of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL is similar to those in other mammals and suggests that mouse can be used as a model system for studying thalamocortical transformations within the motor system as well as plasticity following sensory deprivation or enrichment.</.;"[Brumberg, Joshua C.] CUNY, Queens Coll, Dept Psychol, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Tlamsa, Aileen P.] CUNY, Queens Coll, Dept Biol, Flushing, NY 11367 USA";"City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY)";Brumberg, JC (corresponding author), CUNY, Queens Coll, Dept Psychol, 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.;Joshua.brumberg@qc.cuny.edu;"Brumberg, Joshua/ABA-8799-2021; Brumberg, Joshua/S-9665-2019";"Brumberg, Joshua/0000-0002-9480-7547; "; [NS058758-02];;Thanks to Drs Raddy L.

As differences in cellular and synaptic thalamic organization would be expected to influence neuronal dendritic architecture, we compared somatosensory thalamocortical projection (TCP) neurons from the rat, cat and macaque. The results show that key features of the dendritic branching pattern remain unchanged despite large differences in the size of TCP neurons between the species. The features examined were: (i) ratio of the length of terminal branches to the length of the entire dendritic tree; (ii) the percentage of branch points that gave rise to two daughter branches as opposed to those that gave rise to three or more daughter branches; (iii) the proportional sum of absolute deviations (a measure of branching symmetry), and (iv) the mean branch order of the terminal segments. The present study provides evidence that somatosensory TCP neurons in these species comprise a homogeneous class and share a common dendritic architecture that is conserved across species despite changes in other aspects of thalamic circuitry. This suggests that TCP neuronal form is based on relatively stable genetic blueprint and that epigenetic factors (e.g. synaptic input) resulting from evolutionary changes in thalamic organization have had less influence on dendritic architecture.";"UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, WM KECK FDN, CTR INTEGRAT NEUROSCI, SAN FRANCISCO, CA USA; STANFORD UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT NEUROL & NEUROL SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Stanford University";OHARA, PT (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, DEPT ANAT, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA.;;;;"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE08973] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS26488, NS23347] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;32;6;6;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;1872-6240;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;Jun 20;1994;648;2;;;;;259;264;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91125-8;;;6;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;NU173;7922539;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1994NU17300009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and different parts of the prefrontal cortex are essential in cognitive processes, such as learning and adaptive decision-making. Cortico-thalamocortical interactions involving other dorsal thalamic nuclei, including the anterior thalamus and pulvinar, also influence these cognitive processes. Our work, and that of others, indicates a crucial influence of these interdependent cortico-thalamocortical neural networks that contributes actively to the processing of information within the cortex. Each of these thalamic nuclei also receives potent subcortical inputs that are likely to provide additional influences on their regulation of cortical activity. Here, we highlight our current neuroscientific research aimed at establishing when cortico-MD thalamocortical neural network communication is vital within the context of a rapid learning and memory discrimination task. We are collecting evidence of MD-prefrontal cortex neural network communication in awake, behaving male rhesus macaques. Given the prevailing evidence, further studies are needed to identify both broad and specific mechanisms that govern how the MD, anterior thalamus and pulvinar cortico-thalamocortical interactions support learning, memory and decision-making. Current evidence shows that the MD (and the anterior thalamus) are crucial for frontotemporal communication, and the pulvinar is crucial for frontoparietal communication. Such work is crucial to advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical and physiological bases of these brain functions in humans. In turn, this might offer avenues to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the cognitive deficits often observed in many debilitating neurological disorders and diseases and in neurodegeneration.;"[Perry, Brook A.

The aim of the present study is the characterization of thalamic afferents of these two areas. For this purpose, retrograde neuronal tracers were injected, or placed in crystal form, in areas PEc and PE. We found that the two areas show a similar pattern of thalamic inputs, mainly originating from Lateral Posterior (LP), Pulvinar (Pul), Ventral Posterior Lateral (VPL), and Ventral Lateral (VL) nuclei, all structures known to be involved in visual, somatosensory, and/or sensorimotor processing. Minor afferents were observed from the Centromedian/Parafascicular complex (CM/PF), Central Lateral (CL), Ventral Anterior (VA), and Medial Dorsal (MD) nuclei. LP and VL were more strongly connected to PEc than to PE, while the other main thalamic inputs to the two areas showed slight differences in strength. The part of the Pul mostly connected with areas PEc and PE was the Medial Pul. No labeled cells were found in the retinotopically organized Lateral and Inferior Pul. In the somatotopically organized VPL and VL nuclei, labeled neurons were mainly found in regions likely to correspond to the trunk and limb representations (in particular the legs). These findings are in line with the sensory-motor nature of areas PEc and PE, and with their putative functional roles, being them suggested to be involved in the preparation and control of limb interaction with the environment, and in locomotion.;"[Impieri, Daniele; Gamberini, Michela; Passarelli, Lauretta; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Gamberini, Michela; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rosa, Marcello G.

Several studies have reported impairment of central nervous processes during weightlessness. In this study, neurobiological alterations during 6 degrees head down tilt (HDT) were investigated longitudinally using non-invasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) at 3T in region related to cognitive and movement, such as the thalamus. Scans were performed in five rhesus monkeys before HDT and at 7, 21 and 42 days after HDT. Spectra were processed using LC Model. Statistical analysis of the data obtained demonstrated no significant difference in the bilateral thalamus of macaques. Our MRS data showed reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA) (p<0.05) glutamate/glutamine (Glx) (p<0.05) and elevated myo-inositol (ml) (p<0.05) in the bilateral thalamus during HDT, and all metabolites approached their baseline levels by the fourth scan. These results demonstrate that metabolic changes occur in the thalamus during HDT in rhesus monkeys.

Adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In a previous study (Hackett et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 394:475-95), we determined that the parabelt has topographic connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. Injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (MGd) and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM) nuclei. Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. The rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. The results suggest that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing, which is not influenced by direct inputs from primary cortical or subcortical auditory structures.

To determine the degree of divergence/convergence of thalamocortical projections to mesial [supplementary motor area (SMA)-proper and pre-SMA] and lateral (PMd-c, PMd-r, PMv-c and PMv-r) premotor (PM) subareas, quantitative analyses were performed on the distribution of retrograde labelling after multiple tracer injections in the same animal. The results demonstrate that all PM and SMA subareas receive common inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the relative contribution of these nuclei to thalamocortical projections differs. The largest difference occurs between subareas of SMA, with much greater contribution from the mediodorsal (MD) and area X, and a smaller contribution from the ventral lateral anterior (VLa) and ventral part of the ventral lateral posterior (VLpv) to pre-SMA than to SMA-proper. In PM, differences between subareas are less pronounced; in particular, all receive a significant contribution from MD, the ventral anterior (VApc) and area X. However, there are clear gradients, such as increasing projections from MD to rostral, from VLa and VLpv to caudal, and from dorsal VLp (VLpd) to dorsal premotor subareas. Intralaminar nuclei provide widespread projections to all premotor subareas. The degree of overlap between thalamocortical projections varies among different PM and SMA subareas and different sectors of the thalamus. These variations, which correspond to different origin and topography of thalamocortical projections, are discussed in relation to functional organizations at thalamic and cortical levels.";"Univ Zurich Hosp, Lab Funct Neurosurg, Neurosurg Clin, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Fribourg, Dept Med, Unit Physiol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; Univ Fribourg, Program Neurosci, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland";"University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Fribourg; University of Fribourg";Morel, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich Hosp, Lab Funct Neurosurg, Neurosurg Clin, Sternwartstr 6, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland.;anne.morel@usz.ch;;Rouiller, Eric/0000-0003-1355-6019;;;;;107;57;58;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.";"[Bakouie, F.; Gharibzadeh, S.] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Inst Cognit & Brain Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Towhidkhah, F.] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Cybernet & Modeling Biol Syst Lab, Biomed Engn Fac, Tehran, Iran";"Shahid Beheshti University; Amirkabir University of Technology";Gharibzadeh, S (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Inst Cognit & Brain Sci, Tehran, Iran.;"f_bakouie@sbu.ac.ir; gharibzadeh@aut.ac.ir";Towhidkhah, Farzad/M-3911-2018;"Towhidkhah, Farzad/0000-0002-6977-5029; Towhidkhah, Farzad/0000-0003-3135-9609; gharibzadeh, shahriar/0000-0002-9604-8433";Iran National Science Foundation (INSF);Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF));This study was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF).;;21;1;1;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0090-2977;1573-9007;;NEUROPHYSIOLOGY+;Neurophysiology;OCT;2014;46;5;;;;;391;397;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11062-015-9463-8;;;7;"Neurosciences; Physiology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology";AZ6UQ;;Green Submitted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000348356400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what neural response a given MiSt will produce and possibly allow the development of natural sensation.  To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here, we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we used MiSt in the VPL of macaques, which have a somatosensory system more like humans, as compared to our previous rat work (Li et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post-stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt toward producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.";"[Francis, Joseph Thachil] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn & Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Francis, Joseph Thachil; Rozenboym, Anna; von Kraus, Lee; Xu, Shaohua; Chhatbar, Pratik; Semework, Mulugeta; Hawley, Emerson; Chapin, John] Suny Downstate Med Sch, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Rozenboym, Anna] CUNY, Kingsborough Community Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Chhatbar, Pratik] Duke Univ, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA";"University of Houston System; University of Houston; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Duke University";"Francis, JT (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn & Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;Francis, JT (corresponding author), Suny Downstate Med Sch, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA.";Joey199us@gmail.com;;;DARPA Grants [ONR N001498-00-C-8006, N660010-3-C-8041, N66001-10-C-2008];DARPA Grants;This work was supported by the DARPA Grants ONR N001498-00-C-8006 and N660010-3-C-8041 JC, and N66001-10-C-2008 JF.;;50;0;0;0;4;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-453X;;FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ;Front.

Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay, and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain, detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information. To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control. Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation. The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia.

MMN is thought to represent a comparison of the features of the present stimulus versus a mnemonic template formed by the prior stimuli. METHODS: We used concurrent thalamic and primary auditory cortical (A1) laminar recordings in 7 macaques to evaluate the relative contributions of core (lemniscal) and matrix (nonlemniscal) thalamic afferents to MMN generation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that deviance-related activity is observed mainly in matrix regions of auditory thalamus, MMN generators are most prominent in layer 1 of cortex as opposed to sensory responses that activate layer 4 first and sequentially all cortical layers, and MMN is elicited independent of the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles. Consistent with prior reports, MMN-related thalamocortical activity was strongly inhibited by ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate distinct matrix versus core thalamocortical circuitry underlying the generation of a higher-order brain response (MMN) versus sensory responses.;"[Lakatos, Peter; O'Connell, Monica N.; Barczak, Annamaria; McGinnis, Tammy; Neymotin, Samuel; Schroeder, Charles E.; Smiley, John F.; Javitt, Daniel C.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY USA; [Lakatos, Peter; Smiley, John F.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.; Javitt, Daniel C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; Columbia University; Columbia University";Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, 140 Old Orangeburg Rd, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Peter.Lakatos@nki.rfmh.org;Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019;"Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021; Neymotin, Samuel/0000-0003-3646-5195";"National Institutes of Health [R01DC012947, R01MH109289, R01MH49334, P50MH109429]; Army Research Office [W911NF-19-1-0402]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Army Research Office";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant No. R01DC012947 [to PL and SN], Grant Nos.

To address this issue, the patterns of thalamic and cortical inputs to the rostral (CMAr), dorsal (CMAd), and ventral (CMAv) cingulate motor areas were investigated in the macaque monkey. Tracer injections were made into identified forelimb representations of these areas, and the distributions of retrogradely labeled neurons were analyzed in the thalamus and the frontal cortex. The cells of origin of thalamocortical projections to the CMAr were located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus and the oral division of the ventrolateral nucleus (VLo). On the other hand, the thalamocortical neurons to the CMAd/CMAv were distributed predominantly in the VLo and the oral division of the ventroposterolateral nucleus-the caudal division of the ventrolateral nucleus. Additionally, many neurons in the intralaminar nuclear group were seen to project to the cingulate motor areas. Except for their well-developed interconnections, the corticocortical projections to the CMAr and CMAd/CMAv were also distinctively preferential. Major inputs to the CMAr arose from the presupplementary motor area and the dorsal premotor cortex, whereas inputs to the CMAd/CMAv originated not only from these areas but also from the supplementary motor area and the primary motor cortex. The present results indicate that the CMAr and the caudal cingulate motor area (involving both the CMAd and the CMAv) are characterized by distinct patterns of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, reflecting their functional differences.

In humans, similar to 3.4 million afferents from the LGN are distributed within a V1 surface of similar to 2400 mm(2), an afferent number that is reduced by half in the macaque and by more than two orders of magnitude in the mouse. Thalamocortical afferents are sorted in visual cortex based on the spatial position of their receptive fields to form a map of visual space. The visual resolution within this map is strongly correlated with total number of thalamic afferents that V1 receives and the area available to sort them. The similar to 20,000 afferents of the mouse are only sorted by spatial position because they have to cover a large visual field (similar to 300 deg) within just 4 mm(2) of V1 area. By contrast, the similar to 500,000 afferents of the cat are also sorted by eye input and light/dark polarity because they cover a smaller visual field (similar to 200 deg) within a much larger V1 area (similar to 400 mm(2)), a sorting principle that is likely to apply also to macaques and humans. The increased precision of thalamic sorting allows building multiple copies of the V1 visual map for left/right eyes and light/dark polarities, which become interlaced to keep neurons representing the same visual point close together. In turn, this interlaced arrangement makes cortical neurons with different preferences for stimulus orientation to rotate around single cortical points forming a pinwheel pattern that allows more efficient processing of objects and visual textures.;"[Mazade, Reece; Alonso, Jose Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;;NIH [EY027157, EY05253];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);Supported by NIH grants EY027157 (RM) and EY05253 (JMA).;;122;18;18;2;15;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN;2017;34;;;;;;;;e007;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523817000049;;;9;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";FG0IB;28965507;Green Accepted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000409404300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Three such networks are centered on lateral orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal and cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex and all have been identified with distinct cognitive roles. Although these areas differ in a number of their cortical connections, some of the first anatomical evidence for these networks came from tracer studies demonstrating their distinct patterns of connectivity with the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus. Here, we present evidence for a similar topography of MD thalamus prefrontal connections, using non-invasive imaging and diffusion tractography (DWI-DT) in human and macaque. DWI-DT suggested that there was a high probability of interconnection between medial MD and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, between caudodorsal MD and medial frontal/cingulate cortex, and between lateral MD and lateral prefrontal cortex, in both species. Within the lateral prefrontal cortex a dorsolateral region (the principal sulcus in the macaque and middle frontal gyrus in the human) was found to have a high probability of interconnection with the MD region between the regions with a high probability of interconnection with other parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex and with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. In addition to suggesting that the thalamic connectivity in the macaque is a good guide to human prefrontal cortex, and therefore that there are likely to be similarities in the cognitive roles played by the prefrontal areas in both species, the present results are also the first to provide insight into the topography of projections of an individual thalamic nucleus in the human brain.

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.

Previous work has shown that parenchymal delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in the thalamus by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) can lead to largescale transduction via axonal transport in distal areas including cortex. We used this approach to obtain widespread cortical expression of light-sensitive ion channels. New method: AAV vectors co-expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes were infused into thalamus of three rhesus macaques under MR-guided CED. After six to twelve weeks recovery, in vivo optical stimulation and single cell recording in the cortex was carried out using an optrode in anesthetized animals. Post-mortem immunostaining against YFP was used to estimate the distribution and level of expression of ChR2 in thalamus and cortex. Results: Histological analysis revealed high levels of transduction in cortical layers. The patterns of expression were consistent with known thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits. Dense expression was seen in thalamocortiocal axonal fibers in layers III, IV and VI and in pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI, presumably corticothalamic neurons. In addition we obtained reliable in vivo light-evoked responses in cortical areas with high levels of expression. Comparison with existing methods: Thalamic CED is very efficient in achieving large expressing areas in comparison to convectional techniques both in minimizing infusion time and in minimizing damage to the brain. Conclusion: MR-guided CED infusion into thalamus provides a simplified approach to transduce large cortical areas by thalamo-cortico-thalamic projections in primate brain. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals.;"[Cavanaugh, James; McAlonan, Kerry; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Cavanaugh, J (corresponding author), NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;jrc@lsr.nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health.;;36;7;7;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Hierarchical levels of control, reflecting different levels of abstraction, are represented across prefrontal cortex (PFC). Although the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) is extensively interconnected with PFC, the role of MD in cognitive control is unclear. Tract tracer studies in macaques, involving subsets of PFC areas, have converged on coarse MD-PFC connectivity principles; but proposed finer-grained topographic schemes, which constrain interactions between MD and PFC, disagree in many respects. To investigate a unifying topographic scheme, we performed probabilistic tractography on diffusion MRI data from eight macaque monkeys, and estimated the probable paths connecting MD with each of all 19 architectonic areas of PFC. We found a connectional topography where the orderly progression from ventromedial to anterior to posterolateral PFC was represented from anteromedial to posterolateral MD. The projection zones of posterolateral PFC areas in MD showed substantial overlap, and those of ventral and anteromedial PFC areas in MD overlapped. The exception was cingulate area 24: its projection zone overlapped with projections zones of all other PFC areas. Overall, our data suggest that nearby, functionally related, directly connected PFC areas have partially overlapping projection zones in MD, consistent with a role for MD in coordinating communication across PFC. Indeed, the organizing principle for PFC projection zones in MD appears to reflect the flow of information across the hierarchical, multi-level PFC architecture. In addition, cingulate area 24 may have privileged access to influence thalamocortical interactions involving all other PFC areas.";"[Phillips, Jessica M.; Fish, Lesenia R.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Mohanta, Sounak; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Kecskemeti, Steven R.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Ctr, Brain Imaging Core, Madison, WI 53705 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";"Phillips, JM; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.";"jphillips7@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698; Redinbaugh, Michelle/0000-0003-1367-8606; Mohanta, Sounak/0000-0001-8169-446X; Phillips, Jessica M/0000-0002-8240-7327";"National Institutes of Health [R01MH110311]; Whitehall Foundation [2015-12-71]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation [23017]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitehall Foundation; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health R01MH110311, Whitehall Foundation 2015-12-71 and Brain and Behavior Research Foundation 23017 grants.;;111;14;15;2;9;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;Apr 01;2019;189;;;;;;832;846;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.078;;;15;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";HO7YU;30711468;Green Accepted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000461166900071;View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we examine neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus, with focus on the mediodorsal (MD) and the anterior nuclei (ANT), to determine if neurogenesis of rostral and caudal thalamic nuclei is concurrent or instead temporally staggered. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N = 10) of [H-3]dT labeled specimens, with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Slides were scanned to create digital images for subsequent analysis using Stereo Investigator software. Labeled neurons were mapped within a contour that encompassed the entire rostral thalamus. These maps were superimposed onto closely corresponding sections from the online BrainMaps macaque atlas to facilitate analysis. Our novel approach uncovered a previously undetected spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus. At E30, labeled neurons were located in a compact medial band; at E38-E40, labeling was dense ventrolaterally, and at E43, labeling predominated laterally at rostral levels and was widely distributed at caudal levels. Peak neurogenesis occurs earlier in MD (E30-E43) and ANT (E31-E43) than in LGN (E36-E43) and PUL (E36-E45). Birth-dating of neurons in MD and ANT, two higher order relay nuclei implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, provides further insight into the critical period of vulnerability during which early developmental perturbation may increase incidence of schizophrenia later in life.";"[Spadory, Taylor; Duque, Alvaro; Selemon, Lynn D.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06519 USA";Yale University;Duque, A (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.;alvaro.duque@yale.edu;spadory, taylor/HRE-1815-2023;"Spadory, Taylor/0000-0003-0731-0987; Duque, Alvaro/0000-0002-5086-5438"; [R01MH113257];;This work was supported by Grant R01MH113257.;;47;1;1;1;1;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

First published August 19, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91287.2008. A few studies have been performed in primate basal ganglia-thalamo-prefrontal pathways. Nevertheless, their electrophysiological properties and anatomical arrangements remain obscure. This study examined them in nigro-thalamo-cortical pathways from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the frontal cortex (FRC) via the mediodorsal (MD) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus in monkeys. First, single thalamocortical neurons with SNr input were identified by antidromic responses to FRC stimulation and by inhibitory orthodromic responses with short latencies (<5 ms) to SNr stimulation. Second, single nigrothalamic neurons were found by antidromic responses to stimulation of the portions of the MD and VA where the thalamocortical neurons were recorded. The inhibitory orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons were considered to be monosynaptically induced by nigral stimulation because the latency distribution of the orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons was similar to that of the antidromic responses in the nigrothalamic neurons. Almost all relay neurons in the rostrolateral MD received inhibitory afferents from the caudolateral SNr and projected to the prefrontal area ventral to the principal sulcus, which constituted the densest nigro-thalamo-cortical projections. Meanwhile, neurons in the VA received inhibitory signals from the whole rostrocaudal extent of the SNr and projected to wide regions of the FRC; neurons in its pars magnocellularis mostly projected to different prefrontal areas, while those in its pars parvocellularis projected to motor areas. This report substantiated the topography of thalamocortical neurons monosynaptically receiving inhibitory SNr input and projecting to the FRC in the primate MD and VA at the single-neuron level.";"[Tanibuchi, Ikuo; Kitano, Hiroyuki; Jinnai, Kohnosuke] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Kitano, Hiroyuki] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan";"Shiga University of Medical Science; Shiga University of Medical Science";Tanibuchi, I (corresponding author), Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan.;buchi@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp;;;;;;;42;25;25;0;6;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.";;;Percheron, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, LAB NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPT MOUVEMENT, INSERM U106, F-75015 PARIS, FRANCE.;;"Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013; Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;387;158;159;0;28;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-0173;1872-6321;;BRAIN RES REV;Brain Res.

Paired intracortical deposits of Fast blue (FB) and Diamidino yellow (DY) separated by 100-1500 mu m were made by inserting crystals of dye into the tracks of tungsten microelectrodes used to record receptive field data on area 3b cells. Each injection gave retrograde labeling of one or more clusters of cells extending in elongated anteroposterior arrays through the ventral posterior medial (VPM) or ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus. Double-labeled cells were only found when the distance between the centers of the dye deposits was less than 600 mu m. With interdeposit distances greater than 600 mu m, most clusters of retrogradely labeled cells had a majority of cells labeled by FB or DY, However, even with interdeposit distances of 1-1.5 mm the labeled clusters also contained significant numbers of cells labeled with the other dye. These results and an accompanying regression analysis indicate that the extent of intracortical arborization of single thalamocortical axons in area 3b is no greater than 600 pm. However, adjoining cells in the same part of the thalamic body representation can project to cortical targets as discrepant as 1.5 mm. It is proposed that the fine grain of the cortical representation depends upon inputs from the majority population of each thalamic cell cluster. However, divergent and convergent projections from minority populations of the clusters form a preexisting basis for rapid changes in the cortical representational map under activity-dependent conditions.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;Rausell, Estrella/L-8781-2014;Rausell Tamayo, Estrella/0000-0002-1129-7116;NINDS NIH HHS [NS22317, NS21377] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;61;58;58;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

This is reflected by the influence of thalamic stimulation on cortical activity and behavior as well as apparently cortical lesion syndromes occurring as a function of small thalamic insults. Here, we attempt to noninvasively test the correspondence of structural and functional connectivity of the human thalamus using diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI. Using a large sample of 102 adults, we apply tensor independent component analysis to diffusion MRI tractography data to blindly parcellate bilateral thalamus according to diffusion tractography-defined structural connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI collected in the same subjects, we show that the resulting structurally defined thalamic regions map to spatially distinct, and anatomically predictable, whole-brain functional networks in the same subjects. Although there was significant variability in the functional connectivity patterns, the resulting 51 structural and functional patterns could broadly be reduced to a subset of 7 similar core network types. These networks were distinct from typical cortical resting-state networks. Importantly, these networks were distributed across the brain and, in a subset, map extremely well to known thalamocortico-basal-ganglial loops.;"[O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan; Barker, Gareth J.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Neuroimaging, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Keller, Simon S.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Keller, Simon S.] Walton Ctr Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Dept Radiol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Richardson, Mark P.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Clin Neurosci, London WC2R 2LS, England";"University of London; King's College London; N8 Research Partnership; University of Liverpool; Walton Centre; University of London; King's College London";O'Muircheartaigh, J (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Neuroimaging Sci, Dept Neuroimaging, P089, London SE5 8AF, England.;jonathanom@kcl.ac.uk;"Richardson, Mark P/E-5385-2010; Keller, Simon/IQR-7228-2023; Barker, Gareth J/C-9616-2009; O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan/D-8154-2011";"Richardson, Mark P/0000-0001-8925-3140; Barker, Gareth J/0000-0002-5214-7421; Keller, Simon/0000-0001-5247-9795; O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan/0000-0002-8033-6959";"Wellcome Trust [096195]; UK Medical Research Council grant [MR/K023152/1]; UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant [MR/K013998/1]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsey NHS Foundation Trust; Medical Research Council [MR/K013998/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/K013998/1] Funding Source: UKRI";"Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); UK Medical Research Council grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Maudsey NHS Foundation Trust; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";J.O.M. is supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant Number 096195).

Nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were found in the periphery of the contralateral integument compartment of the VB complex. Thus, they formed a shell at the perimeter of this compartment with a somatotopic organization. The compartment consisted of large parts of nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc). NS neurons were located more caudally than WDR neurons. In the NS zone of VPM, the forehead was represented caudally, and oral structures rostrally. In the ventral NS zone of VPM, there was a sequential representation of the tongue, gum and mandibular skin from the medial to the lateral edge. The hand was represented medially in the NS zone of VPLc, and its representation dominated in the rostral NS zone. There was a sequential representation of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal segments mediolaterally along the dorsal VPLc. In the medial half of ventral NS zone of VPLc, the upper body half was represented, and in the lateral half, the lower body half. The foot was represented at or near the medial edge of lateral half. In the rostral WDR zone, the trunk and peripheral face were represented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AChE histochemistry is very useful in delineating the thalamic nuclei connected with the association cortex and in uncovering thalamic subdivisions that are barely evident on cytoarchitectonic grounds. Moreover, AChE activity reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneities within several thalamic nuclei, like the ventral anterior (VA), where a new ventromedial subdivision (VAvm) is described, the medial pulvinar (PulM) or the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In this nucleus three distinct chemical domains are present: the medial, ventral and lateral sectors characterized by low, moderate and high AChE activities, respectively. The staining pattern of the lateral sector is markedly heterogeneous with patches of intense AChE activity surrounded by a moderately stained matrix. The MD medial sector is connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the AChE-rich patches in the lateral sector are selectively connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal association cortices. In the PulM, a dorsomedial AChE-rich patch is selectively connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the surrounding territory, which shows moderate AChE activity, is preferentially connected with the parietal and temporal cortices. Chemically specific domains in the anterior, ventral anterior, midline, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are also connected with the examined association cortices. These findings indicate that the topographic patterns of the thalamo-cortical connections of primate association areas conform to the chemical architecture of the thalamus. This implies that because each cortical area is connected to a particular set of thalamic regions, the influence of the thalamus on cortical function is exclusive for each area, highly diverse among the various association areas, and subject to a wide range of modulation at the thalamic level.;;;CAVADA, C (corresponding author), UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,FAC MED,DEPT MORPHOL,ARZOBISPO MORCILLO S-N,E-28029 MADRID,SPAIN.;;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388";;;;;43;39;39;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0891-0618;;;J CHEM NEUROANAT;J.

We observed the same 15 distinct architectonic areas in 10 brains. Within the granular, dysgranular, and agranular regions described in prior studies, we identified 4, 4, and 7 distinct areas, respectively. Across brains, these areas have consistent architectonic characteristics, and in flat map reconstructions they display a consistent topological or neighborhood arrangement, despite variations in the size of individual areas between cases. The borders between areas are generally rather sharply defined. Some areas, in particular the dysgranular areas, appear to consistently contain subtle transitions that suggest possible subareas or modules within the well-delimited areas. The presence of a distinct granular area that straddles the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus over its entire posterior-to-anterior extent is consistent with the available evidence on interoceptive thalamocortical projections, and also with the tensile anchor theory of species-specific cortical gyrification. These observations are consonant with the model of homeostatic afferent processing in the primate insula, and they suggest that discrete modules within insular cortex provide the basis for its polymodal integration of all salient activity relevant to ongoing emotional behavior.

Thalamic sections from 15 macaque monkeys were processed for visualization of calbindin (CB), parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (ir). PV-, CR- and SMI-32ir distributions did not show any clear correlation with known functional subdivisions. In contrast, CBir distribution reliably defined two markedly distinct motor thalamic territories, one characterized by high cell and neuropil CBir (CB-positive territory), the other by very low cell and neuropil CBir (CB-negative territory). These two neurochemically distinct compartments, the CB-negative and the CB-positive territories, appear to correspond to the cerebellar- and basal ganglia-recipient territories, respectively. To verify the possible correspondence of the CB-negative territory with the cerebellar-recipient sector of the motor thalamus, we compared the distribution of cerebello-thalamic projections with the distribution of CBir in two monkeys. The distribution of cerebellar afferent terminals was similar to that reported from previous reports and in line with the notion that in the motor thalamus the cerebellar-recipient territory does not respect cytoarchitectonic boundaries. Comparison with CB immunoarchitecture showed very close correspondence in the motor thalamus between the distribution of the anterograde labeling and the CB-negative territory, suggesting that the CB-negative territory represents the architectonic counterpart of the cerebellar-recipient territory. CB immunostaining may therefore represent a helpful tool for describing the association between thalamocortical projections and the basal ganglia or the cerebellar loops and for establishing possible homologies between the motor thalamus of non-human primates and humans.;"Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Fisiol, I-95125 Catania, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Catania";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; Zappalà, Agata/GMX-5010-2022";"Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Zappalà, Agata/0000-0002-0213-776X; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618";;;;;45;19;19;0;3;WILEY-BLACKWELL;MALDEN;COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Here, we demonstrate by combined retrograde tracing and immunocytochemistry that at least some of these are pulvinocortical relay neurons, and further report several distinctive features. First, in contrast with non-giant relay neurons, the giant neurons are often solitary and isolated from a main projection focus. The question thus arises of whether their cortical projections may be non-reciprocal or otherwise distinctive. Second, these neurons are positive for GluR4; but third, they are otherwise neurochemically heterogeneous, in that about one-third are positive for both parvalbumin (PV) and CB. Presumably, these subpopulations are also functionally heterogeneous. These results provide further evidence for the idea of multiple, interleaved organizations within the pulvinar; and they imply that thalamocortical projections are more disparate than has yet been appreciated. Finally, we found that giant CB+ neurons have a distinctive meshwork of large, PV+ terminations, prominent at the first dendritic branch point. In size and location, these resemble inhibitory terminations from the zona incerta or anterior pretectal nucleus (APT), as recently described in higher order thalamic nuclei in rats.

Such dual pattern of corticothalamic projections is well established in rodents and cats for many cortical areas. In non-human primates (monkeys), it has been reported for the primary sensory cortices (A1, V1, S1), the motor and premotor cortical areas and, in the parietal lobe, also for area 7. The present study aimed first at refining the cytoarchitecture parcellation of area 5 into the sub-areas PE and PEa and, second, establishing whether area 5 also exhibits this dual pattern of corticothalamic projection and what is its precise topography. To this aim, the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected in area PE in one monkey and in area PEa in a second monkey. Area PE sends a major projection terminating with small endings to the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LP), ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL), medial pulvinar (PuM) and, but fewer, to ventral lateral posterior nucleus, dorsal division (VLpd), central lateral nucleus (CL) and center median nucleus (CM), whereas giant endings formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL and PuM. For area PEa, the corticothalamic projection formed by small endings was found mainly in LP, VPL, anterior pulvinar (PuA), lateral pulvinar (PuL), PuM and, to a lesser extent, in ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), CL, mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and CM. Giant endings originating from area PEa formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL, PuA, PuM, MD and PuL. Furthermore, the origin of the thalamocortical projections to areas PE and PEa was established, exhibiting clusters of neurons in the same thalamic nuclei as above, in other words predominantly in the caudal thalamus. Via the giant endings CT projection, areas PE and PEa may send feedforward, transthalamic projections to remote cortical areas in the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes contributing to polysensory and sensorimotor integration, relevant for visual guidance of reaching movements for instance.

Advanced imaging techniques have enabled the non-invasive tracing of brain networks to define the human connectome on a millimetre-scale. During early development, the brain undergoes significant changes that are likely represented in the developing connectome, and preterm birth represents a significant environmental risk factor that impacts negatively on early cerebral development. Using tractography to comprehensively map the connections of the thalamocortical unit, we aim to demonstrate that premature extrauterine life due to preterm delivery results in significantly decreased thalamocortical connectivity in the developing human neonate. Methods: T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and 32-direction diffusion tensor images were acquired from 18 healthy term-born neonates (median gestational age: 41(+3)) and 47 preterm infants (median gestational age: 28(+3)) scanned at term-equivalent age. Using a novel processing pipeline for tracing connections in the neonatal brain we map and compare the thalamocortical macro-connectome between groups. Results: We demonstrate that connections between the thalamus and the frontal cortices, supplementary motor areas, occipital lobe and temporal gyri are significantly diminished in preterm infants (FDR-corrected, p < .001). Conclusions: This supports the hypothesis that the thalamocortical system is vulnerable following preterm birth and the tractographic framework presented represents a method for analysing system connectivity that can be readily applied to other populations and neural systems.

However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness.;"[Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Phillips, Jessica M.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Mohanta, Sounak; Andryk, Samantha; Dooley, Gaven L.; Afrasiabi, Mohsen; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Raz, Aeyal] Rambam Hlth Care Campus, Dept Anesthesiol, IL-3109601 Haifa, Israel; [Raz, Aeyal] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53715 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Rambam Health Care Campus; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine";"Redinbaugh, MJ; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53715 USA.";"mredinbaugh@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Redinbaugh, Michelle/0000-0003-1367-8606; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698";"NIH [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; BSF [201732]; WNPRC pilot grant";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); WNPRC pilot grant";We thank M.I.

These afferents may arise from neocortex or from subcortical centers; however, their exact distribution, segregation, or putative absence in given thalamic nuclei are unknown. To unravel the nucleus-specific composition of drivers, we mapped the entire macaque thalamus using vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 to label cortical and subcortical afferents, respectively. Large thalamic territories were innervated exclusively by either giant vGLUT2- or vGLUT1-positive boutons. Codistribution of drivers with different origin was not abundant. In several thalamic regions, no giant terminals of any type could be detected at light microscopic level. Electron microscopic observation of these territories revealed either the complete absence of large multisynaptic excitatory terminals (basal ganglia-recipient nuclei) or the presence of both vGLUT1- and vGLUT2-positive terminals, which were significantly smaller than their giant counterparts (intralaminar nuclei, medial pulvinar). In the basal ganglia-recipient thalamus, giant inhibitory terminals replaced the excitatory driver inputs. The pulvinar and the mediodorsal nucleus displayed subnuclear heterogeneity in their driver assemblies. These results show that distinct thalamic territories can be under pure subcortical or cortical control; however, there is significant variability in the composition of major excitatory inputs in several thalamic regions. Because thalamic information transfer depends on the origin and complexity of the excitatory inputs, this suggests that the computations performed by individual thalamic regions display considerable variability. Finally, the map of driver distribution may help to resolve the morphological basis of human diseases involving different parts of the thalamus.";"[Rovo, Zita; Acsady, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Lab Thalamus Res, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary";"Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Institute of Experimental Medicine; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University";Acsady, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, POB 67, H-1450 Budapest, Hungary.;acsady@koki.hu;"Acsady, Laszlo/C-7773-2014; Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010";"Acsady, Laszlo/0000-0002-0679-2980; ";"Wellcome Trust; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA T 75676, OTKA 81357]; National Office for Research and Technology-ANR TeT";"Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); National Office for Research and Technology-ANR TeT(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (a Wellcome Project Grant to L.

Further, consistent evidence in animal models shows the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) contributes to adaptive decision-making. It is assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial temporal lobes govern these cognitive processes so this evidence suggests that MD contributes a role in these cognitive processes too. Anatomically, the MD has extensive excitatory cortico-thalamo-cortical connections, especially with the PFC. MD also receives modulatory inputs from forebrain, midbrain and brainstem regions. It is suggested that the MD is a higher order thalamic relay of the PFC due to the dual cortico-thalamic inputs from layer V ('driver' inputs capable of transmitting a message) and layer VI ('modulator' inputs) of the PFC. Thus, the MD thalamic relay may support the transfer of information across the PFC via this indirect thalamic route. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the anatomy of MD as a higher order thalamic relay. It also reviews behavioral and electrophysio-logical studies in animals to consider how MD might support the transfer of information across the cortex during learning and decision-making. Current evidence suggests the MD is particularly important during rapid trial-by-trial associative learning and decision-making paradigms that involve multiple cognitive processes. Further studies need to consider the influence of the MD higher order relay to advance our knowledge about how the cortex processes higher order cognition. (c) 2015 The Authors.

ML and STT axons were labeled by the anterograde axon transport of WGA-HRP following injection of the tracer into the contralateral dorsal column nuclei, or the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, respectively. Thalamic tissue was histochemically reacted for the presence of HRP. Serial thin sections were stained with a gold-labeled antibody to GABA, to determine which neuronal elements exhibited GABA immunoreactivity (GABA-ir). Serially sectioned thalamic structures were recorded in electron micrographs and reconstructed in three dimensions by computer. Individual ML axon terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with segments of the proximal dendritic trees of thalamocortical relay neurons and also synapse upon the dendritic appendages of GABA-ir interneurons (local circuit neurons). These GABA-ir dendritic appendages contain synaptic vesicles and are presynaptic (presynaptic dendrites) to the same segments of relay neuron dendrites that receive ML contacts. When analyzed in serial sections and reconstructed by computer, the ML terminals form triadic relationships (ML, GABA appendage, and relay neuron dendrite) or more complex glomerular arrangements involving multiple appendages, all of which then contact the relay neuron dendritic segment. In contrast, multiple STT terminals make synaptic contacts along segments of projection neuron dendrites and are usually the only type of profile to contact that segment of dendrite. More than 85% of the spinal afferents form simple axodendritic synapses with relay cells and do not contact GABA-ir appendages. The thalamic synaptic relationships of ML terminals are fundamentally different from those formed by the STT. Because STT neurons predominately transmit information about noxious stimuli, the simple axodendritic circuitry of the majority of these spinal afferents suggests that the transmission of noxious information is probably not subject to GABAergic modulation by thalamic interneurons, in contrast to the GABAergic processing of non-noxious information carried by the ML afferents. The differences in the GABAergic circuits of the thalamus that mediate ML and STT afferent information are believed to underlie differential somatosensory processing in the forebrain. We suggest that changes in thalamic GABAergic dendritic appendages and GABA receptors following CNS injury may play a role in the genesis of some central pain states.;;;RALSTON, HJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, WM KECK FDN CTR INTEGRAT NEUROSCI, DEPT ANAT, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 21445, NS 23347] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;53;60;62;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Actively detecting a vibrotactile stimulus and reporting its perception elicited a sustained poststimulus beta power increase in VPL and an alpha power decrease in S1, in both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent trials. These oscillatory dynamics in the somatosensory thalamocortical network depended on the behavioral context: they were stronger for the active detection condition than for a passive stimulation condition. Furthermore, contrasting stimulus-present vs. stimulus-absent responses, we found that poststimulus theta power increased in both VPL and S1, and alpha/beta power decreased in S1, reflecting the monkey's perceptual decision but not the motor response per se. Additionally, higher prestimulus alpha power in S1 correlated with an increased probability of the monkey reporting a stimulus, regardless of the actual presence of a stimulus. Thus, we found task-related modulations in oscillatory activity, not only in the neocortex but also in the thalamus, depending on behavioral context. Furthermore, oscillatory modulations reflected the perceptual decision process and subsequent behavioral response. We conclude that these early sensory regions, in addition to their primary sensory functions, may be actively involved in perceptual decision making.;"[Haegens, Saskia] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Haegens, Saskia] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Haegens, Saskia; Jensen, Ole] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Vazquez, Yuriria; Zainos, Antonio; Alvarez, Manuel; Romo, Ranulfo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular Neurociencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Romo, Ranulfo] Colegio Nacl, Mexico City 06020, DF, Mexico";"Columbia University; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Radboud University Nijmegen; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";Romo, R (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular Neurociencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.;rromo@ifc.unam.mx;"Jensenq, Ole/D-2120-2010; Haegens, Saskia/W-2013-2018";"Jensenq, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; Haegens, Saskia/0000-0002-9676-6275; Alvarez, Manuel/0000-0003-4651-3525; romo, ranulfo/0000-0003-3529-3635; Vazquez, Yuriria/0000-0003-4198-1135; zainos, antonio/0000-0001-6137-1794";"Rubicon from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [446.11.009]; Vici from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [453.09.002]; Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme [056-14-011]; International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";"Rubicon from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Vici from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme; International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";"The authors thank Lucia Melloni for insightful feedback on the manuscript.S.H.was supported by Rubicon Grant 446.11.009 from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; O.J.was supported by Vici Grant 453.09.002 from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research and Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme (056-14-011); R.R.was supported by an International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and by grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.";;67;21;21;1;23;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;1091-6490;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Previous studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and those in the caudate nucleus exhibit periodic firing modulation when the animals attempt to detect a single omission of isochronous repetitive audiovisual stimuli. To understand how these subcortical signals are sent and processed through the thalamocortical pathways, we examined single-neuron activities in the central thalamus of two macaque monkeys (one female and one male). We found that three types of neurons responded to each stimulus in the sequence in the absence of movements. Reactive-type neurons showed sensory adaptation and gradually waned the transient response to each stimulus. Predictive-type neurons steadily increased the magnitude of the suppressive response, similar to neurons previously reported in the cerebellum. Switch-type neurons initially showed a transient response, but after several cycles, the direction of firing modulation reversed and the activity decreased for each repetitive stimulus. The time course of Switch-type activity was well explained by the weighted sum of activities of the other types of neurons. Furthermore, for only Switch-type neurons the activity just before stimulus omission significantly correlated with behavioral latency, indicating that this type of neuron may carry a more advanced signal in the system detecting stimulus omission. These results suggest that the central thalamus may transmit integrated signals to the cerebral cortex for temporal information processing, which are necessary to accurately predict rhythmic event timing.;"[Matsuyama, Kei; Tanaka, Masaki] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan";Hokkaido University;Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.;masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp;Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011;Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [17H03539, 18H04928, 18H05523]; Takeda Science Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H03539, 18H05523, 18H04928] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grants 17H03539, 18H04928, and 18H05523).

Severity of deficits and the degree of recovery have been associated with widespread network dysfunction, yet it is not clear how these behavioural and functional brain changes relate with the underlying structural white matter tracts. Here, we investigated whether recovery after unilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions was associated with changes in white matter microstructure across large-scale frontoparietal cortical and thalamocortical networks. Diffusion-weighted imaging was acquired in four male rhesus macaques at pre-lesion, week 1, and week 8-16 post-lesion when target selection deficits largely recovered. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct cortical frontoparietal fiber tracts, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and transcallosal fibers connecting the PFC or posterior parietal cortex (PPC), as well as thalamocortical fiber tracts connecting the PFC and PPC to thalamic nuclei. We found that the two animals with small PFC lesions showed increased fractional anisotropy in both cortical and thalamocortical fiber tracts when behaviour had recovered. However, we found that fractional anisotropy decreased in cortical frontoparietal tracts after larger PFC lesions yet increased in some thalamocortical tracts at the time of behavioural recovery.

This report focuses on posterolateral. thalamus, where prior anterograde tracing observations identified the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMpo) as the major projection target of lamina I STT neurons. Large injections in posterolateral thalamus labeled predominantly STT cells in lamina I throughout the spinal cord. In cases with medium-sized or small injections centered in VMpo, almost all labeled STT cells (similar to 90%) were lamina I neurons.

The thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. Modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant in the rodent thalamus. We show that dopaminergic axons profusely target the human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype ( tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). The dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. We also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. The origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. We propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Investigating this thalamic dopaminergic system should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.";Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;Autonomous University of Madrid;Cavada, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, C Arzobispo Marcillo S-N, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.;carmen.cavada@uam.es;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/K-4737-2019; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/0000-0003-0534-5182; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Rico, Beatriz/0000-0002-0581-851X";;;;;53;217;220;1;18;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The immunostained cells are confined to the dorsal region of this nucleus along its rostrocaudal extent. Measurement of the somatic areas of the immunostained neurons indicated that they correspond to a population of large neurons thought to be projection neurons.

Here we report on the distribution of response modalities to 487 intraoperative thalamic stimulations performed in 24 neurogenic pain (NP), 17 parkinsonian (PD) and 10 neuropsychiatric (Npsy) patients. Threshold responses were subdivided into somatosensory, motor and affective, and compared between medial (central lateral nucleus) and lateral (ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral medial) thalamic nuclei and between patients groups. Major findings were as follows: in the medial thalamus, evoked responses were for a large majority (95%) somatosensory in NP patients, 47% were motor in PD patients, and 54% affective in Npsy patients. In the lateral thalamus, a much higher proportion of somatosensory (83%) than motor responses (5%) was evoked in NP patients, while the proportion was reversed in PD patients (69% motor vs. 21% somatosensory). These results provide the first evidence for functional cross-modal changes in lateral and medial thalamic nuclei in response to intraoperative stimulations in different functional disorders. This extensive functional reorganization sheds new light on wide-range plasticity in the adult human thalamocortical system. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the functional connectivity profile that was observed after the training was altered. These changes were accompanied by white matter changes in the ventral prefrontal tract, although the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus remained unchanged.

However, the functional contribution of the rhesus macaque monkey parvocellular nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDpc) in these key higher cognitive processes remains unknown. This study investigated the impact of MDpc damage in cognition. Preoperatively, animals were trained on an object-in-place scene discrimination task that assesses rapid learning of novel information within each session. Bilateral neurotoxic (NMDA and ibotenic acid) MDpc lesions did not impair new learning unless the monkey had also sustained damage to the magnocellular division of the MD (MDmc). Contralateral unilateral MDpc and MDmc damage also impaired new learning, while selective unilateral MDmc damage produced new learning deficits that eventually resolved with repeated testing. In contrast, during food reward (satiety) devaluation, monkeys with either bilateral MDpc damage or combined MDpc and MDmc damage showed attenuated food reward preferences compared to unoperated control monkeys; the selective unilateral MDmc damage left performance intact. Our preliminary results demonstrate selective dissociable roles for the two adjacent nuclei of the primate MD, namely, MDpc, as part of a frontal cortical network, and the MDmc, as part of a frontal-temporal cortical network, in learning, memory and the cognitive control of behavioural choices after changes in reward value. Moreover, the functional cognitive deficits produced after differing MD damage show that the different subdivisions of the MD thalamus support distributed neural networks to rapidly and fluidly incorporate task-relevant information, in order to optimise the animals' ability to receive rewards.";"[Chakraborty, Subhojit; Ouhaz, Zakaria; Mason, Stuart; Mitchell, Anna S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Tinsley Bldg,Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SR, England";University of Oxford;Mitchell, AS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Tinsley Bldg,Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SR, England.;anna.mitchell@psy.ox.ac.uk;"Mitchell, Anna S/Q-1196-2019; Ouhaz, Zakaria/AAB-7622-2019";"Mitchell, Anna S/0000-0001-8996-1067; ";"UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award [G0800329]; Wellcome Trust [110157/Z/15/Z]; Royal Society Newton International Training Fellowship [NF160862]; MRC [G0800329] Funding Source: UKRI; Wellcome Trust [110157/Z/15/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust";"UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Royal Society Newton International Training Fellowship(Royal Society); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)";We thank G.

Recent work in macaques suggests that the thalamus conveys corollary discharge information of upcoming saccades passing from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye field. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the thalamus in humans by assessing the effect of thalamic lesions on the processing of corollary discharge information. Thirteen patients with selective thalamic lesions and 13 healthy age-matched control subjects performed a saccadic double-step task in which retino-spatial dissonance was induced, i.e. the retinal vector of the second target and the movement vector of the second saccade were different. Thus, the subjects could not rely on retinal information alone, but had to use corollary discharge information to correctly perform the second saccade. The amplitudes of first and second saccades were significantly smaller in patients than in controls. Five thalamic lesion patients showed unilateral deficits in using corollary discharge information, as revealed by asymmetries compared with the other patients and controls. Three patients with lateral thalamic lesions including the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) were impaired contralaterally to the side of damage and one patient with a lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) was impaired ipsilaterally to the lesion. The largest asymmetry was found in a patient with a bilateral thalamic lesion. The results provide evidence for a thalamic involvement in the processing of corollary discharge information in humans, with a potential role of both the VL and MD nuclei.;"Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Neuropsychol, Fac Psychol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Gen Zool & Neurobiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Inst Grad Sch Neurosci, Bochum, Germany; Klinikum Dortmund, Dept Neurol, Dortmund, Germany";"Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum; Klinikum Dortmund";Bellebaum, C (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Neuropsychol, Fac Psychol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.;christian.bellebaum@ruhr-uni-bochum.de;;;;;;;54;81;80;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;MAY;2005;128;;5;;;;1139;1154;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awh474;;;16;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;919RM;15758033;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000228635300023;View Full Record in Web of Science

To not rely an the rough definition of cytoarchitectonic boundaries in the thalamus, monkeys were subjected to multiple injections of tracers (four to seven) in the primary (M1), premotor (PM), and supplementary (SMA) motor cortical areas and in area 46. The cortical areas were distributed into five groups, each receiving inputs from a specific set of thalamic nuclei: 1) M1; 2) SMA-proper and the caudal part of the dorsal PM (PMdc); 3) the rostral and caudal parts of the ventral PM (PMvr and PMvc); 4) the rostral part of the dorsal PM (PMdr); and 5) the superior and inferior parts of area 46 (area 46sup and area 46inf). A major degree of overlap was obtained for the origins of the thalamocortical projections directed to areas 46inf and 46sup and for those terminating in SMA-proper and PMdc. PMvc and PMvr received inputs from adjacent and/or common thalamic regions. In contrast, the degree of overlap between M1 and SMA was smaller. The projection to M1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to PM. Thalamic inputs to the motor cortical areas (M1, SMA, PMd, and PMv), in general, were segregated from those directed to area 46, except in the mediodorsal nucleus, in which there was clear overlap of the territories sending projections to area 46, SMA-proper, and PMdc.

Despite the pervasive role of the midline thalamus in cognition and disease, there is a limited understanding of its function in humans, likely due to the absence of a rigorous noninvasive neuroimaging methodology to identify its location. Here, we introduce a new method for identifying the midline thalamus in vivo using probabilistic tractography and k-means clustering with diffusion weighted imaging data. This approach clusters thalamic voxels based on data-driven cortical and subcortical connectivity profiles and then segments the midline thalamus according to anatomical connectivity tracer studies in rodents and macaques. Results from two different diffusion weighted imaging sets, including adult data (22-35 years) from the Human Connectome Project (n = 127) and adolescent data (9-14 years) collected at Florida International University (n = 34) showed that this approach reliably classifies midline thalamic clusters. As expected, these clusters were most evident along the dorsal/ventral extent of the third ventricle and were primarily connected to the agranular medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), nucleus accumbens, and medial temporal lobe regions. The midline thalamus was then bisected based on a human brain atlas into a dorsal midline thalamic cluster (paraventricular and paratenial nuclei) and a ventral midline thalamic cluster (rhomboid and reuniens nuclei). This anatomical connectivity-based identification of the midline thalamus offers the opportunity for necessary investigation of this region in vivo in the human brain and how it relates to cognitive functions in humans, and to psychiatric and neurological disorders.;"[Reeders, Puck C.; Nunez, M.

Action selection in the face of dynamic reward associations requires several cognitive processes: registering a change in value of the primary reinforcer, adjusting the value of secondary reinforcers to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer, and guiding action selection to optimal choices. Flexible responding has been evaluated extensively using reinforcer devaluation tasks. Performance on this task relies upon amygdala, Areas 11 and 13 of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Differential contributions of amygdala and Areas 11 and 13 of OFC to specific sub-processes have been established, but the role of MD in these sub-processes is unknown. Pharmacological inactivation of the macaque MD during specific phases of this task revealed that MD is required for reward valuation and action selection.

Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3% cumulative FLN), high local intrinsic connectivity (80% FLN), high-input form neighboring areas (15% cumulative FLN), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3% cumulative FLN). Corticocortical FLN values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low FLN values.;"[Markov, N.

Previ-ous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of age in rhesus macaque brains have been prone to low statistical power, unbalanced sex ratio and lack of a complete age range. To overcome these problems, the current study surveyed structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 66 animals, 34 females (aged 6-31 years) and 32 males (aged 5-27 years). Differences observed in older animals, in-cluded enlargement of the lateral ventricles and a smaller volume in the frontal cortex, caudate, puta-men, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Unexpected, greater volume, were measured in older animals in the hippocampus, amygdala, and globus pallidus. There were also numerous differences between males and females with respect to age in both white and gray matter regions.

Each pathway processes information relevant to directed reaching tasks, but whereas VPLc receives its major input from the spinal cord and external environment, the primary afferent to the pulvinar is cortical. Using combined tracer and thick fixed slice procedures, the some/dendritic morphology of TC neuron populations (with known destination) was shown to be quantitatively similar within VPLc and the pulvinar. This implies that differences in information processing in VPLc (a primary relay) and the pulvinar (an integrative thalamic nucleus) are not defined by a distinctive TC morphology, but rather by the connections of these neuron populations. Two morphologically distinct types of CT axon were observed within the medial pulvinar and VPLc. The more common Type E were fine, had boutons en passant and diffuse terminal bifurcations ending in masses of tiny boutons. Type R axons were thicker, smooth, and terminated in localised clusters of large terminal boutons. Each type had a unique pattern of termination reflecting a distinct action on target neuron populations. The spatial relationship between TC distribution territories and CT terminal fields was examined within the medial pulvinar and VPLc by using anterograde and retrograde tracers injected together within cortical areas 7a, and 3b/1, respectively. Spatial overlap was incomplete within both thalamic nuclei. Our findings show a more complex relationship between TC and CT neuron populations than previously demonstrated.

Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. Methods: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. Results: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. Conclusion: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGrNs of humans.

Thalamocortical inputs arise in parallel from four divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), which have regionally distinct projection patterns. These inputs terminate in layers IIIb and/or IV, and are assumed to be glutamatergic, although this has not been verified. In the present study, immunoreactivity (-ir) for the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2, was used to estimate the regional and laminar distribution of the glutamatergic thalamocortical projection in the macaque auditory cortex. Coronal sections containing auditory cortex were processed for VGluT2 and other markers concentrated in the thalamorecipient layers: cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and parvalbumin. Marker expression was studied with wide field and confocal microscopy. The main findings were: (1) VGkuT2-ir was highest in the core, intermediate in the belt, and sparse in the parabelt; (2) VGluT2-ir was concentrated in the neuropil of layers IIIb/IV in the core and layer IIIb in the belt; (3) VGluT2-ir matched regional and laminar expression of the other chemoarchitectonic markers. The results indicate that the glutamatergic thalamic projection to auditory cortex, as indexed by VGluT-2-ir, varies along the core-belt-parabelt axis in a manner that matches the gradients of other markers. These chemoarchitectonic features are likely to subserve regional differences in neuronal activity between regions of auditory cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether the organization of the thalamocortical (TC) systems for different modalities partly overlap, representing an anatomical support for multisensory and sensorimotor interplay in thalamus. In 2 macaque monkeys, 6 neuroanatomical tracers were injected in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex (PE/PEa in area 5), and dorsal and ventral premotor cortical areas (PMd, PMv), demonstrating the existence of overlapping territories of thalamic projections to areas of different modalities (sensory and motor). TC projections, distinct from the ones arising from specific unimodal sensory nuclei, were observed from motor thalamus to PE/PEa or auditory cortex and from sensory thalamus to PMd/PMv. The central lateral nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus project to all injected areas, but the most significant overlap across modalities was found in the medial pulvinar nucleus. The present results demonstrate the presence of thalamic territories integrating different sensory modalities with motor attributes. Based on the divergent/convergent pattern of TC and corticothalamic projections, 4 distinct mechanisms of multisensory and sensorimotor interplay are proposed.;"[Cappe, Celine; Rouiller, Eric M.] Univ Fribourg, Unit Physiol, Dept Med, Fac Sci, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Cappe, Celine; Rouiller, Eric M.] Univ Fribourg, Program Neurosci, Dept Med, Fac Sci, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Cappe, Celine; Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse 3, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, UMR CNRS 5549, Fac Med Rangueil, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Morel, Anne] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Funct Neurosurg, Neurosurg Clin, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cappe, Celine] CHU Vaudois, Funct Elect Neuroimaging Lab, Neuropsychol & Neurorehab Serv, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cappe, Celine] CHU Vaudois, Serv Radiol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cappe, Celine] Univ Lausanne, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland";"University of Fribourg; University of Fribourg; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV); University of Lausanne";Rouiller, EM (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Unit Physiol, Dept Med, Fac Sci, Chemin Musee 5, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.;eric.rouiller@unifr.ch;"Cappe, Celine/F-4906-2013; Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009";"Barone, Pascal/0000-0003-0125-7468; Rouiller, Eric/0000-0003-1355-6019";"Swiss National Science Foundation [31-61857.00, 310000-110005, 31-68248.02]; Novartis Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation Center of Competence in Research";"Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Novartis Foundation(Novartis); Swiss National Science Foundation Center of Competence in Research(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";"Swiss National Science Foundation (grants no. 31-61857.00, 310000-110005 to E.

Although it has been shown that both the cortical and thalamic representations can reorganize, uncertainties exist regarding the extent, nature, and time course of changes at each level. We have determined how cortical representations in the somatosensory area 3b and the ventroposterior ( VP) nucleus of thalamus are affected by long standing unilateral dorsal column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys. In monkeys with recovery periods of 22-23 months, the intact face inputs expanded into the deafferented hand region of area 3b after complete or partial lesions of the dorsal columns. The expansion of the face region could extend all the way medially into the leg and foot representations. In the same monkeys, similar expansions of the face representation take place in the VP nucleus of the thalamus, indicating that both these processing levels undergo similar reorganizations. The receptive fields of the expanded representations were similar in somatosensory cortex and thalamus. In two monkeys, we determined the extent of the brain reorganization immediately after dorsal column lesions. In these monkeys, the deafferented regions of area 3b and the VP nucleus became unresponsive to the peripheral touch immediately after the lesion. No reorganization was seen in the cortex or the VP nucleus. A comparison of the extents of deafferentation across the monkeys shows that even if the dorsal column lesion is partial, preserving most of the hand representation, it is sufficient to induce an expansion of the face representation.;"[Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India; [Jain, Neeraj; Qi, Hui-Xin; Collins, Christine E.; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC); Vanderbilt University";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010;Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850;"National Institutes of Health [NS16446]; Wellcome Trust [063259/Z/00/Z(N.J.)]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant NS16446 ( J.

In an effort to shed light on the neuroanatomical organization of the PMC, we undertook a study to identify and analyze the thalamocortical connections of these cortices. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in the posterior cingulate (PCC), retrosplenial (RSC), medial parietal cortices (MPC), and posterior cingulate sulcus (PCS), and the labeling patterns within the thalamus were analyzed. Three afferent projection patterns were observed to the PMC from the thalamus: a PCC/RSC pattern that involved the anterior thalamic nuclei, an MPC pattern that involved the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, and a PCS pattern that involved the ventral thalamic nuclei. Additionally, a shared pattern of projections from the anterior intralaminar nuclei (AILN) and posterior thalamic nuclei (PTN) to all cortical regions of the PMC was observed. Our findings suggest that distinct regions within the PMC are supplied by distinctive patterns of thalamic input, but also share common projections from intralaminar and posterior thalamic sources. In addition, we relate our findings to functional abnormalities in aging and dementia, and address a domain-like pattern of thalamocortical labeling of the PMC that is drawn selectively and collectively from multiple thalamic nuclei.;"[Buckwalter, Joseph A.; Parvizi, Josef; Van Hoesen, Gary W.] Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Buckwalter, Joseph A.; Parvizi, Josef; Van Hoesen, Gary W.] Univ Iowa, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Morecraft, Robert J.] Univ S Dakota, Sch Med, Lab Neurol Sci, Div Basic Biomed Sci, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA";"University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of South Dakota";Buckwalter, JA (corresponding author), Univ S Dakota, Ctr Autishm Res, 8110 La Jolla Shores Dr Suite 201, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;jbuckwalter@ucsd.edu;;Buckwalter, Joseph/0000-0001-9758-7255;NINDS NIH HHS [P01 NS019632, R56 NS046367, R01 NS046367, NS 19632, R01 NS014944, NS 046367, NS 14944] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;101;28;29;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Although QSM has many applications in detecting iron deposits in the human brain, including the distribution of iron deposits in specific brain regions, the change of iron deposition with aging, and the comparison of iron deposits between diseased groups and healthy controls, few studies have applied QSM to non-human primates, while most animal brain experiments focus on biochemical and anatomical results instead of non-invasive experiments. Additionally, brain imaging in children's research is difficult, but can be substituted using young rhesus monkeys, which are very similar to humans, as research animals. Therefore, understanding the relationship between iron deposition and age in rhesus macaques' brains can offer insights into both the developmental trajectory of magnetic susceptibility in the animal model and the correlated evidence in children's research. Twenty-three healthy rhesus macaque monkeys (23 +/- 7.85 years, range 2-29 years) were included in this research. Seven regions of interest (ROIs-globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, red nucleus) have been analyzed in terms of QSM and R-2* (apparent relaxation rate). Susceptibility in most ROIs correlated significantly with the growth of age, similarly to the results for R-2*, but showed different trends in the thalamus and red nucleus, which may be caused by the different sensitivities of myelination and iron deposition in R-2* and QSM analysis. By assessing the correlation between iron content and age in healthy rhesus macaques' brains using QSM, we provide a piece of pilot information on normality for advanced animal disease models. Meanwhile, this study also could serve as the normative basis for further clinical studies using QSM for iron content quantification. Due to the comparison of the susceptibility on the same experimental objects, this research can also provide practical support for future research on characteristics for QSM and R-2*.;"[Wu, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Anim Models & Human Dis Mech, Kunming Inst Zool, Chinese Acad Sci & Yunnan Prov, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Siyue; Pan, Boyang; Chen, Honghua] RadioDynam Healthcare, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Resource Ctr Nonhuman Primates, Kunming Primate Res Ctr, Kunming Inst Zool, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Natl Res Facil Phenotyp & Genet Anal Model Anim P, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xintian] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Gong, Nan-Jie] Tsinghua Univ, Vector Lab Intelligent Med Imaging & Neural Engn, Int Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tsinghua University";"Hu, XT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Gong, NJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Vector Lab Intelligent Med Imaging & Neural Engn, Int Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China.";"xthu@mail.kiz.ac.cn; nanjie.gong@gmail.com";Gong, Nan-Jie/H-8002-2012;"Gong, Nan-Jie/0000-0001-9249-413X; PENG, Siyue/0000-0002-9923-2930";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [XDB32060200]; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2019B030335001]; CAS Light of West China program; Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province [202001AT070130]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31960178, 31800901, 81771387, 81941014]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0801403]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [2020PJD038]";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; CAS Light of West China program; Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program)";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Grant/Award Number: XDB32060200; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019B030335001; CAS Light of West China program, and the Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 202001AT070130; the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31960178, 31800901, 81771387, 81941014; National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFA0801403; Shanghai Pujiang Program, Grant/Award Number: 2020PJD038";;47;1;1;1;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0952-3480;1099-1492;;NMR BIOMED;NMR Biomed.;SEP;2022;35;9;;;;;;;e4750;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4750;;May 22;10;"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy";3R0LW;35474524;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000795066000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, mapping the neuronal projections with individual-axon resolution in the large and complex primate brain is still challenging. Herein, we describe a highly efficient pipeline for three-dimensional mapping of the entire macaque brain with subcellular resolution. The pipeline includes a novel poly-N-acryloyl glycinamide (PNAGA)based embedding method for long-term structure and fluorescence preservation, high-resolution and rapid whole-brain optical imaging, and image post-processing. The cytoarchitectonic information of the entire macaque brain was acquired with a voxel size of 0.32 gm x 0.32 gm x 10 gm, showing its anatomical structure with cell distribution, density, and shape. Furthermore, thanks to viral labeling, individual long-distance projection axons from the frontal cortex were for the first time reconstructed across the entire brain hemisphere with a voxel size of 0.65 gm x 0.65 gm x 3 gm. Our results show that individual cortical axons originating from the prefrontal cortex simultaneously target multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain. This pipeline provides an efficient method for cellular and circuitry investigation of the whole macaque brain with individual-axon resolution, and can shed light on brain function and disorders.

One likely source is the central thalamus, which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Because the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye position signals arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, because the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye position signals in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye position signals in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye position signals were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye position signals to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that 2 distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye position signals from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye position signals through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks.;Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan;Hokkaido University;Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, North 15,West 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.;masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp;Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011;Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;;;;;55;35;36;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Six injections were within the limits of cytoarchitectural area PGm, one in area 31 and one in area PEci. Precuneate areas shared strong input from the posterior thalamus (lateral posterior nucleus and pulvinar complex) and moderate input from the medial, lateral, and intralaminar thalamic regions. Area PGm received strong connections from the subdivisions of the pulvinar linked to association and visual function (the medial and lateral nuclei), whereas areas 31 and PEci received afferents from the oral division of the pulvinar. All three cytoarchitectural areas also received input from subdivisions of the lateral thalamus linked to motor function (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), with area PEci receiving additional input from a subdivision linked to somatosensory function (ventral posterior lateral nucleus). Finally, only PGm received substantial limbic association afferents, mainly via the lateral dorsal nucleus. These results indicate that area PGm integrates information from visual association, motor and limbic regions of the thalamus, in line with a hypothesized role in spatial cognition, including navigation. By comparison, dorsal precuneate areas (31 and PEci) are more involved in sensorimotor functions, being akin to adjacent areas of the dorsal parietal cortex.;"[Gamberini, Michela; Passarelli, Lauretta; Impieri, Daniele; Fattori, Patrizia; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Worthy, Katrina H.; Burman, Kathleen J.; Rosa, Marcello G.

Hence, we expected that the consciousness neuronal correlate covers these properties in structural level. These properties could be captured in small-worldness properties, i.e. high clustering coefficient and low path-length. Thalamocortical (TC) loop and cortex are two main candidates for Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC). We studied small-worldness in these systems. For this purpose, we calculated clustering coefficients, characteristic path lengths and their robustness against lesions. We simulated lesions in two ways: eliminating connections, and deleting nodes. We used anatomical connections of TC and cortex of macaque from the CoCoMac neuroinformatic database. Our results show that: 1) Lesions causes an increase in path length and decrease in clustering coefficient which cause the destruction of the integration and segregation capabilities of brain network; 2) Deleting the connections is more destructive than deleting the nodes; 3) During high levels of lesions, the thalamo-cortical connections are more important than cortico-cortical connections in the sense of clustering coefficient. In terms of path-length, during high levels of nodes' lesions, the thalamo-cortical connections are more important than cortico-cortical connections, while during edges' lesions cortico-cortical connections are more important than thalamo-cortical connections (C) 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

The source of the thalamic projections from the medial mammillary nucleus showed strikingly different patterns of organization depending on the site of the injection within the two anterior thalamic nuclei, anterior medialis and anterior ventralis. These data reveal at least two distinct modes by which the primate medial mammillary bodies can regulate anterior thalamic function. Projections to the thalamic nucleus anterior medialis arise mainly from the pars lateralis of the medial mammillary nucleus. A particularly dense source is the dorsal cap in the posterior half of the pars lateralis, a subregion that has not previously been distinguished. In contrast, neurons spread evenly across the medial mammillary nucleus gave rise to projections more laterally in the anterior thalamic nuclei. A third pattern of medial mammillary neurons appeared to provide the source of projections to the rostral midline thalamic nuclei. In contrast, the labeled cells in the lateral mammillary nucleus were evenly spread across that nucleus, irrespective of injection site. In addition to the established projection to anterior dorsalis, the lateral mammillary nucleus appears to project lightly to a number of other thalamic nuclei, including lateralis dorsalis, anterior medialis, anterior ventralis, and the rostral midline nuclei, e.g. nucleus reuniens. These anatomical findings not only reveal novel ways of grouping the neurons within the medial mammillary nucleus, but also indicate that the mammillothalamic connections support cognition in multiple ways.;"NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Cardiff University";Saunders, RC (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;richardsaunders@mail.nih.gov;Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010;"Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308; Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773";;;;;52;38;38;0;4;BLACKWELL PUBLISHING;OXFORD;9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Lamina I terminations were identified by anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran, and 109 boutons on 38 terminal fibers were closely studied in series of ultrathin sections. Five unlabeled terminal boutons of similar appearance were also examined in detail. Three-dimensional, volume-rendered computer models were reconstructed from complete series of serial sections for 29 boutons on 10 labeled terminal fibers and one unlabeled terminal fiber. In addition, postembedding immunogold staining for GABA was obtained in alternate sections through 23 boutons. Lamina I TSTT terminations in VMpo generally have several large boutons (mean length = 2.16 mum, mean width = 1.29 mum) that are densely packed with vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts on low-order dendrites of VMpo neurons (mean diameter 1.45 mum). They are closely associated with GABAergic presynaptic dendrites (PSDs), and nearly all form classic triadic arrangements (28 of 29 reconstructed boutons). Consecutive boutons on individual terminal fibers make multiple contacts with a single postsynaptic dendrite and can show evidence of progressive complexity. Dendritic appendages that enwrap and invaginate the terminal bouton constitute additional anatomic evidence for secure, high-fidelity synaptic transfer. These observations provide direct ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that VMpo is a lamina I TSTT thalamocortical relay nucleus in primates that subserves pain, temperature, itch, and other sensations related to the physiological condition of the body.

This study attempts to identify the correlation between thalamic relay cells and functional activity evoked in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) of cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys. Wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA:HRP) was iontophoretically injected into physiologically determined sites in the somatosensory cortex, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminals in corresponding somatosensory thalamic regions. In the same animals, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) experiments were carried out 2 days later, using the somatic stimuli identified as best exciting the cortical neurons. Stimulation to the limbs produced crescent-shaped clusters of metabolic label arranged in a somatotopically organized fashion in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Following WGA:HRP injections into area 3b, the stimulus-evoked 2DG label was colocalized with the retrograde and anterograde tracer. This finding suggests that the location of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity can be predicted by the presence of transported WGA:HRP clusters.;;;MA, W (corresponding author), UNIFORMED SERV UNIV HLTH SCI,DEPT ANAT,4301 JONES BRIDGE RD,BETHESDA,MD 20814, USA.;;Juliano, Sharon/AAO-1030-2020;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 24014] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;27;4;4;0;0;GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC;NEW YORK;72 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

Here we test this hypothesis using immunohistochemistry against the dopamine transporter (DAT) in adult macaque and rat brains. The extent and density of DAT-immunoreactive (-ir) axons were remarkably greater in the macaque dorsal thalamus, where the mediodorsal association nucleus and the ventral motor nuclei held the densest immunolabeling. In contrast, sparse DAT immunolabeling was present in the rat dorsal thalamus; it was mainly located in the mediodorsal, paraventricular, ventral medial, and ventral lateral nuclei. The reticular nucleus, zona incerta, and lateral habenular nucleus held numerous DAT-ir axons in both species. Ultrastructural analysis in the macaque mediodorsal nucleus revealed that thalamic interneurons are a main postsynaptic target of DAT-ir axons; this suggests that the marked expansion of the dopamine innervation in the primate in comparison to the rodent thalamus may be related to the presence of a sizable interneuron population in primates.

To characterize the pathways and types of signals supplied to cortex, we recorded responses to rotational and/or translational stimuli in the macaque thalamus. Few cells responded to rotation alone, with most showing convergence between semicircular canal and otolith signals. During sinusoidal rotation, thalamic responses lead head velocity by similar to 30 degrees on average at frequencies between 0.01-4 Hz. During translation, neurons encoded combinations of linear acceleration and velocity. In general, thalamic responses were similar to those recorded in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei using identical testing paradigms, but differed from those of vestibular afferents. Thalamic responses represented a biased continuum: most cells more strongly encoded translation and fewer cells modulated primarily in response to net gravitoinertial acceleration. Responsive neurons were scattered within a large area that included regions of the ventral posterior and ventral lateral nuclei, and so were not restricted to the known vestibular nuclei projection zones. To determine the origins of these responses, a retrograde tracer was injected into a dorsolateral thalamic site where rotation/translation-sensitive cells were encountered. This injection labeled neurons in the rostral contralateral anterior interposed and fastigial nuclei, but did not label cells within the vestibular nuclei. Examination of thalamic terminations after tracer injections into the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei indicated that most vestibular responsive units fall within the thalamic terminal zones of these nuclei. Thus, vestibular signals, which are supplied to the thalamus from both vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, are positioned for distribution to widespread cortical areas.;"[Meng, Hui; Dickman, J.

Relating the anatomical connections of PPC to its neurophysiological functions may elucidate the organization of the parietal-frontal network. In owl and squirrel monkeys, long-duration electrical stimulation distinguished several functional zones within the PPC and motor/premotor cortex (M1/PM). Multijoint forelimb movements reminiscent of reach, defense, and grasp behaviors characterized each functional zone. In PPC, functional zones were organized parallel to the lateral sulcus. Thalamocortical connections of PPC and M1/PM zones were investigated with retrograde tracers. After several days of tracer transport, brains were processed, and labeled cells in thalamic nuclei were plotted. All PPC zones received dense inputs from the lateral posterior nucleus and the anterior pulvinar. PPC zones received additional projections from ventral lateral (VL) divisions of motor thalamus, which were also the primary source of input to M1/PM. Projections to PPC from rostral motor thalamus were sparse. Dense projections from ventral posterior (VP) nucleus of somatosensory thalamus distinguished the rostrolateral grasp zone from the other PPC zones.

In order to further test these differences, we used electrical stimulation to map the ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei of the thalamus in three ketamine anaesthetised monkeys. Movements were readily evoked from VL at currents of down to 10 mu A. The movements were typically multijoint, and stimulation could evoke arm and trunk or arm and facial movement at the same current threshold. Evoked arm movements often involved multiple joints, with or without finger movements. Facial movements included the lips, tongue, jaw, eyebrows and, occasionally, the eyes. The thalamic map was topographic, but complex with at least two separate regions related to arm movement. Very few sites within the VA could stimulate movement, even at high currents. We therefore suggest that the cerebellar projections to motor regions of the cortex, which pass through the VL thalamic nuclei, have a different relationship and are closer to movement execution than the projections from basal ganglia via the ventro-anterior nucleus.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England";University of Oxford;Miall, RC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PT, England.;;Miall, R.

Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus.;"[Galvan, Adriana; Hu, Xing; Smith, Yoland; Wichmann, Thomas] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Galvan, Adriana; Smith, Yoland; Wichmann, Thomas] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA";"Emory University; Emory University";Galvan, A (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.;agalvan@emory.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P51-OD011132]; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center) [P50-NS071669, GR01-NS083386]";"National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center)";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (Grant P51-OD011132 to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center), NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center Grant P50-NS071669 and Grant GR01-NS083386 to T.W.).

Until recently, however, longitudinal characterization of in vivo thalamus dynamics had not been reported. In this study, we investigated the metabolism in the thalamus to identify the changes that occur following Coriaria lactone (CL)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and to observe whether the epileptiform discharges could present a difference between the left and right thalami. Five rhesus monkeys underwent whole-brain MRI and single-voxel MRS on a Siemens Trio Tim 3-T MR scanner with a 12-channel head coil. Spectra were processed using LCModel. Scans were performed in five animals before SE and at 1, 7, 21 and 42?days after the onset of SE. Statistical analysis of the data obtained demonstrated no significant difference in the bilateral thalamus of healthy macaques. Our MRS data showed symmetrical distributions of N-acetylaspartate in the right and left thalami after SE (p?=?0.003). In addition, this longitudinal study demonstrated elevated glutamate/glutamine (p?<?0.05) and reduced myo-inositol (p?<?0.05) in the bilateral thalamus 1?day after SE, and all metabolites approached their baseline levels by the fifth scan. Our results demonstrate that metabolic changes occur in the thalamus during CL-induced SE in rhesus monkeys. The various metabolic changes may indicate that the left thalamus is more vulnerable to epileptic strike.

In each experiment, single or multiple injections of various retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into adjacent regions or areas. In two experiments, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the lateral pulvinar, respectively. The results show that the thalamo-cortical projection from LGN to striate cortex and from pulvinar to the prestriate cortex are similarly organized, but the geniculo-striate projection is more precise than the pulvinar-prestriate projection. The pulvinar-prestriate projection is topographically organized and preserves topological neighbourhood relations. Projection zones to the various visual areas are concentrically wrapped around each other. The projection zone to area 18 constitutes a central core region. It begins ventro-laterally in PuL where the pulvinar is in contact with the LGN. This contact zone we called the hilus region of the pulvinar. The area 18-projection zone stretches as a central cone into the posterior pulvinar through PuL and into PuM. It is surrounded by the projection zone to the posterior belt of area 19 and this in turn is surrounded by the projection zone to the anterior belt of area 19. The projection zones to area 19 are then surrounded medially and dorsally by zones projectiong to the temporal and parietal association cortex, respectively. The projection zone to area MT is located medio-ventrally in the posterior pulvinar (PuIP and surrounding nuclei) and coincides with a densely myelinated region. Area 17 also receives input from the pulvinar but probably predominantly in the region of the central visual field. The pulvinar zone projecting to area 17 is located ventrolaterally from the central core region projecting to area 18 and is contiguous laterally with the LGN. If the positions of the vertical and the horizontal meridian in the pulvinar correspond to those in the respective cortical projection zones, a second order visual field representation such as found in area 18, with the horizontal meridian split at an excentricity of about 7-10-degrees, can also be recognized in the pulvinar.;MAX PLANCK INST BIOPHYS CHEM, DEPT NEUROBIOL, POB 2841, W-3400 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY;Max Planck Society;;;;;;;;;66;35;35;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

However, there is relatively little evidence detailing the interactions between mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex linked to cognition in primates. This study investigated these interactions during learning, memory, and decision-making tasks in rhesus monkeys using a disconnection lesion approach. Preoperatively, monkeys learned object-in-place scene discriminations embedded within colorful visual backgrounds. Unilateral neurotoxic lesions to magnocellular mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impaired the ability to learn new object-in-place scene discriminations. In contrast, unilateral ablations to ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex (PFv+o) left learning intact. A second unilateral MDmc or PFv+o lesion in the contralateral hemisphere to the first operation, causing functional MDmc-PFv+o disconnection across hemispheres, further impaired learning object-in-place scene discriminations, although object discrimination learning remained intact. Adaptive decision-making after reward satiety devaluation was also reduced. These data highlight the functional importance of interactions between MDmc and PFv+o during learning object-in-place scene discriminations and adaptive decision-making but not object discrimination learning. Moreover, learning deficits observed after unilateral removal of MDmc but not PFv+o provide direct behavioral evidence of the MDmc role influencing more widespread regions of the frontal lobes in cognition.;"[Browning, Philip G.

Multiple retrograde tracers were placed into V1, V2, V4, and/or MT in 11 adult macaque monkeys. The inferior pulvinar (PI) was subdivided into medial (PIM), posterior (PIP), central medial (PICM), and central lateral (PICL) regions, confirming earlier CB studies. The P-1 map includes PICL and the ventromedial portion of the lateral pulvinar (PL), P-2 is found in ventrolateral PL, and P-3 includes PIP, PIM, and PICM. Projections to areas V1 and V2 were found to be overlapping in P-1 and P-2, but those from P-2 to V2 were denser than those to V1. V2 also received light projections from PICM and, less reliably, from PIM. Neurons projecting to V4 and MT were more abundant than those projecting to V1 and V2. Those projecting to V4 were observed in P-1, densely in P-2, and also in PICM and PIP of P-3. Those projecting to MT were found in P-1-P-3, with the heaviest projection from P-3. Projections from P-3 to MT and V4 were mainly interdigitated, with the densest to MT arising from PIM and the densest to V4 arising from PIP and PICM. Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P-3 corresponded to differential patterns of cortical connectivity, the results suggest that CB may further delineate functional subdivisions in the pulvinar.

To optimize this approach, we proposed to study the involvement of this nucleus in a non-human primate model of mesial temporal lobe seizure. Two macaques were implanted with one chronic electrode into the hippocampus allowing to monitor the ictal activity. Neurons of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus were recorded with a microelectrode inserted acutely. To induce seizures, penicillin was injected into the hippocampus and neuronal activities of the anterior nucleus were analyzed during ictal and interictal periods. The effects of the chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus on the ictal hippocampal activities were studied and electron microscopy analysis was carried out to study morphological modifications induced in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results demonstrate that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is directly involved in the pathophysiology of induced seizures since: (1) Electrophysiological study showed an heterogenous excitation during seizure characterized by the appearance of 2 types of neuronal firing response; (2) chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus changed the severity of seizures; (3) morphological modification of the ultrastructure as well as a reduction of synapse density were observed within the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This study demonstrates that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the epileptic network activated during temporal lobe seizures and suggests that this nucleus would be valid target for seizure control using deep brain stimulation.

Brain tissue from macaques was immunoreacted by means of antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to histamine and processed for light and electron microscopy. A dense plexus of thin, highly branched ChAT-immunoreactive axons laden with varicosities was found in all layers of the dLGN including the koniocellular laminae and in the pregeniculate nucleus. ChAT label was more dense in magnocellular layers 1 and 2 than in parvocellular layers 3-6 and relatively sparse in the interlaminar zones. Varicosities associated with the cholinergic axons had an average of three conventional asymmetric synapses per varicosity, and these appeared to contact dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons. Histamine-immunoreactive axons were distributed homogeneously throughout all laminar and interlaminar zones of the dLGN, but mere denser in the pregeniculate nucleus than in the dLGN. Histaminergic axons branched infrequently and were typically larger in caliber than cholinergic axons. The overwhelming majority of varicosities were found en passant and rarely displayed conventional synapses, despite the abundance of synaptic vesicles, and were not associated preferentially with specific cellular structures. The innervation of the macaque dLGN complex by cholinergic and histaminergic systems is consistent with their proposed role in state dependent modulation of thalamic activity. The dense and highly synaptic innervation by cholinergic axons supports the proposal of additional involvement of these axons in functions related to eye movements. Anat Rec 255:295-305, 1999.

The primate thalamus is densely and heterogeneously innervated with dopaminergic axons, most of which express the dopamine transporter, as does the nigrostriatal system. We hypothesized that dopamine depletion may be present in the thalamus of the parkinsonian brain and set out to ascertain possible regional differences. Methods The toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was administered to adult macaque monkeys using a slow intoxication protocol. The treated macaques were classified into 2 groups according to their motor status: nonsymptomatic and parkinsonian. Dopamine innervation was studied with immunohistochemistry for the dopamine transporter. Topographic maps of the dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon distribution were generated and the total length and length density of these axons stereologically estimated using a 3-dimensional fractionator. Results Parkinsonian macaques exhibited lower dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density than controls in mediodorsal and centromedian-parafascicular nuclei. Dopamine denervation in the mediodorsal nucleus was already noticeable in nonsymptomatic macaques and was even greater in parkinsonian macaques. Reticular nucleus dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density presented an inverse pattern, increasing progressively to the maximum density seen in parkinsonian macaques. No changes were observed in ventral thalamic nuclei. Dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon maps supported the quantitative findings. Conclusions Changes in the dopamine innervation of various thalamic nuclei are heterogeneous and start in the premotor parkinsonian stage. These changes may be involved in some poorly understood nonmotor manifestations of PD. (c) 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society;"[Monje, Mariana H.

The locations of injection sites and resulting labeled neurons were further determined by relating sections processed to reveal tracers to those processed for myeloarchitecture in the cortex and multiple architectural stains in the thalamus. The ventroposterior medial subnucleus (VPM) for touch was identified as separate from the ventroposterior medial parvicellular nucleus (VPMpc) for taste by differential expression of several types of proteins. Our results revealed somatotopically matched projections from VPM to the part of 3b representing intra-oral structures and the face. Retrogradely labeled cells resulting from injections in area 3b were also found in other thalamic nuclei including: anterior pulvinar (Pa), ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior superior (VPS), ventroposterior lateral (VPL), ventral lateral (VL), center median (CM), central lateral (CL), and medial dorsal (MD). None of our injections, including those into the representation of the tongue, labeled neurons in VPMpc, the thalamic taste nucleus. Thus, area 3b does not appear to be involved in processing taste information from the thalamus. This result stands in contrast to those reported for New World monkeys. J. Comp.

Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.;"[Magrou, Loic; Giroud, Pascale; Berland, Michel; Knoblauch, Kenneth; Dehay, Colette; Kennedy, Henry] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, U1208,Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst, F-69500 Bron, France; [Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Barone, Pascal] CNRS, UMR 5549, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31059 Toulouse, France; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Killackey, Herbert P.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Kennedy, Henry] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Princeton University; Princeton University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Chinese Academy of Sciences";"Dehay, C; Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, U1208,Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst, F-69500 Bron, France.;Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.";"colette.dehay@inserm.fr; henry.kennedy@inserm.fr";"Kennedy, Henry/B-9636-2013; Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009; Knoblauch, Kenneth/H-8156-2014; Markov, Nikola T./AFO-2802-2022; Dehay, Colette/H-4437-2014; Markov, Nikola/AAI-9680-2020";"Kennedy, Henry/0000-0002-2796-7663; Barone, Pascal/0000-0003-0125-7468; Knoblauch, Kenneth/0000-0002-4681-4638; Markov, Nikola T./0000-0003-1417-1161; Dehay, Colette/0000-0002-5196-1464; ";"LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; CORE-NETS [ANR-11-BSV4-501]; ARCHI-CORE [ANR-14-CE13-0033]; CORNET [ANR-15-CE32-0016]; CORTICITY [ANR-17-HBPR-0003];  [ANR-17-NEUC-0004];  [A2P2MC]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-HBPR-0003] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)";"LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon; CORE-NETS; ARCHI-CORE; CORNET; CORTICITY; ; ; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042) of Universite de Lyon (ANR-11-IDEX-0007) operated by the French National Research Agency (ANR) (H.K.), ANR-11-BSV4-501, CORE-NETS (H.K.), ANR-14-CE13-0033, ARCHI-CORE (H.K.), ANR-15-CE32-0016, CORNET (H.K.), ANR-17-NEUC-0004, A2P2MC (H.K.), ANR-17-HBPR-0003, CORTICITY (H.K.).;;122;13;13;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Nonhuman primate studies have highlighted the crucial role of the cerebellum for saccade adaptation, but its neural substrates in humans are poorly understood. Recent physiological experiments suggest that, in addition to cerebellar structures, cortical areas may be involved as well. We have therefore hypothesized that saccade adaptation may rely on a cerebello-cerebral network, in which the cerebellar thalamus may link cerebellar and cerebral structures. To test this hypothesis, we studied saccade adaptation in a group of four patients with a thalamic lesion, with (n=2) or without (n=2) involvement of the cerebellar thalamus. Compared to healthy subjects, saccade adaptation was reduced in patients with associated cerebellar syndrome, but normal in patients without cerebellar syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cerebello-thalamic pathways contribute to saccade adaptation in humans and suggest that the thalamus relays adaptation-related information from the cerebellum to cerebral cortical oculomotor areas.;"Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, F-75651 Paris 13, France; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Explorat Fonct Syst Nerveux, Paris, France; Humboldt Univ, Charite, Neurol Klin, Berlin, Germany";"Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Gaymard, B (corresponding author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, 47 Bd Hop, F-75651 Paris 13, France.;gaymard@ccr.jussieu.fr;Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013;"Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530; YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X";;;;;53;50;50;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Most LGN neurons are monocular in that they are activated by visual stimulation through only one (dominant) eye. However, there are both intrinsic connections and inputs from binocular structures to the LGN that could provide these neurons with signals originating from the other (non-dominant) eye. Indeed, previous work introducing luminance differences across the eyes or using a single-contrast stimulus showed binocular modulation for single unit activity in anesthetized macaques and multiunit activity in awake macaques. Here, we sought to determine the influence of contrast viewed by both the non-dominant and dominant eyes on LGN single-unit responses in awake macaques. To do this, we adjusted each eye's signal strength by independently varying the contrast of stimuli presented to the two eyes. Specifically, we recorded LGN single unit spiking activity in two awake macaques while they viewed drifting gratings of varying contrast. We found that LGN neurons of all types [parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K)] were significantly suppressed when stimuli were presented at low contrast to the dominant eye and at high contrast to the non-dominant eye. Further, the inputs of the two eyes showed antagonistic interaction, whereby the magnitude of binocular suppression diminished with high contrast in the dominant eye, or low contrast in the non-dominant eye. These results suggest that the LGN represents a site of precortical binocular processing involved in resolving discrepant contrast differences between the eyes.;"[Dougherty, Kacie; Carlson, Brock M.; Cox, Michele A.; Westerberg, Jacob A.; Zinke, Wolf; Maier, Alexander] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr,Ctr Integrat & Cognit Neur, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Dougherty, Kacie] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 09540 USA; [Cox, Michele A.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14620 USA; [Schmid, Michael C.] Univ Fribourg, Fac Sci & Med, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Integrat Br, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Schmid, Michael C.] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Fac Med Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England";"Vanderbilt University; Princeton University; University of Rochester; University of Fribourg; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";"Dougherty, K (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr,Ctr Integrat & Cognit Neur, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Dougherty, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 09540 USA.";kacied@princeton.edu;"Maier, Alexander/B-7489-2009; Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009; Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020; Westerberg, Jacob/Q-5989-2016";"Maier, Alexander/0000-0002-7250-502X; Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X; zinke, wolf/0000-0001-5525-5973; Dougherty, Kacie/0000-0001-6295-0026; Cox, Michele A/0000-0002-6822-6503; Carlson, Brock/0000-0003-4846-099X; Westerberg, Jacob/0000-0001-5331-8707";"National Eye Institute [1R01EY027402-03]; National Eye Institute Training Grant [5T32EY007135-23, 1F31EY031293-22]; National Institute of Mental Health Training Grant [5T32MH065214-17]; European Research Council [OptoVision 637638]";"National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Eye Institute Training Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Institute of Mental Health Training Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC))";This work was supported by the National Eye Institute Grant 1R01EY027402-03 and the National Eye Institute Training Grant 5T32EY007135-23 (to J.A.W. and K.D.), the National Institute of Mental Health Training Grant 5T32MH065214-17 (to K.D.), and National Eye Institute Training Grant 1F31EY031293-22 (to J.A.W.).

Activated macrophages and microglia in white matter along with the hallmark multinucleated giant cells are prominent features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and of several simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) models. While infected microglia have been demonstrated in HIVE, this feature is not routinely seen in experimental infections in rhesus macaques using SIV or chimeric simian/HIV (SHIV) strains, limiting utility in HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment studies. Here, 50 rhesus macaques were inoculated with the CCR5 (R5)-tropic SHIVSF162P3N virus by one of three routes: intravenously (n = 9), intrarectally (n = 17), or intravaginally (n = 24). Forty-three monkeys became viremic, 26 developed AIDS, and 7 (7/26, 27 %) developed giant cell SIV encephalitis (SIVE). Rapid progressor phenotype was evident in five of seven (71 %) macaques with SIVE, and expansion to utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 coreceptor switch) was observed in four out of seven (57 %). SIVE lesions were present in gray and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, and brain stem of affected animals. Lesions were composed of virally infected CD68(+), CD163(+), and HLA-DR+ macrophages accompanied by white matter damage, necrosis, and astroglial and microglial activation. Importantly, microglial infection was observed, which makes R5 SHIVSF162P3N infection of macaques an attractive animal model not only to study transmission and HIVE pathogenesis but also to conduct preclinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating HIV-1 from the central nervous system (CNS).;"[Harbison, Carole; Knight, Heather; Westmoreland, Susan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Med & Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [Zhuang, Ke; Gettie, Agegnehu; Cheng-Mayer, Cecilia] Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Blanchard, James; Didier, Peter] Tulane Univ, Med Ctr, Tulane Natl Primate Res Ctr, Covington, LA USA";"Harvard University; Tulane University";Westmoreland, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Med & Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.;Susan_westmoreland@hms.harvard.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [R01AI46980]; Tulane National Primate Research Center Base grant [RR00164]; New England Primate Research Center Base grant [P51OD011103-51]; National Institutes of Health T32 training grant [T32OD011064]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Tulane National Primate Research Center Base grant; New England Primate Research Center Base grant; National Institutes of Health T32 training grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant R01AI46980 (CCM).

We examined the topography of pulvinar projections to these two cortical regions by placing multiple injections of different tracers (fluorescent dyes, horseradish peroxidase) in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of macaque monkeys. The patterns of label observed after injections in inferotemporal gyrus indicate that area TEO and the ventral part of area V4 receive a major input from the ventral part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLv) while area TE has strong connections with the caudal pole of the medial pulvinar (PuM) and only minor connections with PuLv. In contrast, injections in the caudal inferior parietal cortex demonstrate that area PGc, on the lateral surface of the inferior parietal gyrus, and area POa, in the ventral bank of intraparietal sulcus, receive strong projections from PuM and the adjacent fringe of the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLd). Paired injections of two different tracers in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of the same hemisphere revealed a nearly complete segregation of the two populations of labeled neurons in the pulvinar, with only a small region of overlap in PuM, close to the PuM/PuLd border. These results demonstrate a clear separation of the thalamic afferents to the inferior parietal and inferotemporal cortex which parallels the separation of prestriate afferents to these two cortical territories (Morel & Bullier, 1990).;;;BALEYDIER, C (corresponding author), INSERM, U94, 16 AVE DOYEN LEPINE, F-69500 BRON, FRANCE.;;;;;;;;78;76;76;0;3;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;MAY;1992;8;5;;;;;391;405;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800004922;;;15;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";HQ063;1375095;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1992HQ06300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this knowledge gap, we examined serially sectioned cholinergic axons in supra- and infragranular layers of the macaque prefrontal cortex by using an antibody against the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The tissue bound antibody was visualized with both immunoperoxidase and silver-enhanced diaminobenzidine sulfide (SEDS) techniques. Both methods revealed that cholinergic axons make synapses in all cortical layers and that these synapses are exclusively symmetric. Cholinergic axons formed synapses primarily on dendritic shafts (70.5%), dendritic spines (25%), and, to a lesser extent, cell bodies (4.5%). Both pyramidal neurons and cells exhibiting the morphological features of GABAergic cells were targets of the cholinergic innervation. Some spiny dendritic shafts received multiple, closely spaced synapses, suggesting that a subset of pyramidal neurons may be subject to a particularly strong cholinergic influence. Analysis of synaptic incidence of cholinergic profiles in the supragranular layers of the prefrontal cortex by the SEDS technique revealed that definitive synaptic junctions were formed by 44% of the cholinergic boutons. An unexpected finding was that cholinergic boutons were frequently apposed to spines and small dendrites without making any visible synaptic specializations. These same spines and dendrites often received asymmetric synapses, presumably of thalamocortical or corticocortical origin. Present ultrastructural findings suggest that acetylcholine may have a dual modulatory effect in the neocortex: one through classical synaptic junctions on dendritic shafts and spines, and the other through nonsynaptic appositions in close vicinity to asymmetric synapses. Further physiological studies are necessary to test the hypothesis of the nonsynaptic release of acetylcholine in the cortex.

The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation. The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions. Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere-the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated. There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion. This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere. The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric nystagmus or perceived body motion. Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways. Furthermore, the normal interaction between the two sensory systems-the vestibular and the visual-appears to be impaired.";"Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Nucl Med, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; Univ Munich, Dept Neurol, D-8000 Munich, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Dept Nucl Med, D-8000 Munich, Germany";"Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Munich";Dieterich, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.;dieterich@neurologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de;;schwaiger, markus/0000-0002-2305-7144;;;;;65;72;74;1;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;SEP;2005;128;;9;;;;2052;2067;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awh551;;;16;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;961XC;15947061;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000231694100011;View Full Record in Web of Science

The experimental groups of pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were spayed controls (n = 4), estrogen treated (28 days, n = 4) and estrogen + progesterone-treated animals (14 days estrogen + 14 days estrogen and progesterone, n = 4). Monkey specific 5HT1A (432 bp), 2A (411 bp) and 2C (294 bp) receptor probes were generated with PCR. Moderate 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal was detected in the preoptic area and the ventromedial nuclei. Less intense 5HT1A receptor signal was detected in a contiguous area from the dorsomedial nuclei through the posterior hypothalamus and in the supramammillary area. There was no change in 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. Dense 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal was morphologically confined to the paraventricular, supraoptic, and mammillary nuclei and the external capsule of the thalamus. Light 5HT2A mRNA signal was inconsistently observed in the ventromedial nuclei. There was no change in the 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. The 5HT2C receptor mRNA was widely distributed in the macaque hypothalamus. The preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus were largely positive for 5HT2C mRNA with a more concentrated signal in a narrow periventricular area. Dense 5HT2C receptor signal was detected lateral to the ventromedial nuclei (capsule), in the tuberomammillary nuclei, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nuclei, infundibular area and choroid plexus. Moderate 5HT2C receptor signal was detected in the ventromedial nuclei, lateral hypothalamus and dorsal to posterior hypothalamus. There was a significant decrease in total 5HT2C mRNA hybridization signal with ovarian steroid treatment in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. In summary, macaque 5HT1A, 2A and 2C receptor mRNAs are located in distinct hypothalamic loci which play a role in a number of autonomic functions and behavior. Ovarian steroids decreased the expression of 5HT2C receptor mRNA in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. The expression of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptor mRNA was not altered by treatment with ovarian steroids. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two subjects alternated between periods of making saccades and central fixations while blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images were collected [3 T, (1.5 mm)(3) spatial resolution]. BOLD activations from each of four cerebral hemispheres were projected onto the subjects' cortical surfaces and aligned to a surface-based atlas for comparison across hemispheres and subjects. This surface-based analysis revealed patterns of visuo-oculomotor activity across much of the cerebral cortex, including activations in the posterior parietal cortex, superior temporal cortex and frontal lobe. For each cortical domain, we show the anatomical position and extent of visuo-oculomotor activity, including evidence that the dorsolateral frontal activation, which includes the frontal eye field (on the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus), extends anteriorly into posterior principal sulcus (area 46) and posteriorly into part of dorsal premotor cortex (area 6). Our results also suggest that subcortical BOLD activity in the pulvinar thalamus may be lateralized during voluntary eye movements.

To assist our understanding of this issue, we have compared the anatomical distribution of V1 intrinsic relays that carry information derived from magno- (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus between thalamic recipient neurons and interareal efferent neuron groups within area V1. We used small, iontophoretic injections of biocytin placed in individual cortical laminae of area V1 to trace orthograde and retrograde inter- and intralaminar projections. In either the same or adjacent sections, the tissue was reacted for cytochrome oxidase (CO), which provides important landmarks for different efferent neuron populations located in CO rich blobs and CO poor interblobs in laminae 2/3, as well as defining clear boundaries for the populations of efferent neurons in laminae 4A and 4B. This study shows that the interblobs, but not the blobs, receive direct input from thalamic recipient 4C neurons; the interblobs receive relays from mid 4C neurons (believed to receive convergent M and P inputs), while blobs receive indirect inputs from either M or P (or both) pathways through layers 4B (which receives M relays from layer 4C alpha) and 4A (which receives P relays directly from the thalamus as well as from layer 4C beta). The property of orientation selectivity, most prominent in the interblob regions and in layer 4B, may have a common origin from oriented lateral projections made by mid 4C spiny stellate neurons. While layer 4B efferents may emphasize M characteristics and layer 4A efferents emphasize P characteristics, the dendrites of their constituent pyramidal neurons may provide anatomical access to the other channel since both blob and interblob regions in layers 2/3 have anatomical access to M and P driven relays, despite functional differences in the way these properties may be expressed in the two compartments.";"UNIV LONDON,INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT VISUAL SCI,LONDON EC1V 9EL,ENGLAND; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,KRIEGER MIND BRAIN INST,BALTIMORE,MD";"University of London; University College London; Johns Hopkins University";;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY10021, EYO5282, EYO6275] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;39;114;115;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;MAY-JUN;1994;11;3;;;;;467;489;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800002406;;;23;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";NH296;8038123;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1994NH29600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Reorganization results in expansion of intact chin inputs, which reactivate neurons in the deafferented hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b), ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. A likely contributing mechanism for this large-scale plasticity is sprouting of axons across the hand-face border. Here we determined whether such sprouting takes place in area 3b. We first determined the extent of intrinsic corticocortical connectivity between the hand and the face representations in normal area 3b. Small amounts of neuroanatomical tracers were injected in these representations close to the electrophysiologically determined hand-face border. Locations of the labeled neurons were mapped with respect to the detailed electrophysiological somatotopic maps and histologically determined hand-face border revealed in sections of the flattened cortex stained for myelin. Results show that intracortical projections across the hand-face border are few. In monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns and expanded chin representation, connections across the hand-face border were not different compared with normal monkeys. Thalamocortical connections from the hand and face representations in the ventroposterior nucleus to area 3b also remained unaltered after injury. The results show that sprouting of intrinsic connections in area 3b or the thalamocortical inputs does not contribute to large-scale cortical plasticity.;"[Chand, Prem; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8,Nainwal Rd, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010; Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012";"Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Government of India [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-I]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Research Associate Fellowship";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant; National Brain Research Centre; Government of India; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Research Associate Fellowship";"This work was supported by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012 to N.J. and National Brain Research Centre core funds.

Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and neighboring regions of IT cortex. Here, we used fMRI to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in four monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene versus face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.;"[Arcaro, Michael J.; Livingstone, Margaret S.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Arcaro, XJ (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;michael_arcaro@hms.harvard.edu;Arcaro, Michael/H-8964-2019;"Arcaro, Michael/0000-0002-4612-9921; Livingstone, Margaret/0000-0002-1950-0123";"NIH [R01 EY 25670, P30 EY 12196, F32 EY 24187]; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Institutes of Health; William Randolph Hearst Fellowship; NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant [S10RR021110]";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); William Randolph Hearst Fellowship; NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This work was supported by NIH Grants R01 EY 25670, P30 EY 12196, and F32 EY 24187 and performed in part at the Athinoula A.

In Old World monkeys, rostral and caudal aspects of the hand representation are located in the precentral gyrus and the anterior bank of the central sulcus, respectively. We previously reported the organization of the cortico-cortical connections of the grasp zone in rostral M1. Here we describe the organization of thalamocortical connections that were labeled from the same tracer injections. Thalamocortical connections of a grasp zone in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the M1 orofacial representation are included for direct comparison. The M1 grasp zone was primarily connected with ventral lateral divisions of motor thalamus. The largest proportion of inputs originated in the posterior division (VLp) followed by the medial and the anterior divisions. Thalamic inputs to the M1 grasp zone originated in more lateral aspects of VLp as compared to the origins of thalamic inputs to the M1 orofacial representation. Inputs to M1 from thalamic divisions connected with cerebellum constituted three fold the density of inputs from divisions connected with basal ganglia, whereas the ratio of inputs was more balanced for the grasp zone in PMv. Privileged access of the cerebellothalamic pathway to the grasp zone in rostral M1 is consistent with the connection patterns previously reported for the precentral gyrus. Thus, cerebellar nuclei are likely more involved than basal ganglia nuclei with the contributions of rostral M1 to manual dexterity.;"[Gharbawie, Omar A.; Stepniewska, Iwona; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Gharbawie, Omar A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Syst Neurosci Inst, Dept Neurobiol,Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Gharbawie, Omar A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, 3501 Fifth Ave,4069 BST 3, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";"Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Syst Neurosci Inst, Dept Neurobiol,Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, 3501 Fifth Ave,4069 BST 3, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.";omar@pitt.edu;;;"CIHR Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY002686] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [U54 HD083211] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R00 NS079471, K99 NS079471, R03 NS055843] Funding Source: Medline";"CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;49;1;1;1;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we developed and characterized a macaque model of CPSP. The location of the VPL was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation, after which a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Immunohistochemistry revealed that microglial and astrocytic activation in the perilesional areas lasted at least 3 months after injection. The present model reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Further, the long- lasting glial activation revealed here may be characteristic of primate brains following injury. The present model will be useful not only for examining the neurological changes underlying CPSP, but also for testing therapeutic interventions for CPSP.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tsukuba";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016; Matsuda, Keiji/N-2784-2016; Higo, Noriyuki/M-6385-2016";"Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Matsuda, Keiji/0000-0003-2529-0019; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316; Higo, Noriyuki/0000-0002-3448-1696";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [25351004, 16K01489]; MEXT of Japan [17H05917]; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); PRESTO of Japanese Science and Technology Agency;  [17J03104]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25351004, 17H05917, 16K01489, 17J03104] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)); PRESTO of Japanese Science and Technology Agency; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";We are grateful to Mr. T.

In this work, a complete characterization of NA axons and Alpha adrenoceptors distributions is provided. NA axons, revealed by immunohistochemistry against the synthesizing enzyme and the NA transporter, are present in all thalamic nuclei. The most densely innervated ones are the midline nuclei, intralaminar nuclei (paracentral and parafascicular), and the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDm). The ventral motor nuclei and most somatosensory relay nuclei receive a moderate NA innervation. The pulvinar complex receives a heterogeneous innervation. The lateral geniculate nucleus (GL) has the lowest NA innervation. Alpha adrenoceptors were analyzed by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Alpha-1 receptor densities are higher than Alpha-2 densities. Overall, axonal densities and Alpha adrenoceptor densities coincide; although some mismatches were identified. The nuclei with the highest Alpha-1 values are MDm, the parvocellular part of the ventral posterior medial nucleus, medial pulvinar, and midline nuclei. The nucleus with the lowest Alpha-1 receptor density is GL. Alpha-2 receptor densities are highest in the lateral dorsal, centromedian, medial and inferior pulvinar, and midline nuclei.

We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neuron's receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a response vector whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19-26%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 +/- 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response.";SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo";Bender, DB (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, 329 Cary Hall, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.;;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY-02254] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-32936] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;92;76;78;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Many of these maps are arranged in a discontinuous or patchy manner. Similarly, thalamocortical projections arising from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body to the primary auditory cortex are also patchy. We used anterograde labeling and electrophysiological methods to examine the relationship between thalamocortical patches and auditory cortical maps. Biotinylated dextran-amine was deposited into physiologically characterized sites in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of New Zealand white rabbits. Approximately 7 d later, the animal was again anesthetized and the ipsilateral auditory cortex was mapped with tungsten microelectrodes. Multi-unit physiological data were obtained for the following characteristics: best frequency (BF), binaurality, response type, latency, sharpness of tuning, and threshold. Immunocytochemical methods were used to reveal the injection site in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body as well as the anterogradely labeled thalamocortical afferents in the auditory cortex. In 86% of the cases (12 of 14), entry into a thalamocortical patch was associated with a marked change in physiological responses. A consistent BF and binaural class were usually observed within a patch. The patches appear to innervate distinct functional regions coding frequency and binaurality.

Labeled cells and terminals in the thalamus resulting from the injections were related to architectonic boundaries. As in previous studies in primates, the hand representation of area 3b has dense, restricted projections predominantly from the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus (VPl). Projections to area 1 were highly convergent from several thalamic nuclei including the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), anterior pulvinar (PA), VPl, and the superior division of the ventral posterior nucleus (VPs). In cortex immediately caudal to area 1, what we term area 5, thalamocortical connections were also highly convergent and predominantly from nuclei of the thalamus associated with motor, visual, or somatic processing such as VL, the medial pulvinar (PM), and PA, respectively; with moderate projections from VP, central lateral nucleus (CL), lateral posterior nucleus (LP), and VPs. Finally, thalamocortical connections of area 7b/AIP were from a range of nuclei including PA, PM, LP/LD, VL, CL, PL, and CM. The current data support two conclusions drawn from previous studies in titi monkeys and other primates. First, cortex caudal to area 1 in New World monkeys is more like area 5 than area 2. Second, the presence of thalamic input to area 5 from both motor nuclei and somatosensory nuclei of the thalamus, suggests that area 5 could be considered a highly specialized sensorimotor area.";"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Krubitzer, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;lakrubitzei@ucdavis.edu;;;"NEI NIH HHS [F32 EY014503-01A1] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS35103-07] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;77;11;11;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

To further understand chemokine receptors in the brain and explore their potential role in HIV neuropathogenesis, particularly in pediatrics, we examined the regional and cellular distribution of CCR5 and CXCR4 in normal fetal, neonatal, and adult rhesus macaques. CCR5 and CXCR4 were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence within the cytoplasm of subpopulations of neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum and by flow cytometry on the surface of neurons and glia. Interestingly, expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 increased significantly (p<0.05) from birth to 9 months of age. We further characterize this dynamic developmental pattern of CCR5 and CXCR4 expression in resident cells of the CNS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The vestibular sensors in the inner ear detect self-motion and in turn send projections via the vestibular nuclei to multiple cortical areas through 2 principal thalamocortical pathways, 1 anterior and 1 posterior. While the anterior pathway has been extensively studied, the role of the posterior pathway is not well understood. Accordingly, here we recorded responses from individual neurons in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus of macaque monkeys during externally applied (passive) and actively generated self-motion. The sensory responses of neurons that robustly encoded passive rotations and translations were canceled during comparable voluntary movement (similar to 80% reduction). Moreover, when both passive and active self-motion were experienced simultaneously, neurons selectively encoded the detailed time course of the passive component. To examine the mechanism underlying the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active motion, we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement. We found that suppression only occurred if the actual sensory consequences of motion matched the motor-based expectation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the posterior thalamocortical vestibular pathway selectively encodes unexpected motion, thereby providing a neural correlate for ensuring perceptual stability during active versus externally generated motion.;"[Dale, Alexis; Cullen, Kathleen E.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada";McGill University;Cullen, KE (corresponding author), McIntyre Med Bldg,Room 1219, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.;kathleen.cullen@mcgill.ca;;;"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health [R01-DC002390, R01-DC009255, R01-DC013069]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research";"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))";The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health (grants R01-DC002390, R01-DC009255, and R01-DC013069 to K.E.C.) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.;;78;22;22;1;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Most terminal boutons were small (< 1mum), except some large boutons (2-6 mum) located in PO and vMGB. The data demonstrate that the corticothalamic projection from A1 in primate consists of two types of terminals (small and giant endings) in line with previous observations in rat and cat.

Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.;"[Afrasiabi, Mohsen; Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Phillips, Jessica M.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Mohanta, Sounak; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Raz, Aeyal] Rambam Hlth Care Campus, Dept Anesthesiol, IL-3109601 Haifa, Israel; [Raz, Aeyal] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Haun, Andrew M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53705 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Rambam Health Care Campus; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";"Afrasiabi, M; Redinbaugh, MJ; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53705 USA.";"afrasiabi@wisc.edu; mredinbaugh@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021; Haun, Andrew M/I-4956-2012; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023";"Haun, Andrew M/0000-0001-9458-8957; Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698";"NIH [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; BSF [201732]; WNPRC pilot grant";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); WNPRC pilot grant";We thank the Tononi, Cirelli, and Banks Labs and D.

The labelled neurones were located in the lateral half of the posterior one-third of the dLGN and predominated in the interlaminar zones or close to the borders of the parvocellular layers.

In this study, we characterized the native T-type calcium current underlying thalamic burst responses in the macaque monkey. Current clamp recordings from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) slices showed characteristic burst responses when relay cells were depolarized from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials. These bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of excitatory synaptic inputs to LGN cells. Under voltage clamp conditions, the inactivation kinetics of native currents recorded from primate LGN neurons showed consistency with T-type currents recorded in other mammals and in expression systems. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR performed on RNA isolated from the LGN (including tissues isolated from magnocellular and parvocellular laminae) detected voltage-dependent calcium channel (Ca-v) 3.1, Ca-v 3.2, and Ca-v 3.3 channel transcripts. Ca-v 3.1 occurred at relatively higher expression than other isoforms, consistent with in situ hybridization studies in rats, indicating that the molecular basis for burst firing in thalamocortical systems is an important conserved property of primate physiology. Since thalamic bursts have been observed during visual processing as well as in a number of CNS disorders, studies of the expression and modulation of these currents at multiple levels are critical for understanding their role in vision and for the discovery of new treatments for disruptions of thalamic rhythms.

To aid in functional and structural data analysis, we have created a comprehensive parcellation of the rhesus macaque subcortex using a high-resolution ex vivo structural imaging scan. This anatomical scan and its parcellation were warped to the updated NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2), an in vivo population template, where the parcellation was refined to produce the Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (SARM) with 210 primary regions-of-interest (ROIs). The subcortical parcellation and nomenclature reflect those of the 4th edition of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos et al., in preparation ), rather than proposing yet another novel atlas. The primary ROIs are organized across six spatial hierarchical scales from small, fine-grained ROIs to broader composites of multiple ROIs, making the SARM suitable for analysis at different resolutions and allowing broader labeling of functional signals when more accurate localization is not possible. As an example application of this atlas, we have included a functional localizer for the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus in three macaques using a visual flickering checkerboard stimulus, identifying and quantifying significant fMRI activation in this atlas region. The SARM has been made openly available to the neuroimaging community and can easily be used with common MRI data processing software, such as AFNI, where the atlas has been embedded into the software alongside cortical macaque atlases.;"[Hartig, Renee; Evrard, Henry C.] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Hartig, Renee; Logothetis, Nikos K.; Evrard, Henry C.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany; [Hartig, Renee] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Mannheim, Germany; [Glen, Daniel] NIMH, Sci & Stat Comp Core, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Jung, Benjamin] Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Jung, Benjamin; Messinger, Adam] NIMH, Lab Brain & Cognit, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Paxinos, George] Neurosci Res Australia, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia; [Paxinos, George] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia; [Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro, Mexico; [Evrard, Henry C.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Logothetis, Nikos K.; Evrard, Henry C.] Int Ctr Primate Brain Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China";"Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; Central Institute of Mental Health; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Brown University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Neuroscience Research Australia; University of New South Wales Sydney; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research";"Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany.;Messinger, A (corresponding author), NIMH, Lab Brain & Cognit, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Garza-Villarreal, EA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro, Mexico.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Int Ctr Primate Brain Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.";"egarza@comunidad.unam.mx; adam.messinger@nih.gov; Henry.Evrard@nki.rfmh.org";"Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo/A-7879-2008; Glen, Daniel/HCG-8456-2022";"Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo/0000-0003-1381-8648; Jung, Benjamin/0000-0002-8906-8452; Glen, Daniel/0000-0001-8456-5647; Messinger, Adam/0000-0002-8939-7897; Hartig, Renee/0000-0002-7734-8991; Evrard, Henry/0000-0001-8429-4699";"Max Planck Society; Intramural Research Program of the NIMH [ZIA MH002918, ZICMH002888]; NINDS [ZIA MH002918, ZICMH002888]";"Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); Intramural Research Program of the NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";EAGV would like to thank Gabriel A.

Here we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that project via the thalamus to area 46 of the prefrontal cortex of macaques in comparison with the projections to the primary motor cortex (M1). After rabies injections into area 46, many neurons in the restricted region of the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of PIN neurons labeled from the M1. This defines an anatomical substrate for the contribution of medial cerebellar output to cognitive functions.

In neurodegenerative disorders termed tauopathies, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular inclusions. Rhesus macaques are widely used for studying ageing processes and modeling neurodegenerative disorders, yet little is known about endogenous tau expression in their brains. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to map and characterize total tau, 3R- and 4R-tau isoforms, and phosphorylated tau (pThr231-tau and pSer202/Thr205-tau/AT8) expression bilaterally in 16 brain regions of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian adult rhesus macaques. Tau-immunoreactivity (-ir), including both 3R and 4R isoforms, was observed throughout the brain, with varying regional intensities. The anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus displayed the most robust tau-ir, while the subthalamic nucleus and white matter regions had minimal expression. Tau was present in neurons of gray matter regions; it was preferentially observed in fibers of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and in cell bodies of the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. In white matter regions, tau was abundantly present in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, neuronal pThr231-tau-ir was abundant in all brain regions, but not AT8-ir. Differences in regional and intracellular protein expression were not detected between control subjects and both brain hemispheres of MPTP-treated animals. Specifically, tau-ir in the substantia nigra of all subjects colocalized with GABAergic neurons. Overall, this report provides an in-depth characterization of tau expression in the rhesus macaque brain to facilitate future investigations for understanding and modeling tau pathology in this species.";"[Gambardella, Julia C.

One circuit originated from the neurochemical group of parvalbumin-positive thalamic neurons and projected focally through large terminals to the middle cortical layers, resembling 'drivers' in sensory pathways. Parvalbumin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by small 'modulatory' type cortical terminals, forming asymmetric (presumed excitatory) synapses at thalamic sites enriched with the specialized metabotropic glutamate receptors. A second circuit had a complementary organization: it originated from the neurochemical group of calbindin-positive thalamic neurons and terminated through small 'modulatory' terminals over long distances in the superficial prefrontal layers. Calbindin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by prefrontal axons through small and large terminals that formed asymmetric synapses preferentially at sites with ionotropic glutamate receptors, consistent with a driving pathway. The largely parallel thalamo-cortical pathways terminated among distinct and laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons that differ markedly in inhibitory control. The balance of activation of these parallel circuits that link a high-order association cortex with the thalamus may allow shifts to different states of consciousness, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.;"[Zikopoulos, Basilis; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832; Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104";"NIMH; NINDS";"NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";Supported by NIH grants from NIMH and NINDS.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years, rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models, a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models, cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover, some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models, a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore, we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys, the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter, a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models, the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore, the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months, such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently, brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore, the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.;"[Higo, Noriyuki; Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST);Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;;;;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN;TOKYO;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN, TOKYO, 00000, JAPAN;0915-8588;2187-4697;;PAIN RES;Pain Res.;;2018;33;4;;;;;275;281;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.11154/pain.33.275;;;7;Clinical Neurology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Neurosciences & Neurology;VI8AT;;gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000514199800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

In each monkey, different fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected separately into the distaI and proximal forelimb areas of the primary motor cortex after physiological mapping with intracortical microstimulation. In the same individual monkeys, an anterograde tracer, wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was injected into the internal segment of the globus pallidus after the forelimb part was identified physiologically. A small group of projection neurons to the distal and proximal representations of the motor cortex were found in the terminal fields from the pallidum, but a majority of the projection neurons were distributed outside the terminal area in the thalamus. These results confirm the existence of the pathway from the pallidum through the thalamus to the primary motor cortex, but also indicate that the primary motor cortex receives its major thalamic inputs from outside of the pallidal projection area, and that the pallidum sends its major outputs to nonprimary motor areas through the thalamus.

There are four families of glutamate receptors that can transduce this activity, as well as regulate glutamate release from thalamic relay neurons. The three ionotropic subtypes are of particular importance, because subunit composition confers variability in functional properties of each subtype. We have quantified the expression of NMDA. AMPA and kainate receptors in the thalamus of the macaque using receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization. NMDA receptors are: multimeric associations of NRL and NR2A-NR2D subunits that form ligand-gated ion channels. Particular subunits are associated with modulatory binding sites that affect receptor activity. NR1 was the most abundant subunit mRNA; NR2A, NR2B, and NR2D subunit mRNAs were also present, but were expressed in nucleus-specific patterns. Very high levels of [H-3]ifenprodil binding to the polyamine site of the NMDA complex were detected in a fairly homogenous distribution. Binding of the ion channel ligand [H-3]MK-801 was also abundant, and limbic nuclei expressed higher levels than motor nuclei or the reticular nucleus. [H-3]CGP39653 binding to the glutamate site of the NMDA receptor was the least abundant of the NMDA receptor binding sites. There was variability in the stoichiometric relationships of binding sites across nuclei, suggesting that there is heterogeneity in the pharmacological properties of NMDA receptors expressed in the thalamus. AMPA and kainate are also multimeric associations of specific: subunits that form ligand-gated ion channels. These subunits are encoded by specific genes: gluR1-gluR3 for AMPA receptors, and gluR5-gluR7 and KA1-KA2 fur kainate receptors. GluR4 and gluR6 mRNAs were, respectively the most abundant of the AMPA and kainate receptor subunit transcripts. Both AMPA and kainate receptor subunit transcripts were expressed in a nucleus-specific pattern. The binding of [H-3]kainate was higher than that of [H-3]AMPA throughout the thalamus, but AMPA subunit mRNA levels were three to five orders of magnitude higher than those encoding the kainate receptor subunits. The mismatch between the levels of expression of kainate receptor subunit transcripts and binding sites is suggestive of a presynaptic localization of kainate receptors on thalamic afferents. These results suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors are heterogeneously expressed in the thalamus of the primate, and that their differential expression is both subunit- and nucleus-specific, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BSI.

Inhibitory synaptic terminals in the VPL were defined as those that contain flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and that can be shown to be immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There are two types of these profiles: F axon terminals that arise from neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus, and perhaps from VPL local circuit neurons (LCNs); and the dendritic appendages of LCNs that form presynaptic dendrites (PSDs). ML terminals normally have extensive synaptic interactions with PSDs but not with F axon terminals. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that cuneatus lesions resulted in a rapid loss of ML terminals and a statistically significant reduction in both F and PSD synaptic profiles. Confocal scanning microscopy also demonstrated a profound loss of GABA immunoreactivity in the deafferented VPL. These changes persisted for more than 20 weeks, without any evidence of reactive synaptogenesis of surviving sensory afferents or of inhibitory synapses. The changes in GABA circuitry are transneuronal, and the possible mechanisms that may underlie them are discussed. It is suggested that the altered GABAergic circuitry of the VPL in the monkey may serve as a model for understanding changes in somatic sensation in the human following peripheral or central deafferentation.

We investigated the distribution of thalamocortical neurons projecting to forelimb representations of the SMA and the MI using a multiple retrograde labeling technique in the monkey. The forelimb area of the SMA, and the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI were identified by electrophysiological techniques of intracortical microstimulation and single neuron recording. Injections were made into these three representations with three different dyes in the same animal (horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin, diamidino yellow, and fast blue), and the thalamic neurons were retrogradely labeled. Injections into the SMA densely labeled thalamic neurons in nuclei ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo), ventralis lateralis pars medialis (VLm) and ventralis lateralis pars caudalis (VLc), but not in nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo). Injections into the MI labeled thalamic neurons primarily in VLo, VLc, and VPLo. We found that the distribution of projection neurons to the three areas was largely separate in the thalamus. However, in the middle part of VLo, and in a limited portion of VLc, thalamic neurons projecting to the SMA partially overlapped with those to the distal forelimb area of the MI. They overlapped little with those to the proximal forelimb area of the MI. We noted no overlap between the distributions of thalamic projection neurons to the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI. These findings suggest that the SMA. and MI receive separate information from the thalamus, while sharing minor sources of common inputs.

Studies already demonstrated that the pharmacological disinhibition of the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic GPe produced dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical regions altered by the disinhibition of each GPe functional territory. Thus, 5 macaques were injected with bicuculline in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic sites of the GPe producing dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, and underwent in vivo positron tomography with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to identify cortical dysfunctions related to GPe disinhibition. Blood cortisol levels were also quantified as a biomarker of anxiety for each condition. Our results showed that pallidal bicuculline injections in anesthetized animals reproducibly modified the activity of specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas depending on the pallidal territory targeted. Bicuculline injections in the limbic GPe led to increased ipsilateral activations in limbic cortical regions (anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). Injections in the associative vs. sensorimotor GPe increased the activity in the ipsilateral midcingulate vs. somatosensory and parietal cortices. Moreover, bicuculline injections increased blood cortisol levels only in animals injected in their limbic GPe. These are the first functional results supporting the model of opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops where modifications in a functional pallidal territory can impact cortical activities of the same functional territory but also cortical activities of other functional territories. This highlights the importance of the GPe as a crucial node in the top-down control of the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits from the frontal cortex to influence the perception, attention, and emotional processes at downstream (or non-frontal) cortical levels. Finally, we showed the implication of the ventral pallidum with the amygdala and the insular cortex in a circuit related to aversive processing that should be crucial for the production of anxious disorders.;"[Galineau, Laurent] Univ Tours, UMR INSERM U930, Tours, France; [Kas, Aurelie] UPMC Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Pitie Salpetriere Hop, AP HP,CNRS UMR 7371,INSERM U1146,Dept Nucl Med, F-75013 Paris, France; [Worbe, Yulia] UMPC Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Pitie Salpetriere Hop, Dept Neurol,ICM, F-75013 Paris, France; [Chaigneau, Marion; Herard, Anne-Sophie; Guillermier, Martine; Delzescaux, Thierry; Hantraye, Philippe] CEA UMR 9199, MIRCEN, 18 Route Panorama, F-92260 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Feger, Jean] UPMC Univ Paris 6, UMR S975, CRICM Ctr Rech Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France; [Tremblay, Leon] Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Neurosci Cognit, CNRS, UMR 5229, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Tours; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Hotel-Dieu - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Louis - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1";Tremblay, L (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Neurosci Cognit, CNRS, UMR 5229, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France.;leon.tremblay@isc.cnrs.fr;"Tremblay, Leon/H-1559-2017; Worbe, Yulia/GYV-3751-2022; HERARD, Anne-Sophie/K-5838-2013; Galineau, Laurent/P-8140-2016";"Tremblay, Leon/0000-0001-8370-6903; Worbe, Yulia/0000-0001-5903-9370; HERARD, Anne-Sophie/0000-0001-8260-9618; Galineau, Laurent/0000-0003-4960-1643";Agence Nationale de Recherche, France [ANR-05-NEUR-015-01];Agence Nationale de Recherche, France(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR));This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de Recherche, France (Grant number ANR-05-NEUR-015-01).;;82;10;10;0;10;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;Feb 01;2017;146;;;;;;1025;1037;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.039;;;13;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";EL3ZX;27989846;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000394560700089;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is becoming clear that given the same stress, some individuals are very vulnerable and will succumb to illness while others are more resilient and cope effectively, rather than becoming ill. This difference between individuals is called stress sensitivity. Stress sensitivity of an individual appears to be influenced by genetically inherited factors, early life (even prenatal) stress, and by the presence or absence of factors that provide protection from stress. In comparison to other stress-related diseases, the concept of sensitivity versus resilience to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction has received relatively little attention. The studies presented herein were undertaken to begin to identify stable characteristics and the neural underpinnings of individuals with sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction. Female cynomolgus macaques with normal menstrual cycles either stop ovulating (stress sensitive) or to continue to ovulate (stress resilient) upon exposure to a combined metabolic and psychosocial stress. However, even in the absence of stress, the stress-sensitive animals have lower secretion of the ovarian steroids, estrogen and progesterone, have higher heart rates, have lower serotonin function, have fewer serotonin neurons and lower expression of pivotal serotonin-related genes, have lower expression of 5HT2A and 2C genes in the hypothalamus, have higher gene expression of GAD67 and CRH in the hypothalamus, and have reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone transport to the anterior pituitary. Altogether, the results suggest that the neurobiology of reproductive circuits in stress-sensitive individuals is compromised. We speculate that with the application of stress, the dysfunction of these neural systems becomes exacerbated and reproductive function ceases.;"[Bethea, Cynthia L.; Centeno, Maria Luisa; Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Reprod Sci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Bethea, Cynthia L.; Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cameron, Judy L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";"Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon Health & Science University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Bethea, CL (corresponding author), Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Reprod Sci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.;betheac@ohsu.edu;Cameron, Judy L/J-6682-2013;Cameron, Judy/0000-0003-4707-4421;"Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD/NIH [U54 HD 18185]; Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research [NIH/MH62677, NIH/RR00163]";"Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD/NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research";"The authors are indebted to the Division of Animal Resources at ONPRC for the expert care of the animals and to the Department of Pathobiology for performing the necropsies.

GABA(B) transcript expression was widespread and of much higher density in the dorsal thalamus than in the reticular nucleus and other parts of the ventral thalamus and was highest in the epithalamus. In the dorsal thalamus, highest mRNA levels were found in the anteroventral nucleus and in the parafascicular nucleus. Sensory relay nuclei showed moderate GABA(B) mRNA levels. Neurons of all sizes mere labeled, suggesting expression in relay cells and interneurons, and there was no labeling of neuroglial cells. Following 10-day periods of monocular deprivation, levels of GABA(B) mRNA were decreased in the deprived magno- and parvo-cellular laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, indicating activity-dependent regulation. High levels of GABA(B) receptors in the dorsal thalamus are likely to reflect the high density of synaptic inputs from the reticular nucleus while low expression in the reticular nucleus implies weak, GABA(B)-mediated intrareticular inhibition.

Attention focused on the routes taken by these projections, which were delineated by combining surgical tract section with the placement of a tracer. Projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei almost exclusively used the fornix. These relatively light projections, which arose from all areas of the entorhinal cortex, from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and area 35 of the perirhinal cortex, terminated mainly in the anterior ventral nucleus. In contrast, the projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus from the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum were denser than those to the anterior thalamic nuclei. The projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus used two routes. While nearly all of the projections from the subicular complex used the fornix, many of the entorhinal cortex projections passed caudally in the temporopulvinar bundle to reach the lateral dorsal nucleus. The perirhinal cortex, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also projects to nucleus medialis dorsalis. These projections exclusively used the external capsule and thence the inferior thalamic peduncle. Other temporal-thalamic projections included those to the medial pulvinar, via the temporopulvinar bundle, from the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and those to the paraventricular nucleus from the entorhinal cortex. By identifying these routes, it is possible to appreciate how different lesions might disconnect temporal-diencephalic pathways and so contribute to memory disorders.;"Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;aggleton@cf.ac.uk;;Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308;;;;;73;82;83;0;5;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Injections of the anterograde tracer biocytin were made in the dorsal, associative region of the medial pallidum. Numerous axonal endings were observed within the pallidal territory of the lateral region of the thalamus and the central complex. Individual axons were reconstructed from serial sections and traced in three dimensions. Two axons made a collateral branch in the ventral part of the lateral region and ended in the central complex. In the pallidal territory of the lateral region, axons divided several times before ending in different parts of the territory in a 'bunch', a characteristic dense terminal arborization. Axonal endings in the central complex were differently organized.

The inferior pulvinar (PI) complex consisted of multiple subdivisions and encompassed the classic PI, and adjacent ventral parts of the lateral and medial pulvinar (PL and Phl, respectively). In keeping with nomenclature suggested previously for macaques, the PI subdivisions were termed the posterior, medial, central, lateral, and lateral-shell (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S). In both species, PIP was intense for calbindin, light for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and very light for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) histochemistry. The PIM was calbindin poor, AChE rich, and moderate for WFA. The PIC was calbindin intense, lighter for AChE, and exhibited little WFA binding. PIL and PIL-S contained populations of large calbindin or WFA cells that were more numerous in PIL-S. Although staining with the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 differed between macaques and squirrel monkeys, the same subdivisions were displayed, Moderately dense, patchy Cat-301 stain was found in PIM of macaques, whereas in squirrel monkeys PIM was Light. Connections of the rostral dorsolateral (DLr) and middle temporal (MT) areas of visual cortex in squirrel monkeys were compared with PI subdivisions revealed by the neu er histochemical methods in the same cases. The major connections of DLr were with PIC and of MT were with PIM.

Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement.

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas.

Sensory information is believed to then propagate through the cortical column along the L4 -> L2/3 -> L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent strata of cortex in parallel.;"[Bruno, Randy M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Columbia University; Columbia University";Bruno, RM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.;randybruno@columbia.edu;Bruno, Randy M./ABC-2117-2021;Bruno, Randy M./0000-0002-5122-4632;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH [NS069679]; Rita Allen Foundation; Klingenstein Fund; NSF Student Fellowship";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Rita Allen Foundation; Klingenstein Fund(Klingenstein Philanthropies); NSF Student Fellowship";"We thank L.

Using the Northern blot analysis, we investigated the developmental changes of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the thalamus of macaque monkeys. The amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was high at embryonic day 125, and decreased at postnatal day 1. It increased again at postnatal day 8, reached its peak value at postnatal days 50-70, and then decreased gradually until postnatal year 1. We previously reported that the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the cerebral cortex decreased roughly exponentially during perinatal and postnatal periods and that it approached the asymptote by postnatal day 70 [Oishi T, Higo N, Umino Y, Matsuda K, Hayashi M (1998) Development of GAP-43 mRNA in the macaque cerebral cortex. Dev Brain Res 109:87-97]. The present findings may indicate that extensive synaptic growth of thalamic neurons continues even after that of cortical neurons has finished. We then performed in situ hybridization to investigate whether the expression level of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was different among various thalamic nuclei. In the infant thalamus (postnatal days 70-90), moderate to intense expression of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was detected in all thalamic nuclei. Quantitative analysis in the infant thalamus indicated that the expression levels were different between the nuclear groups that are defined by the origin of their afferents. The expression in the first order nuclei, which receive their primary afferent fibers from ascending pathways [Guillery RW (1995) Anatomical evidence concerning the role of the thalamus in corticocortical communication: a brief review. J Anat 187 (Pt 3):583-592], was significantly higher than that in the higher order nuclei. While moderate expression was also detected in the adult dorsal thalamus, the expression in the first order nuclei was almost the same as that in the higher order nuclei. Thus, the in situ hybridization experiments indicated that the transient postnatal increase in the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA, which was shown by the Northern blot analysis, was mainly attributed to enhanced expression in the first order nuclei during the postnatal period. This may be a molecular basis for environmentally induced modification of thalamocortical synapses.

An important contributor to normal sleep patterns is a low-threshold calcium current mediated by T-type calcium channels. The T-type calcium current underlies burst responses in thalamic nuclei that are important to spindle propagation, and we recently observed that this current is sensitive to acute low doses of ethanol. Methods: We used a combination of current clamp and voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys that have chronically self-administered ethanol to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure may affect T-type currents. Results: Current clamp recordings from the LGN of ethanol naive macaques showed characteristic burst responses. However, recordings from the LGN in macaques that self-administered ethanol revealed a significant attenuation of bursts across a range of voltages (n = 5). Voltage clamp recordings from control LGN neurons (n = 16) and neurons (n = 29) from brain slices from chronically drinking macaques showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in T-type current kinetics or in the membrane resistance of the thalamic cells between the two cohorts. However, mean T-type current amplitude measured in the chronically drinking animals was reduced by 31% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure.

The preferred stimulus orientation of these columns span the full range of orientations, as observed in recordings of spikes and in classical optical imaging of intrinsic signals. However, when we imaged the putative thalamic input to striate cortical cells that can be seen in imaging of intrinsic signals when they are analyzed on a larger spatial scale, we found that the orientation domain map of the primary visual cortex did not show the same diversity of orientations. This map was dominated by just the one orientation that is most commonly preferred by neurons in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus. This supports cortical feature selectivity and columnar architecture being built upon feed-forward signals transmitted from the thalamus in a very limited number of broadly tuned input channels.;"[Mohan, Yamni S.; Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Lloyd, Errol K.

Axons were labeled from the thalamus by a fluorescent carbocyanine dye in fixed tissue or by transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin from the eye. Thalamic axons first reached the cortex 2 weeks after birth and grew into the developing cortical plate without a waiting period in the subplate. The first thalamocortical synapses were detected 2 weeks later solely throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate, where layer 6 cells previously have been shown to reside. As the thickness of the cortex increased with age, thalamocortical synapses were increasingly prevalent in the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. With the appearance of layer 4, thalamocortical synapses were found there as well as in the marginal zone and layer 6. There was no evidence for an early population of thalamocortical synapses in the subplate.

However, it is unknown whether these increases occur in the thalamic division of the auditory system, the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Furthermore, it is also unclear whether these age-related changes are specific to the macaque auditory system or are generalized to other sensory systems. To address these questions, the PV immunoreactivity of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) from seven rhesus macaques ranging in age from 15 to 35 was assessed. Densities of PV expressing neurons in the three subdivisions of the MGN and the six layers of the LGN were calculated separately using unbiased stereological sampling techniques. We found that the ventral and magnocellular subdivisions of the MGN and all six layers of the LGN increased their expressions of PV with age, although increases in the MGN were greater in magnitude than in the LGN. Together, these results suggest that the MGN shows age-related increases in PV expression as is seen throughout the macaque ascending auditory system, and that the analogous region of the visual system shows smaller increases. We conclude that, while there are some similarities between sensory systems, the age-related neurochemical changes seen throughout the macaque auditory system cannot be fully generalized to other sensory systems.;"[Gray, Daniel T.; Rudolph, Megan L.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Davis";Recanzone, GH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ghrecanzone@ucdavis.edu;;;"NIA [R21AG024372, R01AG034137]; NIDCD [T32DC008072]";"NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))";The authors would like to thank Xochi Navarro and Dina Juarez Salinas for their help with this project, and Rhonda Oates-O'Brien and Guy Martin for excellent animal care.

Methods: High-resolution MR images were acquired in patients with schizophrenia (n=106) and normal comparison subjects (n=42). Patients were divided into good-outcome (n=52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian, n=54) subtypes based on their ability for self-care. Correlations between the relative gray and white matter volumes of the individual cortical Brodmann's areas and five dorsoventral levels of the thalamus were assessed. Results: Compared to normal subjects, schizophrenia patients lacked significant thalamic gray matter volume correlations with the prefrontal and medial temporal cortical regions in the right hemisphere, and with frontal, cingulate, posterior parietal and occipital regions in the left hemisphere, while normal white matter volume cortical-thalamic correlations along the cingulate gyrus and in the temporal lobe were not found in schizophrenia patients in both hemispheres. In contrast to both normal comparison subjects and good-outcome group, schizophrenia patients with poor outcomes showed significant bilateral gray matter volume correlations between the dorsal thalamus and ventral prefrontal cortex, while the group differences in the white matter volume correlations were mostly restricted to the cingulate arch. Conclusions: Whereas patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficiencies in cortical-thalamic correlational patterns, poor outcome is associated with abnormal interregional correlations not observed in either normal subjects or patients with good outcomes. This latter finding may be explained by a core neurodevelopmental disturbance that results in aberrant cortical-thalamic connectivity in poor-outcome schizophrenia. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In rats and mice RE is distinguished by bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a role in memory and cognition. In primates, many foundational questions pertaining to RE remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by investigating the composition of the rhesus monkey RE in both sexes by labeling for GABA, a marker of inhibitory neurons, and for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR), which label thalamic excitatory neurons that project to cortex. As in rats and mice, the macaque RE was mostly populated by CB and CR neurons, characteristic of matrix-dominant nuclei, and had bidirectional connections with hippocampus and mPFC area 25 (A25). Unlike rodents, we found GABAergic neurons in the monkey RE and a sparser but consistent population of core-associated thalamocortical PV neurons. RE had stronger connections with the basal amygdalar complex than in rats or mice. Amygdalar terminations were enriched with mitochondria and frequently formed successive synapses with the same postsynaptic structures, suggesting an active and robust pathway to RE. Significantly, hippocampal pathways formed multisynaptic complexes that uniquely involved excitatory projection neurons and dendrites of local inhibitory neurons in RE, extending this synaptic principle beyond sensory to high-order thalamic nuclei. Convergent pathways from hippocampus, A25, and amygdala in RE position it to flexibly coordinate activity for memory, cognition, and emotional context, which are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases in humans.;"[Joyce, Mary Kate P.; Marshall, Laura G.; Banik, Shimrani L.; Wang, Jingyi; Xiao, Danqing; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Marshall, Laura G.; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wang, Jingyi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Xiao, Danqing] Regis Coll, STEM Dept, Weston, MA 02493 USA; [Bunce, Jamie G.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Joyce, Mary Kate P.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Regis University; Northeastern University; Yale University";"Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.";barbas@bu.edu;"wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022";"Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Marshall, Laura Garcia/0000-0001-7100-6846; Wang, Jingyi/0000-0002-7903-0952";National Institutes of Health [R01MH057414, R01MH117785];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01MH057414 and R01MH117785.

This is the first investigation that explores the problem by direct comparison, in the same animal, of thalamic zones that 1) project to M1 and SMA and 2) receive cerebellar-nuclear (CN) and pallidal (GP) afferents. These four zones were mapped in two monkeys by means of two retrograde tracers for M1 and SMA injections and of two anterograde tracers for CN and GP injections. All injections were performed under electrophysiological control (microstimulation and multiunit recordings). Injections in cortical areas were restricted to the hand/arm representation; in the SMA, the tracer deposit was within the ''SMA-proper'' (or ''area F3'') and did not include its rostral extension (''pre-SMA'' or ''area F6''). It was found that zones of all four types formed a number of highly complex patches of labeling that were usually not confined to one cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus. The overlap of clusters of labeled terminals and perikarya was evaluated morphometrically (area measurements) on a number of coronal sections along the anteroposterior extent of the motor thalamus. In line with previous studies, the thalamic territories innervated by CN and GP afferents rarely overlapped. However, zones projecting to M1 and/or to SMA included thalamic regions receiving CN as well as GP projections, providing the first evidence of such overlap from individual animals. The present observations support the previous conclusion from this laboratory (based on transsynaptic labeling) that the SMA receives, apart from its strong pallidal transthalamic input, a CN transthalamic input. These present findings that both M1 and SMA are recipients of transthalamic inputs from GP and CN thus support the concept that a mixed subcortical input consisting of weighted contributions from cerebellum, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and spinothalamic tract is directed to each functional component of the sensorimotor cortex.

Whether similar dynamics apply to the thalamus and in particular to the pulvinar is largely unknown. Here, we examined electrophysiological recordings from two adult rhesus macaques performing a perceptual task and comparatively investigated trial-to-trial variability in higher-order thalamus (ventral and dorsal pulvinar), the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex (area V4) prior to and following the presentation of a visual stimulus. We found spiking variability during stable fixation prior to stimulus onset to be considerably lower in both pulvinar and the LGN as compared to area V4. In contrast to the prominent variability reduction in V4 upon stimulus onset, variability in the thalamic nuclei was largely unaffected by visual stimulation. There was a small but significant variability decrease in the dorsal pulvinar, but not in the ventral portion of the pulvinar, which is closely connected to visual cortices and would thus have been expected to reflect cortical response properties. This dissociation did not stem from differences in response strength or mean firing rates and indicates fundamental differences in variability quenching between thalamus and cortex.;"[Poland, E.; Wilke, M.] UMG, Dept Cognit Neurol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Donner, T.

The presence of four inferior subdivisions, comparable to those found in architectonic-connectional studies in squirrel monkeys (C.G. Cusick, J.L. Scripter, J.G. Darensbourg, and J.T. Weber, 1993, J. Comp. Neurol. 336:1-30), provided a basis for a proposed revised terminology for visual sectors of the macaque pulvinar. In the present study, the inferior pulvinar (PI) was identified as a neurochemically distinct region that included the traditional cytoarchitectonic nucleus PI and adjacent portions of the lateral and medial pulvinar nuclei, PL and PM. In calbindin-D-28k stains, the lateral subdivision of the inferior pulvinar (PIL) had less intense neuropil staining than the adjacent central division, PIC. The PIL was characterized by large, intensely immunopositive neurons seldom found within PIC. PIL occupied the traditional PL and PI and exhibited a narrow shell zone, PIL-S, restricted to FL. The medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PIM) was in a location previously shown to be strongly connected with the middle temporal visual area (MT) in macaques. PIM was found in the medial one-half of the traditional PI and extended into adjacent portions of the traditional PM and FL. PIM was distinguished by less intense neuropil staining for calbindin and many cells stained with the SMI-32 antibody for neurofilament protein. In AChE stains, PIL was moderately dark, PIC appeared lighter, and PIM was characterized by small, intensely stained patches. The small posterior division (PIp) stained darkly for calbindin, lightly for AChE, and was unstained with the SMI-32 antibody. Thus, neurochemical, and perhaps connectional, subdivisions exist within PI, the region of the pulvinar that relays information to striate, ''lower order'' extrastriate, and inferotemporal visual cortex.

Transneuronal atrophy occurred in neurons of the dorsal column (DCN) and ventral posterior lateral thalamic (VPL) nuclei in monkeys subjected to cervical and upper thoracic dorsal rhizotomies for 13-21 years and that had shown extensive representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex and thalamus in other experiments. Volumes of DCN and VPL, number and sizes of neurons, and neuronal packing density were measured by unbiased stereological techniques. When compared with the opposite, unaffected, side, the ipsilateral cuneate nucleus (CN), external cuneate nucleus (ECN), and contralateral VPL showed reductions in volume: 44-51% in CN, 37-48% in ECN, and 32-38% in VPL. In the affected nuclei, neurons were progressively shrunken with increasing survival time, and their packing density increased, but there was relatively little loss of neurons (10-16%). There was evidence for loss of axons of atrophic CN cells in the medial lemniscus and in the thalamus, with accompanying severe disorganization of the parts of the ventral posterior nuclei representing the normally innervated face and the deafferented upper limb. Secondary transneuronal atrophy in VPL, associated with retraction of axons of CN neurons undergoing primary transneuronal atrophy, is likely to be associated with similar withdrawal of axons from the cerebral cortex and should be a powerful influence on reorganization of somatotopic maps in the somatosensory cortex.;"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Tulane Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Struct & Cellular Biol, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Psychol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; Tulane University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;"NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA095616] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH53369] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS21377, NS35246, R01 NS021377] Funding Source: Medline";"NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;83;49;49;0;1;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Spike activity of 67 neurons (48 simple, 19 complex cells) was extracellulary recorded from area 17/18 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. A total of 107 subfields (on/off) were mapped by applying, a reverse correlation technique to the activity elicited by bright and dark rectangles flashed for 300 ms in a 20 x 10 grid. We found that the width of the (suprathreshold) discharge fields shrank on average by 22% during this 300-ms-long stimulus presentation time. Fifty-eight subfields (54%) shrank by more than 20% of peak width and only ten (less than 10%) showed a slight increase over time. The main size reduction took place 40-60 ms after response onset, which corresponded to the transition from transient peak firing to tonic visual activity in thalamocortical relay cells (TC). The experimentally obtained RFs were then fitted with the aid of a neural field model of the primary visual pathway. Assuming a Gaussian-shaped spatial sensitivity profile across the RF subfield width, the model allowed us to estimate the subthreshold RF (depolarization field, D-field) from the minimal discharge field (MDF). The model allowed us to test to what degree the temporal dynamics of thalamocortical activity contributes to the spatiotemporal changes of cortical RFs. To this end, we performed the fitting procedure either with a pure feedforward model or with a field model that also included intracortical feedback. Spatial and temporal parameters obtained from fits of the experimental RFs matched closely to those achieved by simulating a pure feedforward system with the field model but were not compatible with additional intracortical feedback. Thus, our results show that dot stimulation, which optimally excites thalamocortical cells, leads to a shrinkage with respect to the size of the RF subfield at the first transient response of visual cortical RFs which seems mainly due to a change in the thalamic firing pattern. In these experiments little or no influence from intracortical sources was observed, which, however, may play a role when using more complex visual stimuli.;"Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Physiol, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Stirling, Dept Psychol, Stirling FK8 4LA, Scotland";"Ruhr University Bochum; Max Planck Society; University of Stirling";Funke, K (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Physiol, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.;;;Funke, Klaus/0000-0003-2359-8917;;;;;54;25;25;0;3;SPRINGER-VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

The model consisted of 65 000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex.

Cortical areas of the supratemporal plane were delineated in Macaca fuscata (M. fuscata) by immunocytochemical staining for parvalbumin, staining for cytochrome oxidase, examination of cyto- and myeloarchitecture, and retrograde tracing of corticocortical connections. Comparative observations were made on Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis). Differential staining of fiber plexuses, probably of thalamic origin, identifies a central core zone of dense immunostaining and a surrounding zone of moderate-to-dense immunostaining composed of anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields. Outside the second zone, there is a third anterolateral zone of weaker immunoreactivity, and, outside that zone, there is a fourth zone in which immunoreactivity is virtually absent. Differences in parvalbumin immunostaining in the auditory fields may reflect differences in relative contributions of thalamic inputs from parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells in the medial geniculate complex. The central core zone and the surrounding three fields can be correlated with major auditory fields previously defined by multiunit mapping and thalamocortical connectivity. The core zone contains a large principal field and an anterior extension, The pattern of corticocortical connections between these and adjoining fields suggests that the anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields represent first steps in three streams of connections passing outward from auditory into association cortex. M. fuscata has an unusually large auditory cortex that is more deeply placed in the lateral sulcus in comparison to that of M. fascicularis. A small annectant gyrus provides a guide to the position of the primary auditory area.

A model of unilateral peripheral neuropathy was developed in the cynomolgus macaque, a species that is phylogenetically close to humans. Nerve entrapment was induced by placing a 4 mm length of polyvinyl cuff around the left common sciatic nerve. Prior to nerve injury, stimulation of the foot with a range of non-noxious von Frey filaments (1, 4, 8, 15, and 26 g) did not evoke brain activation as observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two weeks after injury, stimulation of the ipsilateral foot with non-noxious filaments activated the contralateral insula/secondary somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). By contrast, no activation was observed with stimulation of the contralateral foot. Robust bilateral activation of thalamus was observed three to five weeks after nerve injury. Treatment with the clinical analgesic pregabalin reduced evoked activation of Ins/SII, thalamus and ACC whereas treatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant reduced activation of the ipsilateral (left) thalamus. Twelve to 13 weeks after nerve injury, treatment with pregabalin reduced evoked activation of all regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, brain activation persisted in most ROI, except the ACC, following aprepitant treatment. Activation of the contralateral Ins/SII and bilateral thalamus was observed six months after nerve injury and pregabalin treatment suppressed activation of these nuclei. The current findings demonstrated persistent changes in CNS neurons following nerve injury as suggested by activation with non-painful mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, it was possible to functionally distinguish between a clinically efficacious analgesic drug, pregabalin, from a drug that has not demonstrated significant clinical analgesic efficacy, aprepitant. In vivo neuroimaging in the current nonhuman model could enhance translatability.;"[Hama, Aldric; Yano, Mizuho; Sotogawa, Wakana; Fujii, Rintaro; Awaga, Yuji; Natsume, Takahiro; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki] Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Hayashi, Ikuo] Hamamatsu Pharma Res USA Inc, San Diego, CA USA";;Hama, A (corresponding author), Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Kita Ku, 1-3-7 Shinmiyakoda, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4312103, Japan.;aldric-hama@hpharma.jp;;;;;;;69;1;1;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;;1744-8069;;MOL PAIN;Mol.

Secondary pathways involving superior colliculus, koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar and their V1-bypassing projections to higher order cortex are known to exist. While they may form an evolutionary old visual system, their contribution to perception and visually guided behaviour remain largely obscure. Recent developments in tract tracing and circuit manipulation technologies provide new insights. Here we discuss how secondary visual pathways mediate residual vision (blindsight) after V1 injury by relaying signals directly into higher order cortical areas. We contrast these findings on blindsight with new studies on dyslexia suggesting that dysfunction of secondary visual pathways might contribute to dyslexic's perceptual difficulties. Emerging from these considerations, secondary visual pathways involving koniocellular LGN may be critical for detection of visual change, whereas pulvinar function appears more linked to visuomotor planning.;"[Rima, Samy] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Schmid, Michael Christoph] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England";"University of Fribourg; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";"Rima, S (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.";"samy.rima@unifr.ch; michael.schmid@unifr.ch";"RIMA, Samy/HZJ-2821-2023; Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020";"RIMA, Samy/0000-0003-3598-3505; Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X";"ERC [637638]; European Research Council (ERC) [637638] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)";"ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)";This work was supported by ERC starting grant 637638 OptoVision.;;67;6;6;0;3;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;;2468-8673;;CURR OPIN PHYSIOL;Curr.

The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating feedforward loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([H-3]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA-VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA-VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits.;Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA;University of Rochester;Haber, SN (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;suzanne_haber@urmc.rochester.edu;McFarland, Nikolaus R/I-4209-2017;McFarland, Nikolaus R/0000-0002-8699-8857;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH11661, F31 MH011661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS022511, NS22511] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;64;334;342;0;12;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We found that neurons in the dorsal and ventral pulvinar, but not the LGN, showed changes in spiking rate according to stimulus visibility. Passive viewing control sessions showed such modulation to be independent of the monkeys' active report. Perceptual suppression was also accompanied by a marked drop in low-frequency power (9-30 Hz) of the local field potential (LFP) throughout the visual thalamus, but this modulation was not observed during passive viewing.

In the present study and its companion (Smiley et al., J. Comp. Neurol.

Other than CM, target areas included: A1, caudolateral belt (CL), retroinsular (Ri), and temporal parietotemporal (Tpt). Cells labeled by injections of these areas were distributed mainly among the ventral (MGV), posterodorsal (MGpd), anterodorsal (MGad), and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC) and several nuclei with established multisensory features: posterior (Po), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM). The principal inputs of CM were MGad, MGv, and MGm, with secondary inputs from multisensory nuclei. The main inputs of CL were Po and MGpd, with secondary inputs from MGad, MGm, and multisensory nuclei. A1 was dominated by inputs from MGv and MGad, with light multisensory inputs. The input profile of Tpt closely resembled that of CL, but with reduced MGC inputs. Injections of Ri also involved CM but strongly favored MGm and multisensory nuclei, with secondary inputs from MGC and the inferior division (VPI) of the ventroposterior complex (VP).

Here, we analysed noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin in motor (ventrolateral and ventroanterior) and non-motor (mediodorsal, centromedian, ventroposterior lateral and reticular) thalamic nuclei in MPTP-treated monkeys who were always asymptomatic; who recovered from mild parkinsonism; and monkeys with stable, either moderate or severe parkinsonism. We found that only the symptomatic parkinsonian animals had significant noradrenaline losses specifically in the motor thalamus, with the ventroanterior motor nucleus being affected only in the severe parkinsonian animals. In contrast, the striatal dopamine loss was identical in both the mild and severe symptom groups. MPTP-treatment had no significant effect on noradrenaline in non-motor thalamic nuclei or dopamine and serotonin in any thalamic subregion. We conclude that in the MPTP primate model, loss of noradrenaline in the motor thalamus may also contribute to the clinical expression of the parkinsonian motor disorder, corroborating experimentally our hypothesis on the role of thalamic noradrenaline deficit in Parkinson's disease.";"[Pifl, Christian; Hornykiewicz, Oleh] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Univ Navarra Clin, CIMA, Neurosci Div, Movement Disorders Grp, Pamplona, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Univ Navarra Clin, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Pamplona, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Inst Salud Carlos III, Minist Ciencia & Innovac, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat, Madrid, Spain; [Cavada, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, Madrid, Spain; [Cavada, Carmen] Inst Invest Sanitaria IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain";"Medical University of Vienna; University of Navarra; University of Navarra; CIBERNED; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Autonomous University of Madrid";Pifl, C (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, Spitalgasse 4, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;christian.pifl@meduniwien.ac.at;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020; Blesa, Javier/M-3473-2014; Blesa, Javier/GLQ-5299-2022";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Pifl, Christian/0000-0003-1456-4264";"Plan Nacional de Investigacion [SAF2005-08416, SAF2008-04276]; UTE-CIMA; University of Navarra";"Plan Nacional de Investigacion; UTE-CIMA; University of Navarra";"We thank Ing.

The thalamus also receives inputs from basal ganglia nuclei (BG) involved in value-based decision making, suggesting a role in the value process. We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning. Our data indicate that single neurons in the posterior thalamus not only processed simple visual information but also represented historical values. Furthermore, our data suggest an SC-posterior thalamus-BG-SC subcortical loop circuit that encodes the historical value, enabling a quick automatic gaze by bypassing the visual cortex.;"[Kim, Hyoung F.] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Griggs, Whitney S.; Hikosaka, Okihide] NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Seoul National University (SNU); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Kim, HF (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;hfkim@snu.ac.kr;;Griggs, Whitney/0000-0003-2941-6803;"Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health; National Eye Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1A2C2005213]";"Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)";We thank M.K.

Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus.

SUMMARY ANSWER Behavioral, pharmacological and in vivo brain imaging findings indicate that pain can be quantified in macaques with endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is characterized by abdominopelvic hypersensitity. The mechanism by which endometriosis evokes pain is largely unknown, as currently available analgesics offer limited pain relief. Thus, there is a need for both greater understanding of the in vivo mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain and better methods of testing novel therapeutics. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Pain-related behavior and brain activation were assessed in five cynomolgus macaques with endometriosis. Three healthy female macaques served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Abdominopelvic sensitivity to force was assessed with an algometer. Activation of brain areas using block design force stimulation and the effects of a single dose of the analgesic drug morphine and 2-month treatment with the progestin dienogest on brain activation were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Pain response thresholds in macaques with endometriosis were significantly less than that of healthy macaques (P = 0.0003). In addition, non-noxious force activated the insula and thalamus, which was reduced with morphine and 2-month dienogest treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The specific role of cysts, such as peritoneal cysts, in endometriosis pain was not explored. While non-noxious stimulation activated the insula and thalamus, macaques were sedated during fMRI scans. Current findings need further confirmation in a larger cohort. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current study demonstrated central sensitization and related pain behavior in macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis. Altered functioning of the central nervous system could be the focus of future mechanistic studies and for the development of novel therapeutics.

A previous study showed that neuron number in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is reduced following early gestational exposure to x-irradiation (Algan and Rakic [1997] J. Comp. Neurol. 12: 335-352). Here we examine whether similarly timed irradiation decreases neuron number in three associational thalamic nuclei: mediodorsal (MD), anterior, and pulvinar. Ten macaques were exposed to multiple doses of x-rays (total exposure (175-350 cGy) in early gestation (E33-E42) or midgestation (E70-E90); eight nonirradiated macaques were controls. Only the early-irradiated monkeys, not the midgestationally irradiated animals, exhibited deficits in whole-thalamic neuron (-15%) and glia numbers (-21%) compared with controls. Reduction of neuron number (-26%) and volume (-29%) was particularly pronounced in MD. In contrast, cell number and volume were not significantly decreased in the anterior or pulvinar nuclei following early gestational irradiation. Thus, reduced thalamic neuron number was associated specifically with irradiation in early gestation. Persistence of the thalamic neuronal deficit in adult animals indicates that prenatally deleted neurons had not been replenished during maturation or in adulthood. The selective reduction of MD neuron number also supports the protomap hypothesis that neurons of each thalamic nucleus originate sequentially from separate lines of neuronal stem cells (Rakic [1977a] J. Comp. Neurol. 176:23-52). The early gestationally irradiated macaque is discussed as a potentially useful model for studying the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia. J. Comp.

However, their functional relationship remains to be elucidated. Here, we employ resting-state functional MRI to investigate the temporal correlations of spontaneous fluctuations between the thalamus [the whole thalamus and its three largest nuclei (bilateral mediodorsal, ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei)] and visual cortex under both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The whole thalamus show negative correlations with the visual cortex and positive correlations with its contralateral counterpart in eyes closed condition, but which are significantly decreased in eyes open condition, consistent with previous findings of electroencephalography desynchronization during eyes open resting state. Furthermore, we find that bilateral thalamic mediodorsal nuclei and bilateral ventrolateral nuclei have remarkably similar connectivity maps, and resemble to those of the whole thalamus, suggesting their crucial contributions to the thalamus-visual correlations. The bilateral pulvinar nuclei are found to show distinct functional connectivity patterns, compatible with previous findings of the asymmetry of anatomical and functional organization in the nuclei. Our data provides evidence for the associations of intrinsic spontaneous neuronal activity between the thalamus and visual cortex under different resting conditions, which might have implications on the understanding of the generation and modulation of the alpha rhythm.

The rostral RNT showed specific topographical organization of its cerebellar connections. Microinjections into the rostral RNT, 1.6 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the anterior interposed (emboliform nucleus) and scarce HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei, whereas injections into the rostral RNT, 1.8 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the posterior interposed (globose nucleus) and scarce lightly HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar connections with the rostral RNT were exclusively ipsilateral to the injection site. No HRP-labelled cells were detected in the medial (fastigial nucleus) cerebellar nucleus. The cerebellar connections reach the RNT via the superior cerebellar peduncle. By contrast, HRP injections into the anterior, posterior interposed and lateral cerebellar nuclei produced no labelled cells within the RNT. This study demonstrates the existence of direct cerebello-RNT but not RNT-cerebellar connections.

Dense global subnetworks of these pathways have often been studied, primarily due to their functional implications. Instead we study sparse local subnetworks of the pathways to establish the role of a brain area in enabling shortest path communication between its non-adjacent topological neighbours. We propose a novel metric to measure the topological communication load on a vertex due to its immediate neighbourhood, and show that in terms of distribution of this local communication load, a network of Macaque long distance pathways is substantially different from other real world networks and random graph models. Macaque network contains the entire range of local subnetworks, from star-like networks to clique-like networks, while other networks tend to contain a relatively small range of subnetworks. Further, sparse local subnetworks in the Macaque network are not only found across topographical super-areas, e.g., lobes, but also within a super-area, arguing that there is conservation of even relatively short-distance pathways. To establish the communication role of a vertex we borrow the concept of brokerage from social science, and present the different types of brokerage roles that brain areas play, highlighting that not only the thalamus, but also cingulate gyrus and insula often act as relays for areas in the neocortex.

In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque. These SPP1 mRNA-positive neurons were most abundant in the primary motor area, followed by Brodmann area 5 and the supplementary motor area, in accordance with the distribution of corticospinal neurons. In addition, injection of a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer into the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) of the spinal cord caused labeling of SPP1 positive neurons, indicating the expression of SPP1 in corticospinal neurons. SPP1 was also expressed in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal ventral horn of the rhesus macaque. Although SPP1 was also detected in the brainstem and spinal cord of the marmoset and the rat, it was not detected in their cerebral cortices. Selective expression in the corticospinal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque suggests that SPP1 plays a critical role in the functional or structural specialization of highly developed corticospinal systems in certain primate species.

The striatum is a target also of crossed corticostriatal (CSt) projections from the contralateral hemisphere, which have been so far somewhat neglected. In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones. The present study is the first detailed description of this anatomic pathway of the macaque brain and provides the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and selection of actions or action sequences, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.;"[Borra, Elena; Biancheri, Dalila; Rizzo, Marianna; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Med & Chirurg, Unita Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Leonardi, Fabio] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Med Vet, I-43100 Parma, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Parma";Borra, E (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Med & Chirurg, Unita Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;elena.borra@unipr.it;;Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618;"University of Parma; Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) [2017: 2017KZNZLN_002]";"University of Parma; Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN)";This work was supported by the University of Parma and cosponsored by Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante (G.L.), Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) 2017: 2017KZNZLN_002 (E.B.).

Mutations in MCT8 or OATP1C1 result in severe disorders with dramatic movement disability related to alterations in basal ganglia motor circuits. Mapping the expression of MCT8/OATP1C1 in those circuits is necessary to explain their involvement in motor control. We studied the distribution of both transporters in the neuronal subpopulations that configure the direct and indirect basal ganglia motor circuits using immunohistochemistry and double/multiple labeling immunofluorescence for TH transporters and neuronal biomarkers. We found their expression in the medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum (the receptor neurons of the corticostriatal pathway) and in various types of its local microcircuitry interneurons, including the cholinergic. We also demonstrate the presence of both transporters in projection neurons of intrinsic and output nuclei of the basal ganglia, motor thalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, suggesting an important role of MCT8/OATP1C1 for modulating the motor system. Our findings suggest that a lack of function of these transporters in the basal ganglia circuits would significantly impact motor system modulation, leading to clinically severe movement impairment.;"[Wang, Ting; Wang, Yu; Prensa, Lucia; Rausell, Estrella] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Wang, Ting; Wang, Yu] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Cajal Inst, PhD Program Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Montero-Pedrazuela, Ana; Guadano-Ferraz, Ana] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Consejo Super Invest Cient CSIC, Inst Invest Biomed Alberto Sols, Madrid 28029, Spain";"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Cajal (IC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (IIBM)";"Rausell, E (corresponding author), Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Guadano-Ferraz, A (corresponding author), Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Consejo Super Invest Cient CSIC, Inst Invest Biomed Alberto Sols, Madrid 28029, Spain.";"ting.wang02@estudiante.uam.es; yu.wang01@estudiante.uam.es; amontero@iib.uam.es; lucia.prensa@uam.es; ana.guadano.ferraz@csic.es; estrella.rausell@uam.es";Guadano-Ferraz, Ana/J-7870-2013;Guadano-Ferraz, Ana/0000-0002-0666-935X;"MCIN/AEI [SAF2017-86342-R, PID2020-113139RB-I00]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [2020AEP044]; Sherman Foundation [OTR02211]; Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo [OTR06190]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)";"MCIN/AEI; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas(Spanish Government); Sherman Foundation; Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council)";"This research was funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (Grant No. SAF2017-86342-R to A.G.-F.); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/FEDER Una manera de hacer Europa (Grant No. PID2020-113139RB-I00 to A.G.-F.); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (Grant No. 2020AEP044 to A.G.-F.); the Sherman Foundation (Grant No. OTR02211 to A.G.-F.); Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo (Grant No. OTR06190 to A.G.-F.), Y.W. is a beneficiary of a fellowship from China Scholarship Council (CSC).";;95;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1661-6596;1422-0067;;INT J MOL SCI;Int.

In two awake, juvenile male Macaca fascicularis monkeys, microstimulation was applied in ventralis anterior (VA), ventralis lateralis (VL), or ventralis posterior lateralis (VPL) of the thalamus. Thalamic recording was used to identify the region that contained pallidal-receiving (PR) thalamic neurons, cells that responded orthodromically to stimulation in the internal pallidal segment (GPi). Thalamic stimulation was used to elicit motor responses. Penetrations in the thalamus and the pallidum focused on areas with activity related to contralateral arm movement. Fifty one PR cells were identified electrophysiologically in VL oralis (VLo), VL caudalis (VLc) and VA pars parvocellularis (VApc). 2. With a subject at rest, trains of stimuli were applied through the thalamic microelectrode. Palpable or visible muscle twitches or joint movements were evoked by short trains (12 pulses) of stimuli applied in VLc and VPL oralis (VPLo); thresholds there ranged from 5 to 75 mu A. In VA and VLo, areas where PR neurons were located, even longer trains (24 pulses) of stimuli with currents up to 200 mu A usually failed to evoke movement. In the caudal portions of VLo, near VPLo, there were some microexcitable sites found near PR cells where stimuli at similar to 50 mu A elicited movement. 3. From microstimulation studies combined with histological reconstruction, Ashe and co-workers hypothesized that microexcitable zones were cerebellar receiving areas (CR) and nonexcitable zones were PR areas. Our data support theirs and add electrophysiological identification of PR areas. Further, we injected wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the thalamus at one of the more rostral microexcitable sites, just caudal and lateral to identified PR cells. The tetra-methyl benzidine-reacted HRP label was found in the contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but not in ipsilateral GPi, showing that even this rostral microexcitable zone was a CR area. 4. Together with evidence from the literature, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that PR cells have relatively weak access to spinal-destined motor outputs, whereas thalamocortical neurons from VPLo and VLc have more secure access. In addition to characteristics of cell discharge and responses to somatosensory stimulation, microexcitability may be a further aid in tentative electrophysiological identification of PR versus CR areas of the motor thalamus without necessarily recording thalamic neuronal responses to stimulation in GPi or the DCN.";"UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT PHYSIOL & BIOPHYS, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT REHABIL MED, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV WASHINGTON, REG PRIMATE RES CTR, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";;;Buford, John A/B-4413-2011;Buford, John A/0000-0001-6464-2617;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00166] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-07097, NS-15017] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;72;28;30;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Limits in the extent of change have been attributed to limited divergence in the thalamocortical projection. However, studies have commonly been restricted to animals surviving less than a year following relatively modest peripheral sensory perturbations. After extensive deafferentation and longterm survival, more extensive changes, seemingly beyond the limits of thalamocortical divergence, have been reported. We report changes in the somatotopic map in area 3b of an adult macaque monkey, in which part of the index finger of one hand had been amputated two years previously. The representation of the remaining stump occupied the whole region of area 3b normally devoted to the representation of the entire digit. The skin surrounding the stump appeared to have been hyperinnervated by axons severed during the amputation. The hyperinnervation of remaining skin may have reactivated neurons of the somatosensory system silenced by the amputation, leading to the recovery of a cortical map but with a modified organization.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;;;;;;;19;44;44;0;2;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8452;;;P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI;Proc.

To this end, we derive a unique network incorporating 410 anatomical tracing studies of the macaque brain from the Collation of Connectivity data on the Macaque brain (CoCoMac) neuroinformatic database. Our network consists of 383 hierarchically organized regions spanning cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia; models the presence of 6,602 directed long-distance connections; is three times larger than any previously derived brain network; and contains subnetworks corresponding to classic corticocortical, corticosubcortical, and subcortico-subcortical fiber systems. We found that the empirical degree distribution of the network is consistent with the hypothesis of the maximum entropy exponential distribution and discovered two remarkable bridges between the brain's structure and function via network-theoretical analysis. First, prefrontal cortex contains a disproportionate share of topologically central regions. Second, there exists a tightly integrated core circuit, spanning parts of premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, insula, and visual cortex, that includes much of the task-positive and task-negative networks and might play a special role in higher cognition and consciousness.";"[Modha, Dharmendra S.] IBM Res Almaden, San Jose, CA 95120 USA; [Singh, Raghavendra] IBM Res India, New Delhi 110070, India";"International Business Machines (IBM); International Business Machines (IBM)";Modha, DS (corresponding author), IBM Res Almaden, San Jose, CA 95120 USA.;dmodha@us.ibm.com;;;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Sciences Office [HR0011-09-C-0002];Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Sciences Office(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA));We thank four anonymous reviewers for a number of constructive suggestions that greatly improved and expanded our original submission.

Single or paired injections of anterogradely transported tracers, of varying anteroposterior extent, were made horizontally from behind in defined parts of the body representation in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and/or ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamic nuclei, and the distribution and density of labeled thalamocortical terminations were mapped in cortex. injections of increasing size in any dimension of VPL or VPM resulted in increasing accumulation of labeled terminals within the region of projection, implying extensive convergence of individual axons. Anteroposteriorly elongated injections labeled mediolaterally extended but anteroposteriorly restricted zones in cortex. Dorsoventral placement of an injection in VPL or VPM determined anteroposterior location of labeling in cortex. Dual injections separated mediolaterally or dorsoventrally by similar to 1 mm, and in different parts of the thalamic body or head-face representation gave rise to labeled thalamocortical terminations that overlapped extensively. For injection sites at different anteroposterior levels in VPL or VPM, the area of cortical convergence was related to their extent of anteroposterior coincidence. Labeled terminations arising from injections in immediately adjacent parts of VPL and VPM did not overlap in cortex. The extent of thalamocortical divergence and convergence revealed by these experiments is greater than that predictable from labeling of single axons and is sufficiently great to account for representational plasticity that exceeds the 1.5 mm cortical distance limit..;"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Autonoma Madrid, Sch Med, Dept Morphol, Madrid 28029, Spain";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Autonomous University of Madrid";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 114 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;;Rausell, Estrella/L-8781-2014;Rausell Tamayo, Estrella/0000-0002-1129-7116;"NCI NIH HHS [U01 CA091343] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 21377, R01 NS021377] Funding Source: Medline";"NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;45;58;59;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits.

Less than 25% of the superficial hSI projecting cells were putatively contacted by terminals of cervical enlargement spinothalamic neurons. These cells were primarily located in ventroposterior lateral, ventroposterior inferior and centrolateral nuclei. Although the number of superficial hSI projecting cells numbered less than 20% of the total hSI projecting cells, their patterns of location and their proportion of overlap with STT terminals within each thalamic nucleus were similar.

All areas of the neocortex receive afferent input from and send efferent projections to specific thalamic nuclei. Through these connections, the thalamus serves to provide the cortex with sensory input, and to facilitate interareal cortical communication and motor and cognitive functions. In the visual system, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus is the gateway through which visual information reaches the cerebral cortex. Visual processing in the LGN includes spatial and temporal influences on visual signals that serve to adjust response gain, transform the temporal structure of retinal activity patterns, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the retinal signal while preserving its basic content. This review examines recent advances in our understanding of LGN function and circuit organization and places these findings in a historical context.;"[Usrey, W.

The visual system of macaque has been extensively characterized both anatomically and functionally. We have taken advantage of this to examine the influence of congenital blindness in a macaque model of developmental anophthalmia. Developmental anophthalmia in macaque effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Here we show that retrograde tracers injected in early visual areas, including HC, reveal a drastic reduction of cortical projections of the reduced lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, there is an important expansion of projections from the pulvinar complex to the HC, compared to the controls. These findings show that the functional consequences of congenital blindness need to be considered in terms of both modifications of the interareal cortical network and the ascending visual pathways.;"[Magrou, Loic; Giroud, Pascale; Berland, Michel; Knoblauch, Kenneth; Dehay, Colette; Kennedy, Henry] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst,U1208, F-69500 Bron, France; [Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Barone, Pascal] CNRS, UMR 5549, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31059 Toulouse, France; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Scheeren, Gwylan] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurosci, Swammerdam Inst Life Sci, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Killackey, Herbert P.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Kennedy, Henry] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Amsterdam; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Chinese Academy of Sciences";"Dehay, C; Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst,U1208, F-69500 Bron, France.";"colette.dehay@inserm.fr; henry.kennedy@inserm.fr";"Knoblauch, Kenneth/H-8156-2014; Markov, Nikola T./AFO-2802-2022; Dehay, Colette/H-4437-2014; Kennedy, Henry/B-9636-2013; Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009";"Knoblauch, Kenneth/0000-0002-4681-4638; Markov, Nikola T./0000-0003-1417-1161; Dehay, Colette/0000-0002-5196-1464; Kennedy, Henry/0000-0002-2796-7663; Barone, Pascal/0000-0003-0125-7468";"LABEX CORTEX [ANR-11-LABX-0042]; Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; CORE-NETS [ANR-11-BSV4-501]; ARCHI-CORE [ANR-14-CE13-0033]; CORNET [ANR-15-CE32-0016]; PRIMACOR [ANR-14-CE13-0036]; FRM Equipe [DEQ20160334943]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-CE13-0036, ANR-15-CE32-0016, ANR-14-CE13-0033] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)";"LABEX CORTEX; Universite de Lyon; CORE-NETS; ARCHI-CORE; CORNET; PRIMACOR; FRM Equipe; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";"LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042 to H.K.), Universite de Lyon (ANR-11-IDEX-0007 to H.K.), CORE-NETS (ANR-11-BSV4-501 to H.K.), ARCHI-CORE (ANR-14-CE13-0033 to H.K.), CORNET (ANR15-CE32-0016 to H.K.), PRIMACOR (ANR-14-CE13-0036; all operated by the French National Research Agency [ANR]), and FRM Equipe (DEQ20160334943; operated by the Foundation for Medical Research).";;87;1;1;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

In this short review, I reconsider known anatomic features of corticothalamic connectivity, primarily for macaque monkey, and discuss these as part of an intricate network architecture consistent with multiple connectional recombinations and a diversity of functional tasks. Drawing mainly on results from single axon analysis for the two broad classes of corticothalamic (CT) connections, I review the strikingly complementary spatial parameters of their extrinsic CT arbors in relation to intrinsic cortical collaterals. That is, CT neurons in layer 5 (class II) have spatially compact (low divergent) thalamic fields, but highly spatially divergent cortical collaterals. In contrast, CT neurons in layer 6 (class I) have highly divergent thalamic fields, but delimited, low divergent cortical collaterals. CT convergence in the thalamus is technically more difficult to analyze, but one can infer a low convergence of terminations from layer 5, in contrast with CT terminations from layer 6, which are highly convergent. Reciprocating thalamocortical (TC) axons have multiple clustered and divergent arbors. What to conclude from these relationships requires further investigation of activity patterns and networks under different conditions. Specific parameters are suggestive of selective recruitment of distributed postsynaptic networks and ordered activity sequences; but are these separable systems, operating cooperatively or in parallel (L.5 low divergent/low convergent vs. L. 6 high divergent/high convergent)?";[Rockland, Kathleen S.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St 1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA;Boston University;Rockland, KS (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St 1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;krock@bu.edu;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;57;9;9;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

High concentration of isoflurane resulted in global CBF increase and blood pressure decrease. Evident CBF change was observed in the subcortical structures. Specifically, CBF in thalamus and cerebellum was increased about 39% and 55% when isoflurane concentration was changed from 0.75% to 1.5%, respectively. Also, those regional CBF changes correlated linearly with isoflurane inspiratory concentrations, indicating impaired CBF autoregulation in these structures. In contrast, no obvious CBF changes were observed in anterior cingulated cortex, motor cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and caudate. The results demonstrate that, under the 0.75-1.5% isoflurane maintenance doses, the CBF auto-regulation is well preserved in the cerebral cortical regions and caudate, but impaired in thalamus and cerebellum, indicating disturbed CBF-metabolism coupling and functional response in specific subcortical regions of anesthetized macaque monkeys.

This system is analysed by resorting to informational neuromorphology which deduces particular properties of information processing from spatial features observed on neuronal arborisations or sets of arborisations. The main part of the cerebro-cerebellar circuit is fine grained with relatively small arborisations. Such a fine grain is not used here for the preservation of a simple somatotopic representation, as is the case for sensory systems, but instead for a processing using << patchy maps >> which is a known mode of parallel processing. There is a major break of arborisations geometry which is situated in the cerebellar cortex between the granule and Purkinje cells. The grain cells axons, the parallel fibers, are numerous and almost unbranched while the dendritic arborisations of Purkinje's cells are flat, with a large surface and are perpendicular to the parallel fibers which leads to both a cardinal and a reception convergence. This is also observed in the striato-pallidal system. A significant difference between the two systems which are separated almost everywhere, notably at the thalamic relays level, is that the system passing through the cerebellum essentially processes sensorimotor information while the basal ganglia system receives information from almost the whole cortex. The return to the cortical targets causes complex interferences. It clearly appears that the two motor systems process information in different manners.;;;PERCHERON, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, U106, NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPTL MOUVEMENT LAB, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE.;;"Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018; Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;104;4;4;0;0;MASSON EDITEUR;MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9;21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE;0035-3787;2213-0004;;REV NEUROL-FRANCE;Rev.

Iontophoretic injections guided by physiological recordings were restricted to lamina I or laminae I-II. PHA-L-labeled trigemino- and spinothalamic (TSTT) terminations were identified imimmohistochemically. TRITC- and FITC-labeled dextrans were injected at different levels to confirm topography. Terminations consistently occurred in two main locations: a distinguishable portion of posterolateral thalamus identified cytoarchitectonically as the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) and a portion of posteromedial thalamus designated as the ventral caudal part of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDvc). In addition, isolated fibers bearing boutons of passage were observed in the ventral posterior medial and lateral (VPM and VPL) nuclei, and spinal terminations occurred in the ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI). Isolated terminations occasionally occurred in other sites (e.g., suprageniculate, zona incerta, hypothalamic paraventricular n.). Terminations in MDvc occurred in concise foci that were weakly organized topographically (posteroanterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo consisted of dense clusters of ramified terminal arbors bearing multiple large boutons that were well organized topographically (anteroposterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo colocalized with a field of calbindin-immunoreactive terminal fibers; double-labeled terminals were documented at high magnification. This propitious marker was especially useful at anterior levels, where VMpo can easily be misidentified as VPM. These findings demonstrate phylogenetically novel primate lamina I TSTT projections important for sensory and motivational aspects of pain, temperature, itch, muscle ache, sensual touch, and other interoceptive feelings from the body.

A comprehensive transcriptomic and open chromatin atlas of the rhesus macaque brain is key to a deeper understanding of the brain. Here we characterize the transcriptome of 416 brain samples from 52 regions of 8 rhesus macaque brains. We identify gene modules associated with specific brain regions like the cerebral cortex, pituitary, and thalamus. In addition, we discover 9703 novel intergenic transcripts, including 1701 coding transcripts and 2845 lncRNAs. Most of the novel transcripts are only expressed in specific brain regions or cortical regions of specific individuals. We further survey the open chromatin regions in the hippocampal CA1 and several cerebral cortical regions of the rhesus macaque brain using ATAC-seq, revealing CA1- and cortex-specific open chromatin regions.

Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Kruger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements ( black) better and faster than increments ( white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey's primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).";"[Yeh, Chun-I; Xing, Dajun; Shapley, Robert M.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA";New York University;Yeh, CI (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;ciy@cns.nyu.edu;Xing, Dajun/F-4217-2011;YEH, CHUN-I/0000-0002-2375-0723;"U.

The aim of this study was to establish whether information about force, velocity or duration of movement is encoded in cerebellar thalamic discharge and could therefore be involved in the modulation of motor cortical activity. Extracellular single cell recordings were made from the cerebellar thalamus (66 neurones) and VPLc (49 neurotics) of four conscious macaques performing simple wrist movements with various load and gain conditions imposed. A significant correlation (Spearman's; P < 0.05) was found between movement duration and the duration of neuronal discharge of most cerebellar thalamic neurones (65%), the velocity of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of some cerebellar thalamic neurotics (23%), but not between force of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of any cerebellar thalamic neurones. Similar relationships were found between the activity of VPLc neurones and these movement parameters. The strength of the correlations increased when many cells were grouped and analysed as an ensemble, suggesting that populations of cerebellar thalamic (and VPLc) neurones can encode a signal with higher fidelity than single neurones alone. The ensemble data confirmed that the most robust association was between the duration of neuronal discharge and movement duration. We propose that the cerebellum does not provide the motor cortex with specific information about movement force or velocity, but rather that its major role is in activating many motor cortical regions for a specific duration, thus influencing the timing of complex movements involving many muscles and joints.

Biochemical studies have shown the presence of adrenaline or its biosynthetic enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, in the rat and human thalamus. However, the distribution of the adrenergic fibres in the thalamus has only been demonstrated in rats. We study the adrenergic innervation of the macaque monkey thalamus using immunohistochemistry against phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase. The distribution of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive fibres is markedly heterogeneous and principally restricted to those nuclei, or their portions, that are located in or close to the midline, with the highest density being found in the paraventricular, parafascicular and mediodorsal nuclei. The paraventricular nucleus is densely innervated by adrenergic axons throughout, while the densest innervation of the parafascicular nucleus is located in its medial part and the strongest mediodorsal nuclear immunolabelling is found in its most posterior and medial region. Moderate or low concentrations of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunopositive fibres are present in the paratenial nucleus, and all parts of the central nucleus, nucleus reuniens, central medial nucleus, centromedian nucleus, medial geniculate body and medial pulvinar nucleus, while only scattered immunoreactive axons are found in other thalamic nuclei. The morphology of the phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive axons is quite diverse, as they have different diameters and most are endowed with diversely-shaped varicosities. These findings are the first morphological evidence for the presence of adrenergic innervation in the primate thalamus and reveal that this innervation is highly selective, heterogeneous and more widely distributed in primates than in rats. The thalamic nuclei innervated by adrenaline are connected to widespread limbic and associative cortical areas as well as to subcortical structures, in particular the neostriatum and amygdala. We hypothesize that thalamic adrenaline may be implicated in emotional, social and attentional mechanisms through its facilitation of co-ordinated action by these brain regions. (C) 1998 IBRO.

Despite early evidence and theoretical proposal pointing to an implication of thalamic control in attention, most studies in the past two decades focused on cortical substrates, largely ignoring the contribution of subcortical regions as well as cortico-subcortical interactions. Here, we suggest a key role of the pulvinar in the selection of salient and relevant information via its involvement in priority maps. Prioritization may be achieved through a pulvinar-mediated generation of alpha oscillations, which may then modulate neuronal gain in thalamo-cortical circuits. Such mechanism might orchestrate the synchrony of cortico-cortical interaction, by rendering neural communication more effective, precise and selective. We propose that this theoretical framework will support a timely shift from the prevailing cortico-centric view of cognition to a more integrative perspective of thalamic contributions to attention and executive control processes.;"[Bourgeois, Alexia; Carrera, Emmanuel] Univ Hosp Geneva HUG, Univ Med Sch Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Dept, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Guedj, Carole; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med Sch Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Fundamental Neurosci, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland";"University of Geneva; University of Geneva";"Bourgeois, A (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Geneva HUG, Univ Med Sch Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Dept, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.;Guedj, C (corresponding author), Univ Med Sch Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Fundamental Neurosci, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.";"alexia.bourgeois@unige.ch; carole.guedj@unige.ch";Vuilleumier, Patrik/AAJ-1839-2021;"Vuilleumier, Patrik/0000-0002-8198-9214; Guedj, Carole/0000-0001-9477-8873; Carrera, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0045-5382; Bourgeois, Alexia/0000-0002-7397-6835";"Swiss National Science Foundation [320030_166704, 320030_166535]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [320030_166704, 320030_166535] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)";"Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";This work was supported by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to PV [grant number 320030_166704] and EC [grant number 320030_166535].;;144;14;14;5;15;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0149-7634;1873-7528;;NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R;Neurosci.

To this purpose, restricted injections of neuronal tracers were made into areas F3, F6, F2, and F7 after physiological identification of the injection sites. The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. The main inputs to F3 [supplementary motor area properly defined (SMA-proper)] originate in the nuclei ventral lateral, pars oralis (VLo), ventral posterior lateral, pars oralis (VPLo), and ventral lateral, pars caudalis (VLc) as well as in caudal parts of the VPLo and VLc (VPLo/VLc complex). F6 (pre-SMA) is mainly the target of nucleus ventral anterior, pars parvocellularis (VApc), and area X of Olszewski. The input to F2 originates mainly in the VPLo/VLc complex, in VLc, and in VLo. The dorsal part of F7 (supplementary eye field) mainly receives from area X, VApc, and nucleus ventral anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc), whereas the ventral F7 is connected with VApc, area X, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). It is concluded that each cortical area is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits. F3 and F2 are targets of the so-called ''motor'' basal ganglia circuit and a cerebellar circuit originating in dorsorostral sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. In contrast, F6 and ventral F7 receive a basal ganglia input mainly from the so-called ''complex'' circuit and a cerebellar input originating in the ventrocaudal sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. Finally, with respect to the rest of F7, dorsal F7 also receives a basal ganglia input from the ''oculomotor circuit.''

Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex(1-4). Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus ( TRN). Crick(5) argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that  the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway'', a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.;"[McAlonan, Kerry; Cavanaugh, James; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";McAlonan, K (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;km@nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute;National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the intramural research program of the National Eye Institute.

Thalamic labeling was analyzed following injections of the anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPI) and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the contralateral cerebellar interpositus and dentate nuclei. In addition, the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the physiologically identified hand/arm representation of SMA. The tissue was processed sequentially using different chromogens in order to visualize all three tracers in a single section. We found that the SMA thalamocortical neurons occupied a wide band extending from the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) through the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars medialis (VLm) and into to the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc) including a portion of ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X. The heaviest CTB labeling was found in VLo with dense plexuses of BDA labeled pallidothalamic fibers and swellings often observed superimposed upon retrogradely labeled CTB cells. In addition, dense foci of cerebellothalamic WGA-HRP anterograde label were observed coinciding with the occasional retrogradely CTB labeled neurons in VLc and transitional zones between VApc, VLo and VPLo.

Inflammatory changes in brain could underlie this injury. Here, we evaluated whether neuroinflammation is induced by chorioamnionitis in a clinically relevant model. Methods: Rhesus macaque fetuses were exposed to either intra-amniotic (IA) saline, or IA lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg) 16 or 48 h prior to delivery at 130 days (85 % of gestation) (n = 4-5 animals/group). We measured cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), froze samples from the left brain for molecular analysis, and immersion fixed the right brain hemisphere for immunohistology. We analyzed the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, CCL2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2 in the periventricular white matter (PVWM), cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum by RT-qPCR. Brain injury was assessed by immunohistology for myelin basic protein (MBP), IBA1 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte marker), NeuN (neuronal marker), CD3 (T cells), and CD14 (monocytes). Microglial proliferation was assessed by co-immunostaining for IBA1 and Ki67. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. Results: IA LPS increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PVWM, thalamus, and cerebellum, increased IL-6 concentration in the CSF, and increased apoptosis in the periventricular area after 16 h. Microglial proliferation in the white matter was increased 48 h after IA LPS. Conclusions: LPS-induced chorioamnionitis caused neuroinflammation, microglial proliferation, and periventricular apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of chorioamnionitis in fetal rhesus macaques. These findings identify specific responses in the fetal brain and support the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory changes may mediate the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with chorioamnionitis.;"[Schmidt, Augusto F.; Kannan, Paranthaman S.; Jobe, Alan H.; Kallapur, Suhas G.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neonatol & Pulm Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Chougnet, Claire A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Immunobiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Danzer, Steve C.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesia, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Miller, Lisa A.] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Miller, Lisa A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pediat & Cell Biol & Human Anat, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Kallapur, SG (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neonatol & Pulm Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.;suhas.kallapur@cchmc.org;"Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/H-3992-2018; Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/B-6428-2011; Schmidt, Augusto F/N-4456-2015";"Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/0000-0002-3333-3720; Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/0000-0002-3333-3720; Schmidt, Augusto F/0000-0002-3925-9429";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award; March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund; Preterm Initiative";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award; March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund(Burroughs Wellcome Fund); Preterm Initiative";The funding sources for this study are Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award (A.F.S), March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award (S.G.K), Burroughs-Wellcome Fund, and Preterm Initiative (C.A.C.).;;50;29;30;0;5;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1742-2094;;;J NEUROINFLAMM;J.

We determined regional brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex) immune and virological profiles at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) with SIVmac239 in rhesus macaques. The basal ganglia and thalamus had detectable viruses earlier (7 dpi) than the frontal cortex (14 dpi) and contained higher quantities of viruses than the latter. Increased immune activation of astrocytes and significant infiltration of macrophages in the thalamus at 14 dpi coincided with elevated plasma viral load, and SIV colocalized only within macrophages. RNA signatures of proinflammatory responses, including IL-6, were detected at 7 dpi in microglia and interestingly, preceded reliable detection of virus in tissues and were maintained in the chronically infected macaques. Countering the proinflammatory response, the antiinflammatory response was not detected until increased TGF-beta expression was found in perivascular macrophages at 14 dpi. But this response was not detected in chronic infection. Our data provide evidence that the interplay of acute proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses in the brain likely contributed to the overt neuroinflammation, where the immune activation preceded reliable viral detection.;"[Gopalakrishnan, Raja Mohan; Aid, Malika; Mercado, Noe B.; Davis, Caitlin; Malik, Shaily; Geiger, Emma; Varner, Valerie; Jones, Rhianna; Martinot, Amanda J.; Barouch, Dan H.; Reeves, R.

However, it is unknown whether, and how, these structures are engaged during the observation of actions performed by effectors different from the hand. To address this issue, in the present fMRI study, healthy human participants were required to execute or to observe grasping acts performed with different effectors, namely mouth, hand, and foot. As control, participants executed and observed simple movements performed with the same effectors. The results show that: (1) execution of goal-directed actions elicited somatotopically organized activations not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus; (2) action observation evoked cortical, cerebellar and subcortical activations, lacking a clear somatotopic organization; (3) in the territories displaying shared activations between execution and observation, a rough somatotopy could be revealed in both cortical, cerebellar and subcortical structures. The present study confirms previous findings that action observation, beyond the cerebral cortex, also activates specific sectors of cerebellum and subcortical structures and it shows, for the first time, that these latter are engaged not only during hand actions observation but also during the observation of mouth and foot actions. We suggest that each of the activated structures processes specific aspects of the observed action, such as performing internal simulation (cerebellum) or recruiting/inhibiting the overt execution of the observed action (basal ganglia and sensory-motor thalamus).";"[Errante, Antonino; Gerbella, Marzio; Fogassi, Leonardo] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy; [Errante, Antonino] Univ Hosp Parma, Dept Diagnost, Neuroradiol unit, Via Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Mingolla, Gloria P.] Univ Verona, Dept Neurosci Biomed & Movement Sci, Piazzale Ludov Antonio Scuro 10, I-37124 Verona, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Parma; University Hospital of Parma; University of Verona";Fogassi, L (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy.;"antonino.errante@unipr.it; marzio.gerbella@unipr.it; leonardo.fogassi@unipr.it";;Mingolla, Gloria P./0000-0002-2596-1428;;;;;92;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0896-0267;1573-6792;;BRAIN TOPOGR;Brain Topogr.;JUL;2023;36;4;;;;;476;499;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-023-00960-1;;May 23;24;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;J8XQ3;37133782;hybrid, Green Accepted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000979814900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Movement was triggered by a visual, auditory, or somatosensory stimulus. Thalamocortical neurons were identified by a spike collision, and exhibited 2 distinct types of task-related activity: 1) a sustained change in activity during the instructed preparation period in response to the instruction cues (set-related activity); and 2) phasic changes in activity during the reaction and movement time periods (movement-related activity). A number of set- and moment-related neurons exhibited direction selectivity. Most movement-related neurons were similarly active, irrespective of the different sensory modalities of the cue for movement. These properties of neuronal activity were similar, regardless of their target cortical motor areas. There were no significant differences in the antidromic latencies of neurons that projected to the primary and nonprimary motor areas. These results suggest that the thalamocortical neurons play an important role in the preparation for, and initiation and execution of, the movements, but are less important than neurons of the nonprimary cortical motor areas in modality-selective sensorimotor transformation.

Although this leads to a rapid succession of discontinuous and fragmented retinal snapshots, we perceive the world as stable and coherent. Neural mechanisms underlying visual stability may depend on internal monitoring of planned or ongoing eye movements. In the macaque brain, a pathway for the transmission of such signals has been identified that is relayed by central thalamic nuclei. Here, we studied a possible role of this pathway for perceptual stability in a patient with a selective lesion affecting homologous regions of the human thalamus. Compared with controls, the patient exhibited a unilateral deficit in monitoring his eye movements. This deficit was manifest by a systematic inaccuracy both in successive eye movements and in judging the locations of visual stimuli. In addition, perceptual consequences of oculomotor targeting errors were erroneously attributed to external stimulus changes. These findings show that the human brain draws on transthalamic monitoring signals to bridge the perceptual discontinuities generated by our eye movements.;"[Ostendorf, Florian; Liebermann, Daniela; Ploner, Christoph J.] Charite, Dept Neurol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Liebermann, Daniela] Charite, Ctr Stroke Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany";"Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Ostendorf, F (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Neurol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;florian.ostendorf@charite.de;"Ostendorf, Florian/E-8342-2013; Ostendorf, Florian/AAE-1348-2019";"Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530";German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GW0653];German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF));We are very grateful to N.P.

Lesions of the anterior thalamus in macaques produce impairments which resemble those seen after lesions of the fornix-mamillary pathway, which carries projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus, while lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, which receives inputs from frontal and temporal cortex, produce moderate impairments on a wider range of memory tasks. In the present study, we have made bilateral excitotoxic lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus, or both, in marmoset monkeys. Monkeys with lesions of both thalamic nuclei were severely impaired on retention and new learning of examples of the visuospatial conditional task, a task which is specifically impaired by lesions of the fornix or hippocampus. They were not impaired on performance of a visuovisual conditional task on which monkeys with hippocampal lesions are impaired, nor were they impaired on any visual discrimination task, including the concurrent discrimination task on which monkeys with temporal neocortical ablations are impaired. Monkeys with separate lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus were not impaired on any of these tasks. These results suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus and the anterior thalamus are both involved in processing the output of the hippocampal-fornix-thalamic circuit. Dense amnesia may result from damage to circuits additional to the temporal lobe efferents to either the anterior or the mediodorsal nuclei. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the caudorostral dimension, stepwise serial projections convey information through the primary, rostral, and rostrotemporal (AI, R, and RT) core areas on the supratemporal plane, continuing to the rostrotemporal polar area (RTp) and adjacent auditory-related areas of the rostral superior temporal gyrus (STGr) and temporal pole. In addition to this cascade of corticocortical connections, the auditory cortex receives parallel thalamocortical projections from the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Previous studies have examined the projections from MGN to auditory cortex, but most have focused on the caudal core areas AI and R. In this study, we investigated the full extent of connections between MGN and AI, R, RT, RTp, and STGr using retrograde and anterograde anatomical tracers. Both AI and R received nearly 90% of their thalamic inputs from the ventral subdivision of the MGN (MGv; the primary/lemniscal auditory pathway). By contrast, RT received only approximate to 45% from MGv, and an equal share from the dorsal subdivision (MGd). Area RTp received approximate to 25% of its inputs from MGv, but received additional inputs from multisensory areas outside the MGN (30% in RTp vs. 1-5% in core areas). The MGN input to RTp distinguished this rostral extension of auditory cortex from the adjacent auditory-related cortex of the STGr, which received 80% of its thalamic input from multisensory nuclei (primarily medial pulvinar).

We examined the reliability of this marker in identifying and discriminating thalamic terminals in adult and developing ferret visual cortex. We studied brain sections stained for the transporter protein and/or anterogradely filled thalamocortical or intracortical axons, by using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Under light microscopy, VGluT2 immunoreactivity (ir) in adult animals [past postnatal day (P)90] and in neonatal animals as early as P27 formed a dense band in layer 4 and appeared as scattered puncta in layers 6 and 1. Confocal dual-labeling analyses of P46 and adult striate cortices indicated that VGluT2 was present in thalamocortical axons, suggesting that thalamic projections utilize this transporter during postnatal development as well as adulthood. In contrast, extracellularly filled intracortical axons failed to colocalize with VGluT2-ir, suggesting that no significant terminal population originating in cortex contained VGluT2 in layer 4. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that, in adult layer 4, VGluT2-ir was present in large terminals, forming asymmetric synapses. Similar to anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals, VGluT2-ir synaptic terminals were different from their unlabeled counterparts in terms of terminal area (0.6 vs. 0.3 mu m), synaptic length (486 vs. 353 nm), and preference for synapsing on spines (77% vs. 59%). Moreover, no significant differences were found between VGluT2-ir and anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals. Comparable similarities were also demonstrated at P46. These results indicate that thalamocortical terminals in layer 4 of visual cortex utilize VGluT2 and suggest that this marker can be used to identify thalamic axons specifically in adult and developing animals.

Damage to the medial, magnocellular part of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impairs cognitive functions dependent on prefrontal cortex, including memory. The contribution of MDmc to other aspects of cognition dependent on prefrontal cortex has not been determined. The ability of monkeys to adjust their choice behavior in response to changes in reinforcer value, a capacity impaired by lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, can be tested in a reinforcer devaluation paradigm. In the present study, rhesus monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic MDmc lesions were tested in the devaluation procedure. Monkeys learned visual discrimination problems in which each rewarded object is reliably paired with one of two different food rewards and then were given choices between pairs of rewarded objects, one associated with each food. Selective satiation of one of the food rewards reduces choices of objects associated with that food in normal monkeys. Monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of MDmc learned concurrently presented visual discrimination problems as quickly as unoperated control monkeys but showed impaired reinforcer devaluation effects.

The German parcellation and terminology has been mostly used for the human thalamus in neurosurgery atlases; the Anglo-American parcellation and terminology is the most used in experimental research on the primate thalamus. In this article, we review the historical development of terminological and parcellation schemes for the primate thalamus over the last 200 years.

Neurons were counted in this same nucleus, allowing the magnification functions (cells/degree(2) as functions of eccentricity) of magnocellular and parvocellular layers to be determined after eliminating the effects of nonuniform volume shrinkage. Parvocellular magnification was approximately 10,000 times higher in the foveola than in the far periphery. On average, magnocellular neurons made up 2.6% of the LGN in the central 2 degrees (but probably a smaller fraction in the central fovea). The magnocellular portion increased steadily with eccentricity to 27% in the far periphery. Thus the magno/parvo ratio increases from foveola to far periphery by a factor of at least 14. The parvocellular magnification function matches estimates of cortical magnification, whereas the density of magnocellular afferents to cortex increases monotonically with eccentricity. At the posterior pole of the nucleus, the numbers of layers are reduced through a fusion of two layers and the disappearance of one or two others, a feature that may be associated with the foveal ipsilateral hemifield representation.

Behavioural investigation of the effects of these disconnections gives information that cannot be derived either from clinical studies or from the effects of bilateral symmetrical ablations in the monkey. Disconnection experiments are particularly suited to the study of the interactions between the components of widespread cortical networks. We propose that memory acquisition is dependent on plastic cortical changes that are widespread, rather than limited to the medial temporal lobe. Further, memory acquisition depends on cortical-subcortical interactions to a greater extent than memory retrieval does. Prefrontal cortex, we suggest, is specifically important in the representation of temporally complex events. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson Srl. All rights reserved.;"[Gaffan, David; Wilson, Charles R.

According to the theory conscious mechanisms are associated with behavioural diversity, whereas unconscious output is proposed to have an obligatory association with stereotypical behaviour. The respective processes are by definition a function of the type of reafferent motor input. Concepts of simple and complex premotor networks are introduced as a means of describing unconscious and conscious processes, respectively. Evidence shows that unconscious cognitive performance differs qualitatively from conscious mechanisms suggesting parallel processes. Although the postulated anatomical substrates for conscious and unconscious processes will function in this model as parallel segregated networks, it is proposed they are distributed throughout the same cortical areas of the brain. Motor reafference is postulated to be mediated via pallidal projections to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which is known to modulate thalamocortical pathways. The role of the koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus remains an enigma and has some properties in common with the well-described magnocellular and parvocellular projections. There is also much speculation about the intralaminar and midline nuclei, the so-called non-specific thalamus. The paper will examine the distinctive features of thalamocortical networks and the role of the koniocellular pathway and intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus and suggest that they form a neuroanatomical substrate for the categorizing of unconscious cognitive processes. The ILN has unique projections back to the basal ganglia, which could serve in constraining associated neocortical networks with stereotypical behaviour and thus putative unconscious processing. Only after establishing such a theoretical framework can one hope to successfully analyze the empirical literature on the syndrome of blindsight, of which a detailed account is presented. Blindsight refers to the apparent visual abilities of patients with damage to the striate visual cortex (VI). Patients will 'guess' the shape of an object or reach towards it when presented in the blind field, in spite of denying actually seeing it, i.e., they are unconsciously aware of it. Unlike the magnocellular and parvocellular geniculate pathways the koniocellular extrastriate projections partially conserve retinal information in these patients. Could the proposed network represent an anatomical model of the Freudian subconscious? (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly, we study whether sources of coherent scattering could contribute to variability of estimates of the effective scatterer size, ESS, used to detect neurotoxic effects of anesthesia. This characterization is performed by computing the generalized spectrum, the echo-amplitude signal-to-noise ratio, and the echo phase histogram nonuniformity, and comparing their values to those obtained from a reference material with diffuse scattering conditions. Results show that scattering conditions in the thalamus can be described mostly as originating from a low scatterer number density (38% of data) and the presence of specular reflectors (36%). Only 23% of the data presented diffuse scattering conditions. Specular reflectors were more likely found in data that showed inconclusive results in a previous ESS analysis of the effects of anesthesia.

The known connections of areas 4 and 3b differ substantially, as does the information which they receive, process, and transfer to other parts of the central nervous system. In this analysis the thalamic projections to each of these three cortical fields were examined and compared by using retrogradely transported fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, Rhodamine and Green latex microspheres) as neuron labels. Coincident labeling of projections to 2-3 cortical sites in each monkey allowed the direct comparison of the soma distributions within the thalamic space of the different neuron populations projecting to areas 3a, 3b, and 4, as well as to boundary zones between these cortical fields. The soma distribution of thalamic neurons projecting to a small circumscribed zone (diameter = 0.5-1.0 mm) strictly within cortical area 3a (in region of hand representation) filled out a ''territory'' traversing the dorsal half of the cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus, VPLc (abbreviations as in Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. Basel: Karger). This elongate, rather cylindrical, territory extended caudally into the anterior pulvinar nucleus, but not forward into VPLo. The rostrocaudal extent of the thalamic territory defining the soma distribution of neurons projecting to small zones of cortical area 3b was similar, but typically extended into the ventral part of VPLc, filling out a medially concavo-convex laminar space. Two such territories projecting to adjacent zones of areas 3a and 3b, respectively, overlapped and shared thalamic space, but not thalamic neurons. Contrasting with the 3a and 3b thalamic territories, the soma distribution of thalamic neurons projecting to a circumscribed zone in the nearby motor cortex (area 4) did not penetrate into VPLc, but instead filled out a mediolaterally flattened territory extending from rostral VLo, VLm, VPLo to caudal and dorsal VLc, LP, and Pul.o. These territories skirted around VPLc. All three cortical areas 4, 3a, and 3b) also received input from distinctive clusters of cells in the intralaminar Cn.Md. It is inferred that, in combination, the thalamic territories enveloping those neuron somas projecting to, say, the sensorimotor hand representation in areas 3a, 3b, and 4 (and also areas 1 and 2), which would be coactive during the execution of a manual task, constituted a lamellar space extending from VLo rostrally to Pul.o caudally. How Pul.o neuron populations relate to the more rostral populations within the same thalamic territory projecting to a localized cortical zone remains uncertain. Within the medially located territories the distribution of the neuron population in Pul.o was spatially continuous with the more rostral thalamic cells projecting to the same localized cortex, but in lateral thalamic territories these 2 populations were usually spatially discontinuous. In the newborn macaque an orderly change in the territorial projections to localized zones in areas 4, 3a, and 3b was also demonstable. However, thalamic nuclear projections were more expansive than in the mature animal. As well as the VPLc input, a third of the thalamic input to area 3a was now from VLo, VPLo, and VLm. Area 4 also had a significant input from VPLc, an input not observed in the mature macaque.

Multisensory neurons tuned to both vestibular and visual motion (optic flow) signals are found in several cortical areas in the dorsal visual stream. Here we examine whether such convergence occurs subcortically in the macaque thalamus. We searched the ventral posterior nuclei, including the anterior pulvinar, as well as the ventro-lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, areas that receive vestibular signals from brain stem and deep cerebellar nuclei. Approximately a quarter of cells responded to three-dimensional (3D) translational and/or rotational motion. More than half of the responsive cells were convergent, thus responded during both rotation and translation. The preferred axes of translation/rotation were distributed throughout 3D space. The majority of the neurons were excited, but some were inhibited, during rotation/translation in darkness. Only a couple of neurons were multisensory being tuned to both vestibular and optic flow stimuli. We conclude that multisensory vestibular/optic flow neurons, which are commonly found in cortical visual and visuomotor areas, are rare in the ventral posterior thalamus.";"[Meng, Hui; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";Washington University (WUSTL);Angelaki, DE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Box 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;angelaki@wustl.edu;;;National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01-DC-04260];National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));Experiments were supported by National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Grant R01-DC-04260.;;65;28;28;0;7;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

In addition to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of MD, three other subdivisions can be recognized on the basis of myeloarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and connections. The first two of these represent a parcellation of the magnocellular division into a lateral, fiber-rich MD pars fibrosa and a medial, poorly myelinated MD pars paramediana adjacent to the midline. The third is a small, poorly myelinated area located at the caudomedial and dorsal edges of MD; it is referred to as MD pars caudodorsalis. MD pars fibrosa is reciprocally interconnected primarily with areas 11, 12 and 13 in the central and lateral part of the orbital cortex. There is a general organization within this projection, with the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex represented from dorsal to ventral in the pars fibrosa, and the mediolateral cortical axis represented from medial to lateral. Cells that project to area 12 also extend laterally into the adjacent pars parvicellularis. MD pars paramediana is more heavily interconnected with the caudal and medial portions of the orbital region, particularly the agranular insular areas and the caudal parts of areas 13 and 14. Cells that project to two caudal areas' 13a and Iad, do not fit with the general organization, in that they are located in the dorsomedial parts of the pars fibrosa and pars paramediana, where they overlap with cells that project to area 14. The pars fibrosa and pars paramediana receive inputs from areas of the ventral forebrain such as the amygdala, piriform (olfactory) cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, as well as from the ventral pallidum. MD pars caudodorsalis is reciprocally interconnected with areas 14, 24, and 32 on the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex. In this part of the nucleus the dorsoventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is represented from caudal to rostral in the thalamus. The amygdala and other ventral forebrain structures do not send fibers into the pars caudodorsalis, even though some of these structures project directly to the medial prefrontal cortex. Ventral to MD, and separated from it by the internal medullary lamina, a small region was recognized that appears to be comparable to the anteroventral part of the submedial nucleus previously defined in the rat and cat. This region receives input from the piriform cortex and is interconnected with orbital cortical area 13a.

Counts were made in 10-mu-m-thick frozen sections and in 1-mu-m-thick plastic sections and stereological formulae applied to obtain an accurate assessment of the volumetric density of GABA cells in the nuclei. It was found that GABA-immunoreactive cells account for at least 27% of the cells per unit area of all the thalamic nuclei investigated and up to as much as 50% by unit volume. The intralaminar nuclei show only slightly fewer GABA cells than the principal relay nuclei. Previous reports of their absence or relatively low numbers in the intralaminar nuclei probably stem from their smaller size, relatively weaker immunoreactive staining and from failure to apply sterometric formulae that reveal the density of neurons per volume of tissue. These results suggest that the cellular elements of the intralaminar nuclei are not fundamentally different from those of the principal relay nuclei of the thalamus.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;;Hunt, C.

The responses of neurons in this area are not critically dependent on inputs from the primary visual cortex (VC), as lesions of VC leave neuronal response properties in PMLS relatively unchanged (Spear & Baumann, 1979; Spear, 1988; Guido et al., 1990b). However, previous studies have used a limited range of visual stimuli. In this study, we assessed whether neurons in PMLS cortex remained direction-selective to complex motion stimuli following a lesion of VC, particularly to complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Unilateral aspiration of VC was performed on post-natal days 7-9. Single unit extracellular recordings were performed one year later in the ipsilateral PMLS cortex. As in previous studies, a reduction in the percentage of direction selective neurons was observed with drifting sinewave gratings. We report a previously unobserved phenomenon with sinewave gratings, in which there is a greater modulation of firing rate at the temporal frequency of the stimulus in animals with a lesion of VC, suggesting an increased segregation of ON and OFF sub-regions. A significant portion of neurons in PMLS cortex were direction selective to simple (16/18) and complex (11/16) RDKs. However, the strength of direction selectivity to both stimuli was reduced as compared to normals. The data suggest that complex motion processing is still present, albeit reduced, in PMLS cortex despite the removal of VC input. The complex RDK motion selectivity is consistent with both geniculo-cortical and extra-geniculate thalamo-cortical pathways in residual direction encoding.";"Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, Ecole Optometrie, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada";"Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal";Casanova, C (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.;christian.casanova@umontreal.ca;"Boire, Denis/I-4530-2019; Ptito, Maurice/G-3422-2013";"Boire, Denis/0000-0001-5614-4976; Ptito, Maurice/0000-0002-5173-5862";;;;;74;4;5;0;0;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN-FEB;2007;24;1;;;;;53;64;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523807070095;;;12;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";163LO;17430609;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000246161500006;View Full Record in Web of Science

While Aggleton and Brown (1999) suggested a role for recognition and not recall, Van der Werf et al. (2003) suggested that this nucleus is functionally related to executive function and strategic retrieval, based on its connections to the prefrontal cortices (PFC). The present study used a lesion approach including patients with focal thalamic lesions to examine the functions of the MD, the intralaminar nuclei and the midline nuclei in memory processing. A newly designed pair association task was used, which allowed the assessment of recognition and cued recall performance. Volume loss in thalamic nuclei was estimated as a predictor for alterations in memory performance. Patients performed poorer than healthy controls on recognition accuracy and cued recall. Furthermore, patients responded slower than controls specifically on recognition trials followed by successful cued recall of the paired associate. Reduced recall of picture pairs and increased response times during recognition followed by cued recall covaried with the volume loss in the parvocellular MD. This pattern suggests a role of this thalamic region in recall and thus recollection, which does not fit the framework proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). The functional specialization of the parvocellular MD accords with its connectivity to the dorsolateral PFC, highlighting the role of this thalamocortical network in explicit memory (Van der Werf et al., 2003).

However, little is known about the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the auditory system of macaque monkeys. In this study, we examined the overall distribution of cell bodies that expressed mRNAs for VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 (markers for glutamatergic neurons), GAD67 (a marker for GABAergic neurons), and GLYT2 (a marker for glycinergic neurons) in the auditory system of the Japanese macaque. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GAD67 in order to compare the distribution of proteins and mRNAs. We found that most of the excitatory neurons in the auditory brainstem expressed VGLUT2. In contrast, the expression of VGLUT1 mRNA was restricted to the auditory cortex (AC), periolivary nuclei, and cochlear nuclei (CN). The co-expression of GAD67 and GLYT2 mRNAs was common in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), CN, and superior olivary complex except for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which expressed GLYT2 alone. In contrast, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and AC expressed GAD67 alone. The absence of co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the medial geniculate, medial superior olive, and VNLL suggests that synaptic responses in the target neurons of these nuclei may be different between rodents and macaque monkeys.

Reduction of thalamic neurons, a key feature of the neuropathology of schizophrenia, could also have a prenatal origin via disruption of thalamic neurogenesis. This study investigates whether craniofacial dysmorphology and thalamic neuron loss might be associated manifestations of a disruption in embryonic development. Methods: Thalamic neurons were deleted by exposing fetal macaques to x-rays during thalamic genesis (E3342). Another group of macaques was irradiated after thalamic genesis (E70-81). Body, head, and facial measurements were obtained from the early irradiated (EX), late irradiated (LX), and control animals at adulthood. Results: Head width, distance between outer eye edges, and ear width were smaller in EX macaques compared with control animals. The LX macaques exhibited only reduced ear width compared with control animals. Conclusions: These findings indicate that certain features of thalamic neuropathology and craniofacial dysmorphogenesis observed in schizophrenic patients may have a common etiology.

We test the hypothesis that SIV-infection produces proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI)-observed decline in the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and elevations in the glial marker, myo-inositol (mI), and associated creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) in these structures.Design:Pre- and 4-6 weeks post-SIV infection (with CD8(+) T-lymphocyte depletion) was monitored with T-2-weighted quantitative MRI and 16x16x4 multivoxel H-1-MRSI (TE/TR=33/1400ms) in the brains of five rhesus macaques.Methods:Exploiting the high-resolution H-1-MRSI grid, we obtained absolute, cerebrospinal fluid partial volume-corrected NAA, Cr, Cho and mI concentrations from centrum semiovale, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus regions.Results:Pre- to post-infection mean Cr increased in the thalamus: 7.20.4 to 8.0 +/- 0.8mmol/l (+11%, P<0.05); mI increased in the centrum semiovale: 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 0.8mmol/l, caudate: 5.7 +/- 0.7 to 7.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l, thalamus: 6.8 +/- 0.8 to 8.5 +/- 0.8mmol/l and hippocampus: 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.4mmol/l (+29%, +27%, +24% and +29%, all P<0.05). NAA and Cho changes were not significant.Conclusion:SIV-infection appears to cause brain injury indirectly, through glial activation, while the deep gray matter structures' neuronal cell bodies are relatively spared. Treatment regimens to reduce gliosis may, therefore, prevent neuronal damage and its associated neurocognitive impairment.

Next to reviewing the role of beta oscillations in human beat perception, here we discuss the role of primate putaminal oscillatory activity in the control of rhythmic movements that are guided by a sensory metronome or internally gated. The analysis of the local field potentials of the behaving macaques showed that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing of the metronome, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, during internally driven rhythmic tapping. Thus, this review emphasizes the need of parametric neurophysiological observations in non-human primates that display a well-controlled behavior during high-level cognitive processes.;"[Merchant, Hugo; Bartolo, Ramon] UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico; [Bartolo, Ramon] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, SLDM, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Merchant, H (corresponding author), UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico.;hugomerchant@unam.mx;"Merchant, Hugo/E-8703-2019; Bartolo, Ramon/AAB-6579-2022";"Merchant, Hugo/0000-0002-3488-9501; Bartolo, Ramon/0000-0003-2165-9747";"CONACYT [236836, 196]; PAPIIT [IN202317]";"CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT))";We thank Yaneri Ayala and Dobromir Dotov for their fruitful comments on the manuscript.

Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.

Collinear flankers can enhance or decrease the perceptual and neuronal sensitivity to flanked stimuli. These effects are mediated through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), in conjunction with feedback from higher visual areas. The strength of lateral interactions is affected by cholinergic neuromodulation. Blockade of muscarinic receptors should increase the strength of lateral intracortical interactions, while nicotinic blockade should reduce thalamocortical feed-forward drive. Here we test this proposal through local iontophoretic application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, while recording single cells in parafoveal representations in awake fixating macaque V1. Collinear flankers generally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptor blockade equally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Contrary to our hypothesis, flanker interactions were not systematically affected by either receptor blockade.;"[Herrero, Jose L.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, New York, NY USA; [Thiele, Alexander] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Henry Wellcome Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England";"Northwell Health; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";Thiele, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Henry Wellcome Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.;alex.thiele@ncl.ac.uk;;;"BBSRC [BBS/B/09325]; Wellcome Trust [070380/z/03/z]; MRC [G0700976]; MRC [G0700976] Funding Source: UKRI";"BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";This work was supported by the BBSRC (BBS/B/09325), the Wellcome Trust (070380/z/03/z), and the MRC (G0700976) and by the excellent technical support by the CBC.;;70;0;0;0;0;NATURE PORTFOLIO;BERLIN;HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY;2045-2322;;;SCI REP-UK;Sci Rep;Apr 16;2021;11;1;;;;;;;8384;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88044-7;;;15;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;RP5WR;33863988;gold, Green Published;;;19.07.23;WOS:000641799700015;View Full Record in Web of Science

Schizophrenia is associated with reductions in thalamic neuronal number and cortical gray matter volume. Exposure of nonhuman primates to x-irradiation in early gestation has previously been shown to decrease thalamic volume and neuronal number. Here we examine whether early gestational irradiation also results in cortical volume reduction. Methods: High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult monkeys 1) exposed to irradiation during the early gestational period (E33-E42) corresponding to thalamic neurogenesis, 2) irradiated in midgestation (E70-81) during neocortical neurogenesis, and 3) not exposed to irradiation. Cortical gray matter and white matter volumes were derived via manual segmentation, frontal and nonfrontal volumes were distinguisbed via sulcal landmarks. Results: Monkeys irradiated in early gestation exhibited a trend reduction in nonfrontal gray matter volume (17%) and significant reductions in white matter volume in frontal (26%) and nonfrontal (36%) lobes. Monkeys irradiated in midgestation had smaller gray (frontal 28%; nonfrontal. 22% and white matter (frontal 29%; nonfrontal- 38%) volumes. Conclusions: The cortical deficits observed in midgestationally irradiated monkeys are consistent with a reduction in cortical neuronal number. Cortical volume reductions following early gestational irradiation may be secondary to reduced thalamic neuronal number and therefore model the thalamocortical pathology of schizophrenia.";"Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";"Yale University; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)";Selemon, LD (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, POB 208001, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;ldselemon@aol.com;"Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013; Nebel, Mary Beth/D-3305-2015; wang, le/HKN-3406-2023";"Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388; Nebel, Mary Beth/0000-0003-0185-3382; ";NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH059329, MH 62130, MH 071616, P50 MH071616, MH 44866, MH 59329, P20 MH062130] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;98;26;27;0;4;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0006-3223;1873-2402;;BIOL PSYCHIAT;Biol.

By showing that responses in visual thalamus are modulated by perceptual and cognitive tasks, recent fMRI and physiology studies have helped revise this view. The modulatory input to the visual thalamus derives from functionally distinct cortical and subcortical feedback pathways. These pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements. Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity. These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.;"[Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University";Kastner, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;skastner@princeton.edu;Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021;"Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698; Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X";"NEI [RO1 EY017699]; NIMH [RO1 MH64043]";"NEI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";We thank Marius Peelen and Ryan Mruczek for comments on the manuscript.

Infusions of lignocaine centered within VPLo caused hemiplegia during which movements of the contralateral arm rarely were performed in either task for a short period of time (similar to 5-30 min). When VT responses were produced, they had prolonged reaction times and movement times and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities compared with responses produced during the preinfusion baseline period. In contrast, those IG responses that were produced remained relatively normal. Infusions centered within area X never caused hemiplegia. The only deficits observed were an increase in reaction time and movement amplitude variability and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities during VT trials. Every other aspect of both the VT and IG movements remained unchanged. Infusions centered within VLo reduced the number of movements attempted during each block of trials. This did not appear to be due to hemiplegia, however, as voluntary movements easily could be elicited outside of the trained tasks. The other main deficit resulting from inactivation of VLo was an increased reaction time in the VT task. Finally, infusions centered within VApc caused IG movements to become slower and smaller in amplitude, whereas VT movements remained unchanged. Control infusions with saline did not cause any consistent deficits. This pattern of results implies that VPLo and VLo play a role in the production of movements in general regardless of the context under which they are performed. They also suggest that VPLo contributes more specifically to the execution of movements that are visually triggered and guided, whereas area X contributes specifically to the initiation of such movements. In contrast, VApc appears to play a role in the execution of movements based on internal cues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that specific subcircuits within the cerebello- and basal ganglio-thalamo-cortical systems preferentially contribute to movements based on external versus internal cues.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3PT, England";"University of Oxford; University of Oxford";van Donkelaar, P (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, 112C Esslinger Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;;Miall, R.

In unoperated animals, the region of VPL representing the hand was characterized by relatively dense and homogeneous CO staining throughout the rostral-caudal extent of VPL. Counts of neurons in the VPL hand representation from adjacent thalamic sections processed for Nissl and GABA immunostaining indicated that there were approximately 261.4 neurons/mm(2) of which 78.4/mm(2) stained positive for GABA. GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were readily apparent throughout the VPL. By contrast, animals that received total removals of the postcentral hand representations showed a dramatic reduction in CO staining in the VPL, which was confined to the expected location of the thalamic hand representation. Counts of neurons in the affected region from adjacent sections that underwent Nissl staining and GABA immunostaining also revealed a dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons, with a smaller reduction in the number of neurons staining positive for GABA. Specifically, large to medium-sized (> 180 mu m(2)) GABA(-) neurons were virtually eliminated in the affected portion of the VPL, and the numbers of GABA(+) neurons were significantly reduced. The remaining population of GABA(+) neurons was typically shrunken, and no GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were observed in the affected region. The results obtained after subtotal ablation of the postcentral hand representations (only one postcentral area spared, 3b or 3a) differed from those obtained when total removals were made. Instead of virtually complete degeneration of medium-sized to large neurons throughout the hand representation in VPL, as was the case with total removals, after partial removals, we found alternating regions in the VPL hand representation that appeared qualitatively normal, or dramatically degenerated. Thalamic sections stained with CO revealed light, moderate, and darkly stained patches of label within the hand representation in VP, depending on the type of cortical ablation. The most dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons coincided precisely with the lightest staining CO patches. Interestingly, the only statistically significant reduction in the number of GABA(+) neurons occurred in the light CO patches. In the thalamic regions coincident with the dark and moderately stained CO patches, the number of medium-sized and large neurons decreased, but the number of GABA(+) neurons was comparable to normal. Optical density measurements of the dark patches also indicated a statistically significant difference from normal CO staining in this region. These findings indicate that following cortical damage, complex changes occur in thalamic circuitry. Interestingly, these changes are not confined to regions of the thalamus that have their major projection to the damaged region of cortex, but include thalamic regions in which the major projection is to undamaged regions of cortex. Thus, relatively restricted cortical damage has the potential to affect regions of cortex not directly damaged, through post-injury changes in thalamic circuitry. Such changes in neuronal circuitry, especially at the thalamocortical level, may serve as the neural substrate for the limited recovery of behavioral function often seen after strokes or head injury.

Although it is suggested that this pathway is affected in schizophrenia, there is a lack of functional and structural data regarding its synaptic organization. The scope of this study was to characterize the ultrastructural features of thalamocortical synapses formed by afferents from the MD by applying anterograde tract tracing, immunohistochemical detection of parvalbumin (PV, a probable marker of thalamocortical endings), and quantitative electron microscopic techniques to the PFC of the macaque monkey. Our findings indicate that anterogradely-labeled and PV-immunoreactive boutons exhibit similar ultrastructural properties, characterized by their larger size, higher incidence of release sites and a higher occurrence of mitochondria when compared to non-labeled, excitatory-like endings in the middle layers of the PFC. Although most of the contacts were made on spines in both cases, PV-immunopositive axon terminals apparently targeted dendritic shafts at about twice the frequency found for anterogradely-labeled afferents from the MD (20.5% and 9.5%, respectively). This result suggests diversity among thalamocortical and/or PV-immunoreactive axon terminals of the PFC. In accordance with studies in other cortical areas, our findings suggest that corollary discharge through the mediodorsal thalamocortical projection is also adapted to synaptic transmission with high efficacy and probably exhibits marked short-term temporal dynamics in the PFC.;"Hungarian Acad Sci, United Res Org, Neurobiol Res Grp, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary; Semmelweis Univ, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Semmelweis University; Yale University";Negyessy, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, United Res Org, Neurobiol Res Grp, Tuzolto U 58, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary.;negyessy@ana.sote.hu;"Négyessy, László/C-9632-2012; Négyessy, László/G-6283-2019";Négyessy, László/0000-0002-4369-0406;NIMH NIH HHS [MH38546, MH44866] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;35;24;24;0;4;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

On the basis of its connectivity and physiology, this nucleus has been implicated in the control of saccadic eye movements, Because of the complexity of its afferent signals and its simple efferent signal, there must be much local interaction within the ZI to integrate these various afferents, The purpose of this study was to investigate, at the ultrastructural level, whether the ZI contains the anatomical substrata which could subserve the control of eye movements, Methods: Blocks of tissue from the ZI of macaque monkeys were prepared for electron microscopy using standard techniques. Some of these animals were taken specifically for electron microscopy, Others had received injections of tracer substances and were prepared for electron microscopy subsequent to tracer visualization, Results: Cell bodies of medium-large neurons were found in our preparations, They have large nucleoli and relatively small volumes of karyoplasm, Cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes have many synaptic contacts, Three types of synaptic profiles were found, designated Types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 profiles are symmetrical and contact cell bodies and small dendrites. Spe 2 profiles are thought to be presynaptic dendrites and may have symmetrical or asymmetrical contacts, Type 3 profiles are asymmetrical and primarily contact small dendrites, Many synapses contacted vesicle-containing profiles, In some cases, it was clear that these profiles participated in serial synapses on presumptive presynaptic dendrites, Other profiles appeared to be axoaxonic contacts, Conclusions: Afferent and efferent signals are Likely to be modulated extensively within the ZI. Therefore, there needs to be complex interactions between neuronal elements of the ZI and its afferents, This study demonstrates that this nucleus possesses the structural substrata to subserve diverse roles, such as the gating of saccadic eye movements.

The mediodorsal thalamus receives a large projection from the rhinal cortex, and has been implicated in recognition memory performance. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier studies, then examined the effect of bilaterally ablating the medial portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Mediodorsal lesion impaired postoperative delayed matching-to-sample performance with a large stimulus set, but had no effect on performance of DMS with a small stimulus population. In comparison with the earlier data from rhinal cortex lesions with the same methods, wherever a deficit was seen in the rhinal-lesioned animals the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals showed a smaller deficit.

Our study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the perceptual parsing and grouping of complex repeating auditory patterns that occur based solely on statistical regularities, or context. Human psychophysical studies suggest that the recognition of novel auditory patterns amid a continuous auditory stimulus sequence occurs automatically halfway through the first repetition. We hypothesized that once repeating patterns were detected by the brain, internal rhythms would become entrained, demarcating the temporal structure of these repetitions despite lacking external cues defining pattern on- or offsets. To examine the neural correlates of pattern perception, neuroelectric activity of primary auditory cortex (A1) and thalamic nuclei was recorded while nonhuman primates passively listened to streams of rapidly presented pure tones and bandpass noise bursts. At arbitrary intervals, random acoustic patterns composed of 11 stimuli were repeated five times without any perturbance of the constant stimulus flow. We found significant delta entrainment by these patterns in the A1, medial geniculate body, and medial pulvinar. In A1 and pulvinar, we observed a statistically significant, pattern structure-aligned modulation of neuronal firing that occurred earliest in the pulvinar, supporting the idea that grouping and detecting complex auditory patterns is a top-down, context-driven process. Besides electrophysiological measures, a pattern-related modulation of pupil diameter verified that, like humans, nonhuman primates consciously detect complex repetitive patterns that lack physical boundaries.;"[Barczak, Annamaria; O'Connell, Monica Noelle; McGinnis, Tammy; Ross, Deborah; Falchier, Arnaud; Lakatos, Peter] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Mowery, Todd] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lakatos, Peter] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; New York University";"Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Lakatos, P (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA.";Peter.Lakatos@NKI.rfmh.org;;"Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Falchier, Arnaud/0000-0003-2426-3975; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021";"NIH from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC012947]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH109289]";"NIH from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders; National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";Support for this work was provided by NIH Grants R01DC012947 from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and R01MH109289 from the National Institute of Mental Health.;;88;36;36;0;7;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Material was obtained from brains cut in the frontal, horizontal, and parasagittal planes. Our results indicate that the ventrolateral thalamic region (VL) of owl monkeys is a heterogeneous structure composed of several architectonic subdivisions that resemble divisions that have been described in macaques and other Old World anthropoids. All of these subdivisions are more readily distinguished in AChE than in Nissl or CO preparations. The anterior part of VL, VLa (VLo of Olszewski), is characterized by clusters of medium-sized, darkly stained neurons. VLa is also distinguished by AChE-positive cells embedded in a matrix of neurites as well as by a characteristic dark, irregular net of blood vessels. The posterior part of VL is rather uniform cytoarchitectonically and contains large, darkly stained, and sparsely distributed neurons. However, we were able to distinguish three subdivisions of posterior VL that closely correspond to structures described by Olszewski in macaques: a principal segment, VLp (VPLo of Olszewski), a medial segment; VLx (''area X'' of Olszewski), and a dorsal segment, VLd (VLc and VLps of Olszewski). In AChE, VLd is much darker than the other divisions. The distinction between VLp and VLx, which together make up the largest part of VL, is less marked, although VLp is somewhat darker and more irregular in appearance in AChE than is VLx.

In the present study, similar histochemical procedures were applied to map the extent of the PI complex in humans. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and cytochrome oxidase staining demarcated four histochemical zones in human pulvinar, corresponding to the medial, central, lateral and lateral-shell (PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S) divisions of the PI complex in monkeys.

Microelectrode recording was used to generate somatosensory maps in the posterior bank of the central sulcus and on the exposed cortical surface lateral to the lateral tip of the central sulcus in Macaca nemestrina. The area innervated by the contralateral trigeminal nerve is represented in an 8-mm mediolateral extent of area 3b lateral to the representation of the hand. Lateral to this, still within area 3b, there is an expanded representation of ipsilateral intra-oral structures measuring 6 mm in mediolateral extent. Both representations fill area 3b anteroposteriorly. The ipsilateral representation forms approximately 40% of the trigeminal representation, consistent with the amount of the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic nucleus devoted to representation of ipsilateral intra-oral structures. Comparison of the present results with maps of the face representation in other species of monkey shows a consistent somatotopy of the face between species; size variations are mainly related to the enlarged ipsi- and contralateral representations of the cheek pouches in macaques. The general somatotopy of the trigeminal representation in monkeys is consistent with that in other mammalian species.

Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [ suppression index (SI) > 0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.;"Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesia, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Stanford University; Salk Institute; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Sceniak, MP (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesia, Room S288, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;sceniak@stanford.edu;Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011;"Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267; Sceniak, Michael/0000-0003-2415-5800";NEI NIH HHS [EY 01742] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;58;46;46;0;3;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques.;"[Waguespack, Hannah F.; Malkova, Ludise; Forcelli, Patrick A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,3970 Reservoir Rd NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Turchi, Janita] NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Georgetown University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Turchi, J (corresponding author), NIMH, NIH, 49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;"hgf6@georgetown.edu; malkoval@georgetown.edu; paf22@georgetown.edu; turchij@mail.nih.gov";;Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X;"Intramural Research Program of the NIMH;  [KL2TR001432];  [R01MH099505]";"Intramural Research Program of the NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); ; ";PAF received support from KL2TR001432.

In addition to the relatively well described age-associated pathologies that reduce sensory processing at the level of the cochlea and eye, multiple changes occur along the ascending auditory and visual pathways that further reduce sensory function in each domain. One fundamental question that remains to be directly addressed is whether the structure and function of the central auditory and visual systems follow similar trajectories across the lifespan or sustain the impacts of brain aging independently. The present study used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological assessments of auditory and visual system function in adult and aged macaques to better understand how age-related changes in white matter connectivity at multiple levels of each sensory system might impact auditory and visual function. In particular, the fractional anisotropy (FA) of auditory and visual system thalamocortical and interhemispheric corticocortical connections was estimated using probabilistic tractography analyses. Sensory processing and sensory system FA were both reduced in older animals compared with younger adults. Corticocortical FA was significantly reduced only in white matter of the auditory system of aged monkeys, while thalamocortical FA was lower only in visual system white matter of the same animals. Importantly, these structural alterations were significantly associated with sensory function within each domain. Together, these results indicate that age-associated deficits in auditory and visual processing emerge in part from microstructural alterations to specific sensory white matter tracts, and not from general differences in white matter condition across the aging brain.;"[Gray, Daniel T.; De La Pena, Nicole M.; Engle, James R.; Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Gray, Daniel T.; De La Pena, Nicole M.; Engle, James R.; Trouard, Theodore P.; Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Umapathy, Lavanya] Univ Arizona, Elect & Comp Engn, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Burke, Sara N.] Univ Florida, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Gainesville, FL 32609 USA; [Trouard, Theodore P.] Univ Arizona, Dept Biomed Engn, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA";"University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona";"Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.";carol@nsma.arizona.edu;", Lavanya/AAO-3619-2021; Burke, Sara N/I-5691-2019";", Lavanya/0000-0002-7224-0930; Burke, Sara N/0000-0002-1773-1294; De La Pena, Nicole/0000-0002-1302-6299";"National Institutes of Health [RO1-AG-050548, F31-AG-055263]; McKnight Brain Research Foundation; Arizona Department of Health Services";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); McKnight Brain Research Foundation; Arizona Department of Health Services";"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants RO1-AG-050548 and F31-AG-055263, the McKnight Brain Research Foundation, and the Arizona Department of Health Services.

Magnetic resonance and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.;"[Halgren, Milan; Eskandar, Emad; Cash, Sydney S.] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ulbert, Istvan; Wittner, Lucia] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan; Eross, Lorand] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Bion, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary; [Bastuji, Helene] Univ Claude Bernard, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France; [Bastuji, Helene] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonct & Epileptol, Unite Hypnol, F-69003 Lyon, France; [Fabo, Daniel] Natl Inst Clin Neurosci, Epilepsy Ctr, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary; [Eross, Lorand] Natl Inst Clin Neurosci, Dept Funct Neurosurg, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] Aix Marseille Univ, Div is Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13007 Marseille, France; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] INSERM, Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] Timone Hosp, AP HP, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Devinsky, Orrin; Doyle, Werner K.] NYU, Sch Med, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Mak-McCully, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Halgren, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci & Radiol, La Jolla, CA 93093 USA; [Heit, Gary] Permanente Med Grp Inc, Dept Neurosurg, Redwood City, CA 94063 USA; [Mandell, Arnold] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Halgren, Milan] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Eskandar, Emad] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Bronx, NY 10461 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Hotel-Dieu - APHP; New York University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Permanente Medical Groups; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine";Halgren, M (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;mhalgren@mit.edu;"Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010; Fabo, Daniel/AAM-3226-2020; Wittner, Lucia/C-9386-2013";"Fabo, Daniel/0000-0001-5141-5351; BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707; Halgren, Mila/0000-0003-2871-741X; Wittner, Lucia/0000-0001-6800-0953; Devinsky, Orrin/0000-0003-0044-4632; Eross, Lorand/0000-0002-5796-5546";"US Office of Naval Research [N00014-13-1-0672]; NIH [R01-MH-099645, R01-EB-009282, R01-NS-062092, K24-NS-088568]; Massachusetts General Hospital Executive Council on Research; Hungarian National Brain Research Program [KTIA_13_NAP-A-IV/1-4,6, 2017-1.2.1-NKP-2017-00002]; European Union Grant FP7 NeuroSeeker [600925]; Hungarian Government [OTKA PD101754, OTKA K119443]";"US Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Massachusetts General Hospital Executive Council on Research; Hungarian National Brain Research Program; European Union Grant FP7 NeuroSeeker; Hungarian Government";"We thank Erica Johnson, Nathan Meng, Richard Fiath, Qianli Xu, and Adam Niese for insightful comments, hypotheses, and technical support; and Project Tycho for making their macaque dataset publicly available.

The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it. In addition, the patches of spinothalamic terminations intermingled and partly overlapped with the cerebellothalamic, but not with the pallidothalamic terminations within VLp. The regions of overlap of somatosensory and cerebellar inputs within the VLp of the present study appear to correspond to the reported locations of the tremor-related cells in parkinsonian patients. Thus, the overlapping spinothalamic and cerebellar inputs may provide a substrate for the altered activity of motor thalamic neurons in such patients.;"Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Program Neurosci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University";Stepniewska, I (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;iwona.stepniewska@vanderbilt.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS 38564] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;84;52;53;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Whether functional connections between CG neurons and LGN relay neurons obey or ignore the separation of feedforward visual signals into parallel processing streams is not known. Accordingly, there is some debate about whether CG neurons are morphologically heterogeneous or homogenous. Here we characterized the morphology of CG neurons in the ferret, a visual carnivore with distinct feedforward parallel processing streams, and compared the morphology of ferret CG neurons with CG neuronal morphology previously described in macaque monkeys [Briggs et al. (2016) Neuron, 90, 388]. We used a G-deleted rabies virus as a retrograde tracer to label CG neurons in adult ferrets. We then reconstructed complete dendritic morphologies for a large sample of virus-labeled CG neurons. Quantification of CG morphology revealed three distinct CG neuronal subtypes with striking similarities to the CG neuronal subtypes observed in macaques. These findings suggest that CG neurons may be morphologically diverse in a variety of highly visual mammals in which feedforward visual pathways are organized into parallel processing streams. Accordingly, these results provide support for the notion that CG feedback is functionally parallel stream-specific in ferrets and macaques.;"[Hasse, J.

Anatomical and physiological results were later related to histological distinctions in the same brains after sections were processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), or cytochrome oxidase (CO). The experiments produced several major findings. (1) Neurons throughout a broad expanse of cortex were highly responsive to pure tones, and best frequencies could be determined for neurons in arrays of recording sites. (2) The microelectrode recordings revealed two systematic representations of tone frequencies, the primary area (AI) and a primary-like rostral field (R) as previously described. The representation of high to low frequency tones in A1 was largely caudorostral along the plane of the sulcus. A reversal of the order of representation of frequencies occurred in R. (3) AI and R together were coextensive with a koniocellular, densely myelinated zone that expressed high levels of AchE and CO. These architectonic features were somewhat less pronounced in R than AI, but a clear border between the two areas was not apparent. (4) Cortex bordering AI and R was less responsive to tones, but when best frequencies for neurons could be determined, they matched those for adjoining parts of AI and R. (5) Architectonically distinct regions were apparent within some of the cortex bordering AI and R. (6) The major ipsilateral cortical connections of AI were with R and cortex immediately lateral and medial to AI. (7) Callosal connections of AI were predominately with matched locations in the opposite AI, but they also included adjoining fields. (8) Neurons in the ventral (MG(V)), medial (MG(M)), and dorsal (MG(D)) nuclei of the medial geniculate complex projected to AI and cortex lateral to AI. (9) Injections in cortex responsive to high frequency tones labeled more dorsal parts of MG(V) than injections in cortex responsive to low frequency tones.

Methods: Nissl-stained sections were examined to determine the boundaries of, and the distribution of neuronal sizes within, the medial pulvinar, In addition, Golgi-impregnated neurons were examined and drawn for analysis, Only rhesus monkey specimens were used, and the material had been prepared previously for other studies. Results: Projection neurons have round to oval somata and moderate numbers of primary dendrites that extend for short distances before branching into many secondary branches, Two variations of projection neurons (P1 and P2) were distinguished on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic tree, Both varieties have short dendrites that radiate in all directions, They differ in that P2 cells have longer second tier dendrites than P1 cells, Three types of local circuit neurons, tufted, radiating and varicose, were distinguished on the basis of their dendritic morphology, Four types of afferent fibers were identified. Type 1 afferents form cone-shape terminal arbors. Type 2 afferents are similar to those reported for retinal or cortical terminals, Type 3 afferents are of medium thickness and of an unknown origin, Type 4 afferents are thin and have small varicosities consistent with previously described cortical afferents, Afferent fibers are predominantly oriented along the mediolateral axis of the nucleus. We observed putative contacts between some afferents and local circuit neurons and between local circuit neurons and projection neurons, Conclusions: Medial pulvinar neurons are generally smaller and rounder than those found in the adjacent pulvinar nuclei, These results provide additional evidence for structural distinctions between thalamic nuclei having different functions, However, the observed differences are subtle, In addition, the data in this report provide morphological evidence that cortical signals are likely to be integrated by means of the circuitry located within the nucleus.

In this study, we examined the timing and occurrence of perisaccadic modulation of LGN single-unit activity in awake-behaving macaque monkeys while they made spontaneous saccades in the dark and made visually guided saccades to discrete stimuli located outside the receptive field. Our hypothesis was that the activity of LGN cells is modulated by efference copies of motor plans to produce saccadic eye movements and that this modulation depends neither on the presence of feedforward visual information nor on a corollary discharge of signals directing saccadic eye movements. On average, 25% of LGN cells demonstrated significant perisaccadic modulation. This modulation consisted of a moderate suppression of activity that began more than 100 ms prior to the initiation of a saccadic eye movement and continued beyond the termination of the saccadic eye movement. This suppression was followed by a large enhancement of activity after the eyes arrived at the next fixation. Although members of all three LGN relay cell classes (magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular) demonstrated significant saccade-related suppression and enhancement of activity, more cells demonstrated postsaccadic enhancement (25%) than perisaccadic suppression (17%). In no case did the timing of the modulation coincide directly with saccade duration. The degree of modulation observed did not vary with LGN cell class, LGN receptive field center location, center sign (ON-center or OFF-center), or saccade latency or velocity. The time course of modulation did, however, vary with saccade size such that suppression was longer for longer saccades. The fact that activity from a percentage of LGN cells from all cell classes was modulated in relationship to saccadic eye movements in the absence of direct visual stimulation suggests that this modulation is a general phenomenon not tied to specific types of visual stimuli. Similarly, because the onset of the modulation preceded eye movements by more than 100 ms, it is likely that this modulation reflects higher order motor-planning rather than a corollary of mechanisms in direct control of eye movements themselves. Finally, the fact that the largest modulation is a postsaccadic enhancement of activity may suggest that perisaccadic modulations are designed more for the facilitation of visual information processing once the eyes land at a new location than for filtering unwanted visual stimuli.;"Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Mol Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Med Ctr N,U3218, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Integrat & Cognit Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Res Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Univ Szeged, Dept Physiol, Szeged, Hungary";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Szeged University";Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.;vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY08890, EY01778, EY08126] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD15052] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [1F31NS44691] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;59;44;44;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

In 2 monkeys, injections were centered on the lateral VTA with some spread into the substantia nigra, while in one animal the injection targeted the medial VTA with partial spread into the ventro-medial thalamus. Double-labeling with antibodies against transduced fluorescent proteins (FPs) and tyrosine hydroxylase indicated that substantial portions of transduced midbrain neurons were dopaminergic. Interestingly, cortical terminals were found either homogeneously in molecular layer I, or more heterogeneously, sometimes forming patches, in the deeper laminae II-VI. In the animals with injections in lateral VTA, terminals were most dense in somatomotor cortex and the striatum. In contrast, when the medial VTA was transduced, dense terminals were found in dorsal prefrontal and temporal cortices, while projections to striatum were sparse. In all monkeys, orbitofrontal and occipito-parietal cortex received strong and weak innervation, respectively. Thus, the dopaminergic ventral midbrain sends heterogeneous projections throughout the brain. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of subgroups in meso-dopaminergic neurons depending on their location in the primate ventral midbrain.;"[Zubair, Muhammad; Murris, Sjoerd R.; Vanduffel, Wim] KU Leuven Med Sch, Dept Neurosci, Lab Neuro & Psychophysiol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Zubair, Muhammad; Murris, Sjoerd R.; Vanduffel, Wim] Leuven Brain Inst, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Zubair, Muhammad; Isa, Kaoru; Koshimizu, Yoshinori; Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Onoe, Hirotaka; Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Human Brain Res Ctr, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Kobayashi, Kenta] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Sect Viral Vector Dev, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Vanduffel, Wim] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Vanduffel, Wim] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02144 USA; [Isa, Tadashi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol WPI ASHBi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan";"KU Leuven; Kyoto University; Kyoto University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Kyoto University";"Isa, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Konoe Cho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;Vanduffel, W (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro & Psychophysiol, Campus Gasthuisberg,O&N 2,Herestr 49 Bus 1021, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.";"WVanduffel@mgh.harvard.edu; isa.tadashi.7u@kyoto-u.ac.jp";;"Zubair, Muhammad/0000-0003-2694-9364; Murris, Sjoerd/0000-0003-0300-3007";"Kyoto University; Japanese KAKENHI Grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [26112008, 19H05723, 19KK0192]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science International Bilateral Joint Research Program; Japan Agency of Science and Technology/Core Researches for Evolutionary Science and Technology [JPMJCR1651]; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development [20DM0107151, 20DM0307005]; Leuven [C14/17/109]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen (FWO-Flanders) [G0D5817N, G0B8617N, G0E0520N, VS02219N, G0007.12]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation [945539]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19H05723, 19KK0192, 26112008] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Kyoto University; Japanese KAKENHI Grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science International Bilateral Joint Research Program(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Agency of Science and Technology/Core Researches for Evolutionary Science and Technology; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development(Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)); Leuven(KU Leuven); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen (FWO-Flanders)(FWO); European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"This work was supported by Kyoto University; Japanese KAKENHI Grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (26112008, 19H05723 and 19KK0192), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science International Bilateral Joint Research Program, the Japan Agency of Science and Technology/Core Researches for Evolutionary Science and Technology (JPMJCR1651), the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (20DM0107151 and 20DM0307005); Leuven (C14/17/109); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen (FWO-Flanders) (G0D5817N, G0B8617N, G0E0520N, VS02219N; and Odysseus G0007.12); and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under Grant Agreement No 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA3).";;57;12;12;3;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

However, the relative extent of both representations is subject to considerable species variation. The present study employed microelectrode mapping and anatomical tracing to investigate the location and extent of the ipsilateral representation in area 3b of the somatosensory cortex of squirrel monkeys. A small region, approximately 2 mm(2), was found to be responsive to stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. This region was located on the anteromedial border of area 3b, surrounded by the representation of the contralateral roof of the mouth. This region corresponded to areas of intense anterograde labeling following injections placed in the ventromedial portion of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus at the only sites where neural responses could be elicited by stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. The amount of thalamus and cortex given over to the ipsilateral representation in the squirrel monkey is small compared with that of the macaque monkey. This difference may be related to the lack of cheek pouches in the squirrel monkey, and therefore a different strategy for eating. The representation of the contralateral lower lip in area 3b was split by the representation of the contralateral upper lip. This split representation is in agreement with previous studies of the trigeminal representation in area 3b of the macaque monkey and may be a general feature of the representation of the trigeminal nerve in area 3b of primate cerebral cortex.

Recently, we have demonstrated that JC virus can infect cerebellar granule cell neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons in immunosuppressed people. To examine whether SV40 neuronal infection occurs spontaneously in immunosuppressed macaques, we analyzed archival brain specimens from 20 simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus with AIDS and 1 cynomolgus post-transplant selected with SV40 brain infection from archival records from 1991 to 2012. In addition to white matter SV40 distribution in classic demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, some of the 21 monkeys exhibited meningeal, subpial neocortical, and periventricular virus. This distribution pattern corresponded to broader viral tropism with neuronal infection in 14 (66.7%) of 21 cases. In all 14 cases, identified neurons were positive for early SV40 transcript large T antigen, but only 4 of the 14 cases exhibited Late viral transcript viral protein 1-positive neurons. SV40-infected neurons were detected in frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and brain stem. These observations confirm that spontaneous 5V40 neuronal infection occurs in immunosuppressed macaques, which parallels JC virus-neuronal infection in immunosuppressed patients. Neuronal infection may be an important aspect of both SV40 and JC virus neuropathogenesis in their respective hosts.;"[Kaliyaperumal, Saravanan; Knight, Heather L.; Pearson, Christine; MacKey, John; Westmoreland, Susan V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Dept Comparat Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [Dang, Xin; Wuethrich, Christian; Koralnik, Igor J.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Div NeuroVirol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mansfield, Keith G.] Novartis, Cambridge, MA USA";"Harvard University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Novartis";Westmoreland, SV (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.;susan_westmoreland@hms.harvard.edu;;;"NIH [T32 OD011064]; New England Primate Research Center Base grant [P51OD011103-51]";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); New England Primate Research Center Base grant";Supported by NIH grant T32 OD011064 (S.V.W.) and New England Primate Research Center Base grant P51OD011103-51.;;27;15;16;0;4;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;0002-9440;1525-2191;;AM J PATHOL;Am.

In the present study, adult pig-tailed macaques were infected with a highly neuropathogenic virus SIVsmmFGb. MT imaging was exploited to examine the monkey brains before simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks post-SIV inoculation. Blood samples were collected from each animal for monitoring CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells before each MRI scan. The MT ratios (MTR) in several brain regions of interest were evaluated longitudinally. Significant reductions of MTR were observed in whole brain and selected regions of interest (genu, splenium, thalamus, caudate, centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, frontal gray matter, and putamen) in the SIV-infected monkeys, consistent with those reported previously in HIV patients. In particular, the longitudinal results indicate that abnormal MTR reduction can be detected as early as in 2 weeks and MTR may be more sensitive to the brain injury in cortical regions than in subcortical regions during acute SIV infection. In addition, MTR reduction in genu, centrum semiovale, and thalamus significantly correlated with the CD4(+) T cell percentage decrease. Also, the MTR reduction in thalamus correlated with the CD8(+) T cell percentage elevation. Taken together, this study reported the longitudinal evolution of MTR in different brain regions during SIV infection and further validates previous findings in HIV patients. The preliminary results suggest that MT imaging could be a robust and sensitive approach to characterize the neurodegeneration after SIV or HIV infection.;"[Li, Chun-Xia; Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Yerkes Imaging Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Herndon, James G.; Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neuropharmacol & Neurol Dis, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Novembre, Francis J.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Microbiol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Novembre, Francis J.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA";"Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University";Zhang, XD (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.;xzhang8@emory.edu;;;"National Center for Research Resources [P51RR000165]; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD [P51OD011132]; NIH [MH067769]";"National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University.

GnIH can also directly inhibit reproductive behaviors, possibly via action within the brain. Identification of the distribution of GnIH neurons and fibers may provide us with clues to how the brain controls reproductive activities of the animal. Here, we characterized the location and connectivity of GnIH neurons in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) brain. We determined the macaque GnIH precursor mRNA, and further identified a mature GnIH peptide (SGRNMEVSLVRQVLNLPQRF-NH(2)) by mass spectrometry combined with immunoaffinity purification. The majority of GnIH precursor mRNA-positive and GnIH-immunoreactive (GnIH-ir) cell bodies were localized in the intermediate periventricular nucleus (IPe) in the hypothalamus, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Abundant GnIH-ir fibers were observed in the nucleus of the stria terminalis in the telencephalon; habenular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, IPe, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, median eminence and dorsal hypothalamic area in the diencephalon; medial region of the superior colliculus, central gray substance of the midbrain and dorsal raphe nucleus in the midbrain; and parabrachial nucleus in the pons. GnIH-ir fibers were observed in close proximity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I, dopamine, beta-endorphin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II neurons in the preoptic area, We, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, and central gray substance of midbrain, respectively.

Thionin-stained sections in different planes showed that this is a subregion of lamina I containing clusters of neurons that appear to have pyramidal or polygonal somata. Extracellular microelectrode recordings in this region revealed clusters of thermoreceptive specific (COLD) cells with nasal or labial receptive fields, whereas nociceptive neurons were found in the adjacent portions of lamina I. Anterograde tracer injections in this region produced trigeminothalamic terminal labeling in the site homologous to the lamina I spino-thalamo-cortical relay nucleus identified previously in the Old World macaque monkey and in humans. Retrograde tracer injections involving this thalamic site, where recordings of trigeminal COLD-like neurons were obtained, produced clusters of retrogradely labeled trigeminothalamic neurons in this immunohistochemically distinct subregion of lamina I, nearly all of which are pyramidal neurons. We conclude that the nocturnal owl monkey has a specialized perinasal thermoreceptive trigeminothalamic sensory pathway that is probably of behavioral significance during olfactory sniffing. In addition, these observations corroborate other findings that have indicated that lamina I COLD cells are pyramidal neurons and are not physiologically modulated by substance P or serotonin, in contrast to nociceptive neurons.

To compare the expression of cholinesterases in the human thalamus, the distributions of BuChE and AChE activity were studied by using a modified Karnovsky-Roots method. BuChE activity was present mainly in neurons, whereas AChE activity was present in both neurons and axons. There was intense staining for BuChE or AChE throughout the thalamus, with some nuclei primarily expressing one or the other cholinesterase. BuChE staining was most intense and widespread in neurons in the anteroventral, mediodorsal, ventral, lateral, and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. AChE was predominantly expressed in neurons of the anterodorsal, midline, ventral, intralaminar, and reticular nuclei. Many nuclei contained both cholinesterases. Considering the overall patterns of labeling in the thalamus for the two cholinesterases, there were both complementary and overlapping relationships of BuChE and AChE activity. Neuronal staining in the subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamus was predominantly positive for AChE activity. The distinct distribution of BuChE activity in neurons in the human thalamus is consistent with an important role for this enzyme in neurotransmission in the human nervous system. Furthermore, BuChE activity, like AChE activity, is found in certain thalamic nuclei related to cognitive and behavioral functions. Involvement of thalamic nuclei in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia suggests that BuChE could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these disorders.

To do so, we examined labelling in the thalamus of eight macaque monkeys which received injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B-subunit within TE. Four of these cases were infants in which the injections revealed transient patterns of inputs to TE from various other brain regions. Although each monkey showed extensive label in the pulvinar nucleus and other subcortical structures, none showed unambiguous labelling in the dLGN. The absence of direct connections between the dLGN and area TE indicates that rudimentary color and form processing capacities in the absence of striate cortex must utilize other pathways even when damage to striate cortex takes place early in life.;"EMORY UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,ATLANTA,GA 30322; EMORY UNIV,YERKES REG PRIMATE RES CTR,ATLANTA,GA 30322";"Emory University; Emory University";;;;;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00165] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH-19420] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";;;21;4;4;0;0;ELSEVIER SCI IRELAND LTD;CLARE;CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER, BAY 15, SHANNON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE CO, CLARE, IRELAND;0304-3940;;;NEUROSCI LETT;Neurosci.

However, few studies have investigated the neural sites where multisensory integration may occur. Therefore, we used electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to study a region of the rat parietotemporal cortex that responds uniquely to auditory and somatosensory multisensory stimulation. This multisensory responsiveness suggests a functional organization resembling multisensory association cortex in cats and primates. Extracellular multielectrode surface mapping defined a region between auditory and somatosensory cortex where responses to combined auditory/somatosensory stimulation were larger in amplitude and earlier in latency than responses to either stimulus alone. Moreover, multisensory responses were nonlinear and differed from the summed unimodal responses. Intracellular recording found almost exclusively multisensory cells that responded to both unisensory and multisensory stimulation with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and/or action potentials, conclusively defining a multisensory zone (MZ). In addition, intracellular responses were similar to extracellular recordings, with larger and earlier EPSPs evoked by multisensory stimulation, and interactions suggesting nonlinear postsynaptic summation to combined stimuli. Thalamic input to MZ from unimodal auditory and somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei and from multisensory thalamic regions support the idea that parallel thalamocortical projections may drive multisensory functions as strongly as corticocortical projections. Whereas the MZ integrates uni- and multisensory thalamocortical afferent streams, it may ultimately influence brainstem multisensory structures such as the superior colliculus. J. Comp.

In this regard, all coordinates have been referenced to a line linking the anterior and posterior commissures (ac-pc line) and considering the center of the ac at the midline as the origin of the bicommissural space. The atlas comprises of 43 different plates (19 coronal levels, 10 sagittal levels and 14 horizontal levels). In addition to 'classical' cyto- and chemoarchitectural techniques such as the Nissl method and the acetylcholinesterase stain, several immunohistochemical stains have been performed in adjacent sections, including the detection of tyrosine hydroxylase, enkephalin, neurofilaments, parvalbumin and calbindin. In comparison to other existing stereotaxic atlases for M. fasicularis, this atlas has two main advantages: firstly, brain cartography is based on a wide variety of cyto- and chemoarchitectural stains carried out on adjacent sections, therefore enabling accurate segmentation. Secondly and most importantly, sagittal and horizontal planes are included. Sagittal planes are very useful for calculating oblique trajectories, whereas, clinical researchers engaged in neuroimaging studies will be more familiar with horizontal sections, as they use horizontal (also called axial) brain images in their daily routine of their clinical practices.;"[Lanciego, Jose L.] Univ Navarra, Area Neurociencias, CIMA, Fac Med, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Lanciego, Jose L.] Univ Navarra, Fac Med, Ctr Invest Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat CIBERN, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Vazquez, Alfonso] Complejo Hosp Navarra, Serv Neurocirugia, Pamplona, Spain";"University of Navarra; University of Navarra; Servicio Navarro de Salud - Osasunbidea";Lanciego, JL (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Area Neurociencias, CIMA, Fac Med, Pio XII Ave 55, Pamplona 31008, Spain.;jlanciego@unav.es;Lanciego, Jose L./G-7759-2015;Lanciego, Jose L./0000-0003-2301-5419;"Spanish Government (Ministerios de Salud y de Ciencia e Innovacion) [FIS 01/0237, BFI2003-02033, BFU2006-06744, BFU2009-08351, SAF2008-03118-E]; CiberNed [CB06/05/0006]; Government of Navarra (Departamento de Salud); UTE, Foundation for Applied Medical Research";"Spanish Government (Ministerios de Salud y de Ciencia e Innovacion); CiberNed(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Government of Navarra (Departamento de Salud); UTE, Foundation for Applied Medical Research";"Expert technical assistance was received at all times from our technicians Ms. Elvira Roda and Ms. Ainhoa Moreno.

Cortical origins of the corticospinal projections were examined by constructing planar projection maps of the distributions of labeled corticospinal neuron somas; these somas were found only in lamina V. At birth elaborate somatotopically organized corticospinal projections from primary motor cortex (area 4), the mesial supplementary motor area and cingulate areas 23 and 24, area 12, dorsolateral area 6a beta, the dorsolateral and ventral area 6a alpha (area F4), parietal areas 2/5, 7b and the peri-insular cortex (including area SII), were clearly defined, with axons extending to all spinal cord segments. While this pattern of regional projections broadly resembled that of the mature macaque, there were, however, substantial maturational changes during the 8 months after birth, These included (1) a halving of the area of cerebral cortex from which the contralateral corticospinal projection originated and (2) a threefold reduction in the number of labeled corticospinal neurons projecting to all segments of the cord. Collateral elimination rather than neuronal cell death was the likely mechanism for this reduction in the population and areal extent of corticospinal neurons in the maturing macaque. The surviving corticospinal axon terminals also developed substantially during the postnatal period, At birth some terminals had invaded the intermediate zone in each spinal segment, hut few had penetrated the dorsal and ventral horns. By 6 postnatal months, however, many corticospinal neurons were retrogradely labeled following the injection of fluorescent labels into each of these spinal zones in cervical and lumbar spinal segments. These data demonstrate a considerable postnatal reduction in corticospinal neurons projecting to the contralateral spinal cord, and imply that many of the axons that are eliminated never synapse on spinal neurons. It is suggested that during the middle fetal period the axons of many of the cortical neurons in lamina V that in the mature monkey will terminate on particular neuron populations in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord, traverse a common pathway down through the internal capsule into the spinal cord, passing close to these successive targets, and possibly forming collaterals at these levels. In the postnatal period each such neuron establishes a stable, effective synaptic input to only one or a few of these subcortical target populations, and the remaining collateral branches regress, The postnatal maturation of corticospinal neurons, examined in this study, is compatible with such a model.";UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, BRAIN RES LAB, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA;University of Melbourne;GALEA, MP (corresponding author), UNIV MELBOURNE, HOWARD FLOREY INST EXPTL PHYSIOL & MED, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA.;;Galea, Mary/F-4242-2010;Galea, Mary/0000-0003-0045-7978;;;;;78;74;74;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

The model clarifies how bottom-up and top-down processes work together to realize this goal, notably how processes of learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony are coordinated. The model hereby clarifies, for the first time, how the following levels of brain organization coexist to realize cognitive processing properties that regulate fast learning and stable memory of brain representations: single-cell properties, such as spiking dynamics, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and acetylcholine modulation; detailed laminar thalamic and cortical circuit designs and their interactions; aggregate cell recordings, such as current source densities and local field potentials; and single-cell and large-scale inter-areal oscillations in the gamma and beta frequency domains. In particular, the model predicts how laminar circuits of multiple cortical areas interact with primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific thalamic nuclei to carry out attentive visual learning and information processing. The model simulates how synchronization of neuronal spiking occurs within and across brain regions, and triggers STDP. Matches between bottom-up adaptively filtered input patterns and learned top-down expectations cause gamma oscillations that support attention, resonance, learning, and consciousness. Mismatches inhibit learning while causing beta oscillations during reset and hypothesis testing operations that are initiated in the deeper cortical layers. The generality of learned recognition codes is controlled by a vigilance process mediated by acetylcholine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The subcortical connections of MST and FST were found to be very similar. Both areas were found to be reciprocally connected with the pulvinar, mainly with its medial subdivision, and with the claustrum. Nonreciprocal projections from both MST and FST were consistently found in the striatum (caudate and putamen), reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the pontine nuclei. The labeled terminals in the pons were in the dorsolateral, lateral, dorsal, and peduncular nuclei. Additional nonreciprocal projections were found in one MST and one FST case to the nucleus of the optic tract, and, in one FST case, to the lateral terminal nucleus. Finally, three cases showed a nonreciprocal projection to FST from the basal forebrain. The subcortical structures containing label following MST and FST injections were largely the same as those labeled after injections of the middle temporal visual area (MT), but the label within each structure after MST and FST injections was more widespread than that from MT, overlapping the distribution of label that has been reported after injections of parietal visual areas.

This is in part because spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons that project to the posterior thalamus have received little attention. In this study, antidromic mapping was used to identify individual STT neurons with axons that projected specifically to the posterior thalamus in Macaca fascicularis. Each axon was located by antidromic activation at low stimulus amplitudes (<30 mu A) and was then surrounded distally by a grid of stimulating points in which 500-mu A stimuli were unable to activate the axon antidromically, thereby indicating the termination zone. Several nuclei within the posterior thalamus were targets of STT neurons: the posterior nucleus, suprageniculate nucleus, magnocellular part of the medial geniculate nucleus, and limitans nucleus. STT neurons projecting to the ventral posterior inferior nucleus were also studied. Twenty-five posterior thalamus-projecting STT neurons recorded in lumbar spinal cord were characterized by their responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Sixteen of 25 neurons were recorded in the marginal zone and the balance was located within the deep dorsal horn. Thirteen neurons were classified as wide dynamic range and 12 as high threshold. One-third of STT neurons projecting to posterior thalamus responded to noxious heat (50 degrees C). Two-thirds of those tested responded to cooling. Seventy-one percent responded to an intradermal injection of capsaicin. These data indicate that the primate STT transmits noxious and innocuous mechanical, thermal, and chemical information to multiple posterior thalamic nuclei.;"[Davidson, Steve; Zhang, Xijing; Giesler, Glenn J., Jr.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Khasabov, Sergey G.; Simone, Donald A.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Dent, Dept Diagnost & Biol Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Davidson, Steve; Simone, Donald A.; Giesler, Glenn J., Jr.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";Giesler, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, 6-145 Jackson Hall,321 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;giesler@umn.edu;;Davidson, Steve/0000-0003-2944-1144;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants [NS-047399, NS-059199]; Graduate School of the University of Minnesota";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Graduate School of the University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System)";This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants NS-047399 and NS-059199 and by the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota.;;92;14;14;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Focusing on a wiring diagram that spans the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus of the macaque brain, we identify robust modules in the network that provide a mesoscopic-level description of its topological architecture. Surprisingly, we find that the modular architecture facilitates rapid communication across the network, instead of localizing activity as is typically expected in networks having community organization. By considering processes of diffusive spreading and coordination, we demonstrate that the specific pattern of inter-and intramodular connectivity in the network allows propagation to be even faster than equivalent randomized networks with or without modular structure. This pattern of connectivity is seen at different scales and is conserved across principal cortical divisions, as well as subcortical structures. Furthermore, we find that the physical proximity between areas is insufficient to explain the modular organization, as similar mesoscopic structures can be obtained even after factoring out the effect of distance constraints on the connectivity. By supplementing the topological information about the macaque connectome with physical locations, volumes, and functions of the constituent areas and analyzing this augmented dataset, we reveal a counterintuitive role played by the modular architecture of the brain in promoting global coordination of its activity. It suggests a possible explanation for the ubiquity of modularity in brain networks.;"[Pathak, Anand; Menon, Shakti N.; Sinha, Sitabhra] CIT Campus, Inst Math Sci, Chennai 600113, India; [Pathak, Anand; Sinha, Sitabhra] Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Mumbai 400094, India";"Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) India; Homi Bhabha National Institute";"Pathak, A (corresponding author), CIT Campus, Inst Math Sci, Chennai 600113, India.;Pathak, A (corresponding author), Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Mumbai 400094, India.";;Menon, Shakti/HOH-8797-2023;;"Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India; DST";"Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India))";S.N.M. has been supported by the IMSc Complex Systems Project (12th Plan) , and the Center of Excellence in Complex Systems and Data Science, both funded by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.

Acting on this vital relay is another thalamic nucleus, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). This nucleus receives topographically organized collaterals from both thalamus and cortex and sends similarly organized projections back to thalamus. The inputs to the TRN are excitatory, but the output back to the thalamic relay is inhibitory, providing an ideal organization for modulating visual activity during early processing. This functional architecture led Crick in 1984 to hypothesize that TRN serves to direct a searchlight of attention to different regions of the topographic map; however, despite the substantial influence of this hypothesis, the activity of TRN neurons has never been determined during an attention task. We have determined the nature of the response of visual TRN neurons in awake monkeys, and the modulation of that response as the monkeys shifted attention between visual and auditory stimuli. Visual TRN neurons had a strong (194 spikes/s) and fast (25 ms latency) transient increase of activity to spots of light falling in their receptive fields, as well as high background firing rate (45 spikes/s). When attention shifted to the spots of light, the amplitude of the transient visual response typically increased, whereas other neuronal response characteristics remained unchanged. Thus, as predicted previously, TRN activity is modified by shifts of visual attention, and these attentional changes could influence visual processing in LGN via the inhibitory connections back to the thalamus.";NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20982 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";McAlonan, K (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 2A50,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20982 USA.;km@nei.nih.gov;;;Intramural NIH HHS Funding Source: Medline;Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);;;32;159;161;0;9;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure-ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.;"[Self, Matthew W.; Kooijmans, Roxana N.; Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Netherlands Inst Neurosci KNAW, Dept Vis & Cognit, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Super, Hans] Univ Barcelona, Fac Psicol, ICREA, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Super, Hans] Univ Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Basica, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Lamme, Victor A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurogen & Cognit Res, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands";"Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN-KNAW); ICREA; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam";Self, MW (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Neurosci KNAW, Dept Vis & Cognit, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands.;m.self@nin.knaw.nl;Roelfsema, Pieter/J-6903-2013;"Roelfsema, Pieter/0000-0002-1625-0034; Super, Hans/0000-0001-9328-0096; Self, Matthew/0000-0001-5731-579X";"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)-VICI grant; European Union (EU): Information Society Technologies (IST) Cognitive Systems [027198]; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); NWO-VIDI grant; European Research Council; ICREA Funding Source: Custom";"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)-VICI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Union (EU): Information Society Technologies (IST) Cognitive Systems; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)(Human Frontier Science Program); NWO-VIDI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ICREA(ICREA)";We thank Kor Brandsma for help with surgical procedures and animal training and Istvan Ulbert for technical help with the injectrodes.

One hundred 5-HT immunoreactive terminals from the cat and approximately forty 5-HT and TH immunoreactive terminals from the monkey were selected for analysis in serial thin sections. Only 7-10% of the immunoreactive terminals could be revealed to form conventional synaptic contacts. Most of these could be identified as the asymmetrical type. Dendritic shafts belonging to relay neurons were the major targets of these monoamine immunoreactive terminals. The remainder made intimate membrane associations with relay cell dendrites and somata or with presynaptic dendrites of interneurons, but no overt membrane specializations could be detected. The present results suggest that the modulation of thalamocortical relay function by brainstem monoamine pathways in the somatosensory thalamus may occur by release of transmitters at atypical contact sites.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS22317] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;39;22;22;0;0;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Focal iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer, biocytin, were made into the vMGB of neonatal rabbits to examine the morphological organization of auditory thalamocortical (TC) afferents prior to hearing onset. TC afferents terminated in distinct patches as early as postnatal day 1 (PD-0 = day of birth), 6 days before the behavioral onset of hearing. In contrast to TC afferents in adults, the terminal arbors of neonatal vMGB axons occupied the entire depth of the cortical plate and lamina I. Serial section reconstructions revealed that single vMGB axons in neonates branched to form multiple patches within the cortical plate. Collaterals also extended to lamina I where they coursed tangentially for several millimeters. An unusual feature of the neonatal TC patches was the contribution of descending collaterals from axons coursing in lamina I. The presence of distinct patches prior to hearing onset indicates that the segregation of auditory TC axons occurs in the absence of acoustically driven activity.

Accordingly, we used in vitro slices from which to record and labeled cells in the middle layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices to compare basic anatomical and physiological features of cells recovered in similar layers using the same methods. Our results demonstrate a striking difference in a basic characteristic of two primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual cortex, spiny stellate cells predominate, receive short-latency synaptic inputs, and project to supergranular layers. No such spiny stellate population is encountered in the middle layers of the auditory cortex. Spiny cells that are not stellate or pyramidal are occasionally encountered but, as a group, do not display consistent anatomical or physiological features that might allow them to function as auditory cortical versions of the visual spiny stellates. Rather, pyramidal cells in the lower half of layer 3 and layer 4 appear to have assumed this role. J. Comp. Neurol. 436:508-519, 2001.

SIV infected model for detecting the neurological changes with progression was studied. Methods: In the study, six rhesus macaques infected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were scanned by resting-state fMRI at the following time points: before SIV inoculation (baseline), 12 weeks and 24 weeks post inoculation (12 wpi, 24 wpi). Meanwhile, the immunological parameters including serum percentage of CD4+ T cell, CD4/CD8 ratio and absolute CD4+ T cell number were measured and analyzed. Results: In comparison of baseline, significant decreased ReHo was found in the left superior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, right precuneus, left angular gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus; in contrast increased ReHo in putamen at 12 wpi. Moreover, at the time of 24 wpi, decreased ReHo was observed in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulated gyrus and thalamus, while ReHo was increased in the left putamen, hippocampus, left anterior cingulated cortex and precentral cortex. The correlation analysis revealed that ReHo in the superior frontal gyrus showed negative association with CD4/CD8 ratio and positive with absolute CD4+ T cell number. The correlation analysis showed that percentage of CD4+ was correlated with the ReHo values in right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral thalamus and amygdala positively; negative relationship with left putamen, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior and middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The study first indicates that hippocampus, putamen, frontal and occipital lobe were impaired by using rs-fMRI and correlated with immunological parameters. Thus, ReHo value can be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of spontaneous brain activity changes caused by the progression of neurological impairments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Its therapeutic effect may depend on its ability to enter the brain and bind to the oxytocin receptor. To date, the brain tissue penetrance of intranasal oxytocin has not been demonstrated. In this nonhuman primate study, we administer deuterated oxytocin intranasally and intravenously to rhesus macaques and measure, with mass spectrometry, concentrations of labeled (exogenously administered) and endogenous oxytocin in 12 brain regions two hours after oxytocin administration. Labeled oxytocin is quantified after intranasal (not intravenous) administration in brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, brainstem, and thalamus) that lie in the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. These results suggest that intranasal administration bypasses the blood-brain barrier, delivering oxytocin to specific brain regions, such as the striatum, where oxytocin acts to impact motivated behaviors. Further, high concentrations of endogenous oxytocin are in regions that overlap with projection fields of oxytocinergic neurons. The location and extent of intranasal oxytocin brain penetrance has not been shown. Here the authors show that oxytocin, administered intranasally, enters brain regions along the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and there, reaches biologically relevant concentrations.;"[Lee, M.

Using [C-11](R)PKI1195, a sensitive in vivo marker of glial cell activation, and PET, we provide first evidence that limb denervation induces a trans-synaptic increase in [C-11](R)-PKI1195 binding in the human thalamus but not somatosensory cortex: these brain structures appeared morphologically normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity. Our findings support the view that long-term rearrangement of cortical representational maps is significantly determined within the thalamus.

Much is known about the adaptive effects of constant stimulation over prolonged periods. However, there are open questions regarding adaptation to stimuli that are changing over time, interrupted, or repeated. Feature-specific adaptation to repeating stimuli has been shown to occur as early as primary visual cortex (V1), but there is also evidence for more generalized, fatigue-like adaptation that might occur at an earlier stage of processing. Here, we show adaptation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake, fixating monkeys following brief (1 s) exposure to repeated cycles of a 4-Hz drifting grating. We examined the relative change of each neuron's response across successive (repeated) grating cycles. We found that neurons from all cell classes (parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular) showed significant adaptation. However, only magnocellular neurons showed adaptation when responses were averaged to a population response. In contrast to firing rates, response variability was largely unaffected. Finally, adaptation was comparable between monocular and binocular stimulation, suggesting that rapid LGN adaptation is monocular in nature. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural adaptation can be defined as reduction of spiking responses following repeated or prolonged stimulation. Adaptation helps adjust neural responsiveness to avoid saturation and has been suggested to improve perceptual selectivity, information transmission, and predictive coding. Here, we report rapid adaptation to repeated cycles of gratings drifting over the receptive field of neurons at the earliest site of postretinal processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.;"[Daumail, Loic; Carlson, Brock M.; Mitchell, Blake A.; Westerberg, Jacob A.; Tong, Frank; Maier, Alexander] Vanderbilt Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cox, Michele A.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY USA; [Westerberg, Jacob A.] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Dept Vis & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Johnson, Cortez] Kaiser Permanente Bernard J Tyson Sch Med Pasadena, Pasadena, CA USA; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Integrat Bra, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dougherty, Kacie] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ USA";"Vanderbilt University; University of Rochester; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN-KNAW); University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Princeton University";Maier, A (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;alex.maier@vanderbilt.edu;"Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009; Maier, Alexander/B-7489-2009; Westerberg, Jacob/Q-5989-2016";"Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Maier, Alexander/0000-0002-7250-502X; Dougherty, Kacie/0000-0001-6295-0026; Daumail, Loic/0000-0002-1887-2574; Carlson, Brock/0000-0003-4846-099X; Mitchell, Blake/0000-0001-7321-2854; Westerberg, Jacob/0000-0001-5331-8707";"National Eye Institute (NEI) [1R01EY027402-03, R01EY029278]; Vision Research Center core Grant from the NEI; Whitehall Foundation; Knights Templar Eye Foundation; National Eye Institute [T32EY007135]; Vision Research Center training Grant;  [F31EY031293];  [P30EY008126]";"National Eye Institute (NEI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Vision Research Center core Grant from the NEI; Whitehall Foundation; Knights Templar Eye Foundation; National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Vision Research Center training Grant; ; ";This work is supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI) research project Grants 1R01EY027402-03 and R01EY029278, a Vision Research Center core Grant P30EY008126 from the NEI, a Vision Research Center training Grant T32EY007135, a research grant from the Whitehall Foundation, a career starter grant from the Knights Templar Eye Foundation.

The MITN that project to cingulate cortex have a prominent innervation by norepinephrinergic axons primarily originating from the LC. The hypothesis explored in this study is that MITN neurons that project to cingulate cortex receive a disproportionately high LC input that may modulate nociceptive afferent flow into the forebrain. Ten cynomolgus monkeys were evaluated for dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DBH) immunohistochemistry, and nuclei with moderate or high DBH activity were analyzed for intermediate neurofilament proteins, calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR). Sections of all but DBH were thionin counterstained to assure precise localization in the mediodorsal and MITN, and cytoarchitecture was analyzed with neuron-specific nuclear binding protein. Moderate high levels of DBH-immunoreactive (ir) axons were generally associated with high densities of CB-ir and CR-ir neurons and low levels of neurofilament proteins. The paraventricular, superior centrolateral, limitans and central nuclei had relatively high and evenly distributed DBH, the magnocellular mediodorsal and paracentral nuclei had moderate DBH-ir, and other nuclei had an even and low level of activity. Some nuclei also have heterogeneities in DBH-ir that raised questions of functional segregation. The anterior multiformis part of the mediodorsal nucleus but not middle and caudal levels had high DBH activity. The posterior parafascicular nucleus (Pf) was heterogeneous with the lateral part having little DBH activity, while its medial division had most DBH-ir axons and its multiformis part had only a small number. These findings suggest that the LC may regulate nociceptive processing in the thalamus. The well established role of cingulate cortex in premotor functions and the projections of Pf and other MITN to the limbic striatum suggests a specific role in mediating motor outflow for the LC-innervated nuclei of the MITN.;"[Vogt, Brent A.; Vogt, Leslie J.] Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, Manlius, NY USA; [Vogt, Brent A.; Vogt, Leslie J.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Manlius, NY USA; [Hof, Patrick R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Friedman, David P.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Sikes, Robert W.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Wake Forest University; Northeastern University";Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, 4435 Stephanie Dr, Manlius, NY USA.;bvogt@twcny.rr.com;"Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015; Friedman, David P/G-7842-2011";"Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410; Friedman, David P/0000-0003-1732-2404";"NIH-NINDS [RO1-NS44222]; James S.

Anterograde labeling of terminals was done with 2% WGA-HRP injections in the cervical enlargement; thalamocortical cells were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent tracers. In one experiment, the contralateral;primary somatosensory cortex hand region (hSI) was injected to provide a direct comparison with hSII thalamic label. Both labeled cells and terminal-like structures were visualized in single thalamic sections and their numbers and positions quantitatively analyzed. The number of labeled cells within 100 microns from the STT terminals were counted as overlapping cells. Four thalamic nuclei, ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior lateral (VPI), posterior nucleus (PO) and centrolateral nucleus (CL) combined to contain 86.5% of all hSII-projecting overlapping cells. Of all hSII-projecting thalamic overlapping cells, VPI contained the largest number (36.4% of the total)followed by the anterior portion of the posterior nuclear complex (POa; 20.4%), VPL (18.3%) and CL (11.4%). Results of the hSI injection show a different pattern of overlap in agreement with our earlier study. The relative distribution of overlapping cells was dependent on the antero-posterior position of the SII injections. The most anterior injections resulted in small numbers of labeled cells, with the majority of overlapping cells located in PO and CL. The more posterior injections resulted in overlapping cells mainly in VPI and VPL.

Ten healthy human volunteers underwent brain scan examinations by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two optic flow experiments. In addition to the classical LGN-V1-hMT + pathway, our results showed a significant direct influence of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded in LGN over that in hMT +, not mediated by V1 activity, which strongly supports the existence of a bilateral pathway that connects LGN directly to hMT + and serves visual motion processing. Furthermore, we evaluated the relative latencies among areas functionally connected in the processing of visual motion. Using LGN as a reference region, hMT + exhibited a statistically significant earlier peak of activation as compared to V1. In conclusion, our findings suggest the co-existence of an alternative route that directly links LGN to hMT +, bypassing V1. This direct pathway may play a significant functional role for the faster detection of motion and may contribute to explain persistence of unconscious motion detection in individuals with severe destruction of primary visual cortex (blindsight).

We have developed pain models for cynomolgus macaques because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the cynomolgus macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaques are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. The purpose of this study is to elucidate pain-related brain activation regions in the macaque models using fMRI. Generally, pain testing in animal models has been based on avoidance behavior against pain stimuli. However, we identified pain-related brain activation regions using fMRI under propofol anesthesia as a more objective evaluation method. In the macaque model of chymopapain-induced discogenic low back pain, the activity of the insular cortex occurred in response to lumbar compression stimulation. In the macaque model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, activation of the insular cortex also occurred in response to cold stimuli. As a result of evaluating pregabalin, duloxetine and tramadol, only duloxetine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the macaque model of postoperative pain, activation of the insula cortex was mainly activated by pressure stimulation. As a result of evaluating morphine, pregabalin and diclofenac, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to postoperative pain. However, macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis exhibited a pain response against pressure stimuli to the abdomen, and had activation of the thalamus. As a result of evaluating morphine, meloxicam and acetaminophen, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of thalamus due to abdominal pain from endometriosis. It was suggested that the brain activation regions could change due to various conditions that can cause the pain, as the acute pain increased activation in the insula cortex and the chronic pain increased activation in the thalamus. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fMRI as a pain biomarker, and fMRI analysis using the macaques might provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. Therefore, these study will contribute to the development of new analgesics for each pain as well as to the progress in the areas of brain research.;"[Ushirozako, Hiroki; Yoshida, Go; Hasegawa, Tomohiko; Yamato, Yu; Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, 1-20-1 Handayama, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4313192, Japan; [Yamato, Yu] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Div Geriatr Musculoskeletal Hlth, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Natsume, Takahiro; Ogawa, Shinya; Awaga, Yuji; Hama, Aldric; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki] Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Pharmacol Grp, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan";"Hamamatsu University School of Medicine; Hamamatsu University School of Medicine";Ushirozako, H (corresponding author), Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, 1-20-1 Handayama, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4313192, Japan.;;Ushirozako, Hiroki/AAH-5949-2019;;;;;;15;0;0;0;3;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN;TOKYO;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN, TOKYO, 00000, JAPAN;0915-8588;2187-4697;;PAIN RES;Pain Res.;;2020;35;1;;;;;45;51;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.11154/pain.35.45;;;7;Clinical Neurology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Neurosciences & Neurology;NG1AR;;gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000563720600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using three-dimensional reconstructions of electron microscopic images, we quantitatively characterize a GABAergic pathway that establishes synaptic contacts exclusively via multiple synapses. Axon terminals of the nigrothalamic pathway formed, on average, 8.5 synapses on large-diameter dendrites and somata of relay cells in the ventromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. All synapses of a given terminal converged on a single postsynaptic element. The vast majority of the synapses established by a single terminal were not separated by astrocytic processes. Nigrothalamic terminals in the macaque monkey showed the same ultrastructural features both in qualitative and quantitative terms (the median number of synapse per target was also 8.5). The individual synapses were closely spaced in both species. The nearest-neighbor synaptic distances were 169 nm in the rat and 178 nm in the monkey. The average number of synapses within 0.75 mu m from any given synapse was 3.8 in the rat and 3.5 in the monkey. The arrangement of synapses described in this study creates favorable conditions for intersynaptic spillover of GABA among the multiple synapses of a single bouton, which can result in larger charge transfer. This could explain faithful and efficient GABAergic signal transmission in the nigrothalamic pathway in the healthy condition and during Parkinson's disease. In addition, our structural data suggest that the rodent nigrothalamic pathway can be a valid model of the primate condition, when the mechanism of GABAergic transmission is studied.;"[Bodor, Agnes L.; Giber, Kristof; Rovo, Zita; Acsady, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Dept Cellular & Network Neurobiol, H-1450 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Physiol, H-1068 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Dept Informat Technol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary";"Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Institute of Experimental Medicine; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University";Acsady, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Szigony U 43, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.;acsady@koki.hu;"Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010; Acsady, Laszlo/C-7773-2014";Acsady, Laszlo/0000-0002-0679-2980;Wellcome Trust [067573] Funding Source: Medline;Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);;;65;51;51;0;7;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

V2 contains three sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions) and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well; terminal label in layers 3-4 was distributed in discrete patches with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and targeted both ''thick'' (Cat-301(+)) and ''thin'' GO-rich stripes, avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers 5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer 6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent thalamic input shared by the ''thick'' and ''thin'' CO stripes (which receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests another potential source of integration between the two cortical visual streams.";JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,KRIEGER MIND BRAIN INST,BALTIMORE,MD 21218;Johns Hopkins University;LEVITT, JB (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON,INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT VISUAL SCI,11-43 BATH ST,LONDON WC1V 9EL,ENGLAND.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY05282, EY08098, EY10021] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;43;58;58;0;2;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Connections in the mediolateral direction from core, to belt, to parabelt, have been well described, but less is known about the flow of information along the supratemporal plane (STP) in the caudorostral dimension. Neuroanatomical tracers were injected throughout the caudorostral extent of the auditory core and rostral STP by direct visualization of the cortical surface. Auditory cortical areas were distinguished by SMI-32 immunostaining for neurofilament, in addition to established cytoarchitectonic criteria. The results describe a pathway comprising step-wise projections from AI through the rostral and rostrotemporal fields of the core (R and RT), continuing to the recently identified rostrotemporal polar field (RTp) and the dorsal temporal pole. Each area was strongly and reciprocally connected with the areas immediately caudal and rostral to it, though deviations from strictly serial connectivity were observed. In RTp, inputs converged from core, belt, parabelt, and the auditory thalamus, as well as higher order cortical regions.

Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem, These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.;"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;s.sherman@sunysb.edu;;;;;;;97;583;594;2;46;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;1471-2970;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

In order to determine whether the DA innervation of the primate MD shares the anatomical features of the mesocortical or nigrostriatal DA projections, we performed tract-tracing and immunocytochemistry studies in macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to identify the location of the DA neurons that project to MD and immuno-electron microscopy to determine the distribution of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in axons within the MD. Similar to the mesocortical projection, retrogradely-labeled, tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons were present in dorsal tier ventral mesencephalic nuclei, such as the ventral tegmental area and the dorsal portion of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, no dual-labeled neurons were present in the ventral tier nuclei, the primary origin of the nigrostriatal DA pathway. In addition, like the DA projection to the prefrontal cortex, DAT immunoreactivity was predominantly localized to the pre-terminal portion of axons in the MD, and was infrequently found in association with synaptic vesicles, in contrast to nigrostriatal DA axons. These findings indicate that the DA projection to the MD shares anatomical features with the mesocortical DA system, suggesting that the functional properties of DA neurotransmission in the MD might be more similar to those in the cortex than in the striatum.

Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered similar to 500 mu m deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.;"[Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Maier, Alexander; Aura, Christopher J.; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 49 Convent Dr,1E21,MSC 4400, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;leopoldd@mail.nih.gov;Maier, Alexander/B-7489-2009;"Maier, Alexander/0000-0002-7250-502X; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360";"National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Eye Institute";"National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))";This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Eye Institute.

We provide histological descriptions of the major sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the superior colliculus (SC) of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus has the six layers typical of strepsirrhine primates, with matching pairs of magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers, one of each pair for each eye. Unlike most primates, magnocellular and parvocellular layers exhibit only small differences in cell size. All layers express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), reflecting terminations of retinal inputs, and the expression of VGLUT2 is much less dense in the koniocellular layers. Parvalbumin is densely expressed in all layers, while SMI-32 is densely expressed only in the magnocellular layers. The adjoining pulvinar complex has a posterior nucleus with strong VGLUT2 expression, reflecting terminations from the SC. The SC is laminated with dense expression of VGLUT2 in the upper superficial gray layer, reflecting terminations from the retina. The ventral (MGNv), medial, and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate complex are only moderately differentiated, although patches of dense VGLUT2 expression are found along the outer border of MGNv. The ventroposterior nucleus has darkly stained cells in Nissl stained sections, and narrow septa separating patchy regions of dense VGLUT2 expression that likely represent different body parts.

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus in combination with a conventional tracer, we studied direct and polysynaptic inputs to the ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) and medial intraparietal area (MIP) in non-human primates, to identify possible sources of eye position and gaze signals. We found that these areas receive disynaptic inputs from the brainstem horizontal eye position integrator network (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, PH) via the central lateral and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei. Our findings provide the first demonstration that inputs from the horizontal eye position integrator reach cortical areas. We found important topographical differences between PH populations targeting MIP and LIPv that likely reflect transmission of different types of eye movement signals. LIPv receives projections from the ipsilateral rostral PH, which may transmit ipsilateral eye position signals. In addition to inputs from the rostral PH, MIP receives strong projections from the contralateral caudal PH, which may contribute to both eye position and velocity signals. Unlike the horizontal integrator, we found that the vertical eye position integrator network, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, does not project to these posterior parietal areas, in keeping with findings that the thalamic nuclei targeting LIPv and MIP receive almost exclusively horizontal oculomotor signals.;"[Prevosto, Vincent; Ugolini, Gabriella] CNRS, Neurobiol Cellulaire & Mol Lab, UPR9040, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Graf, Werner] Howard Univ, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington, DC 20059 USA";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Howard University";Ugolini, G (corresponding author), CNRS, Neurobiol Cellulaire & Mol Lab, UPR9040, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;gabriella.ugolini@nbcm.cnrs-gif.fr;;Prevosto, Vincent/0000-0001-8803-5918;"European Union [QLRT-2001-00151]; french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres";"European Union(Spanish Government); french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres";This work was supported by the European Union grant EU 5th FP (QLRT-2001-00151, EUROKINESIS) and the Lavoisier Fellowship from the french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres (V.P.).

Given the importance of the marginal zone in nociception, this conclusion has raised doubts about the significance of the role of the ventrobasal complex in nociception. We have reexamined this projection using injections of the retrograde tracer, cholera toxin subunit B, into one side of the lateral thalamus in macaque monkeys. The injections were confined to the ventrobasal complex (with minimal spread to adjacent nuclei that do not receive spinal projections) in two animals. Many retrogradely labeled neurons were found in lamina I (as well as in lamina V) of the contralateral spinal and medullary dorsal hem. The results an consistent with the view that neurons in the marginal zone contribute prominently to the spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic projections to the VPL and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei. This pathway is likely to be important for the sensory-discriminative processing of nociceptive information with respect to the location and intensity of painful stimuli.

Injections that filled all of VLpv labeled abundant neurons that were inhomogeneously distributed among many unlabeled cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN). Single large pressure injections made in face-, forelimb-, or hindlimb-related portions of VLpv using physiological guidance labeled numerous neurons that were broadly dispersed within a coarse somatotopographic anteroposterior (foot to face) gradient in the dentate and interposed nuclei. Small iontophoretic injections labeled fewer neurons with the same somatotopographic gradient, but strikingly, the labeled neurons in these cases were as broadly dispersed as in cases with large injections. Simultaneous injections of multiple tracers in VLpv (one tracer per somatic region with no overlap between injections) confirmed the general somatotopography but also demonstrated clearly the overlapping distributions and the close intermingling of neurons labeled with different tracers. Significantly, very few neurons (<2%) were double-labeled. This organizational pattern contrasts with the concept of a segregated point-to-point somatotopy and instead resembles the complex patterns that have been observed throughout the motor pathway. These data support the idea that muscle synergies are represented anatomically in the DCbN by a general somatotopography in which intermingled neurons and dispersed but selective connections provide the basis for plastic, adaptable movement coordination of different parts of the body.;"[Evrard, Henry C.; (Bud) Craig, A.

In this way, prosimian primates, close relatives of simian primates, and tree shrews differ markedly from monkeys in which S-II is deactivated by comparable ablations, and resemble such mammals as cats and rabbits in which S-II also remains highly responsive following ablations in S-I. Thus, it appears that the generalized mammalian condition is that S-I and S-II are independently activated via parallel thalamocortical pathways.

In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a 'fast lane' reserved to highspeed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.

Nissl, acetylcholinesterase, cytochrome oxidase, myelin, parvalbumin, calbindin, and Cat 301 preparations allowed the ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamic regions, parvocellular and magnocellular subdivisions of ventral anterior nucleus, and anterior and posterior subdivisions of ventral lateral nucleus of monkeys to be identified. The results indicate that each cortical area receives inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the proportions differ. Ill receives major inputs from the posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus while premotor areas receive major inputs from anterior parts of ventral lateral nucleus (the anterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus and the anterior portion of posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus). PMD and SMA have connections with more dorsal parts of the ventral lateral nucleus than PMV. The results suggest that galagos share many subdivisions of the motor thalamus and thalamocortical connection patterns with simian primates, while having less clearly differentiated subdivisions of the motor thalamus.

Much of our understanding of the physiology of LGN neurons comes from data collected in anaesthetized animals. This study examines the visual responses of LGN neurons in alert animals and compares these responses to those from anaesthetized animals. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, LGN neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with stronger responses and follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies. Stronger responses are likely to translate into an increased coupling between the LGN and visual cortex, as firing rate and interspike interval are known to influence the dynamics of synaptic communication between the two structures. Abstract Despite the increasing use of alert animals for studies aimed at understanding visual processing in the cerebral cortex, relatively little attention has been focused on quantifying the response properties of neurons that provide input to the cortex. Here, we examine the response properties of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in the alert macaque monkey and compare these responses to those in the anaesthetized animal. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre-surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.";"[Alitto, Henry J.; Moore, Bartlett D.; Rathbun, Daniel L.; Usrey, W.

Previous studies showed that corticothalamic input is essential for the development of thalamocortical projections, but less is known about the potential role of this reciprocal connection in the development of retinal projections. Here, we show a deficit of retinal innervation in the dLGN around E18.5 in Tra2 beta conditional knockout (cKO) cortexless mice, an age when apoptosis occurs along the thalamocortical tract and in some dLGN neurons. In vivo electrophysiology experiments in the dLGN further confirmed the loss of functional retinal input. Experiments with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced V1 lesion as well as Fezf2 cKO mice confirmed that the disruption of connections between the dLGN and V1 lead to abnormal retinal projections to the dLGN. Interestingly, retinal projections to the ventral Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (vLGN) and Superior Colliculus (SC) were normal in all 3 mice models. Finally, we show that the cortexless mice had worse performance than control mice in a go-no go task with visual cues. Our results provide evidence that the wiring of visual circuit from the retina to the dLGN and V1 thereafter is coordinated at a surprisingly early stage of circuit development.;"[Diao, Yupu; Cui, Liyuan; Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Jiayi] Fudan Univ, Inst Brain Sci, State Key Lab Med Neurobiol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Diao, Yupu; Cui, Liyuan; Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Jiayi] Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Brain Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Burbridge, Timothy J.; Han, Wenqi; Sestan, Nenad; Crair, Michael C.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Wirth, Brunhilde] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne, Inst Genet, Inst Human Genet, D-55322 Cologne, Germany";"Fudan University; Fudan University; Yale University; University of Cologne";Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Med, Rm 1006,Mingdao Bldg,131 Dongan Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;jiayizhang@fudan.edu.cn;;"Wirth, Brunhilde/0000-0003-4051-5191; Zhang, Jiayi/0000-0002-1575-0723";"National Science Foundation of China [31271158, 31421091, 31422025]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal [13PJ1401000]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2015AA020512]; National Institutes of Health [MH105972, MH103339, EY023105, EY015788]; Young 1000 Plan";"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Young 1000 Plan";"National Science Foundation of China (31271158, 31421091, and 31422025 to J.Z.); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal (13PJ1401000 to J.Z.); the Young 1000 Plan and Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2015AA020512 to J.Z.); National Institutes of Health (grants MH105972, MH103339 to N.S. and grants EY023105, EY015788 to M.C.).";;45;12;12;3;20;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Nevertheless, the role of corticothalamic circuits in sensory processing remains a mystery. In the visual system, afferents from retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from LGN to primary visual cortex (V1) are organized into functionally distinct parallel processing streams. Physiological evidence suggests corticogeniculate feedback may be organized into parallel streams; however, little is known about the diversity of corticogeniculate neurons, their local computations, or the structure-function relationship among corticogeniculate neurons. We used a virus-mediated approach to label and reconstruct the complete dendritic and local axonal arbors of identified corticogeniculate neurons in the macaque monkey. Our results reveal morphological substrates for parallel streams of corticogeniculate feedback based on distinct classes of neurons in V1 and V2.

In the present study, somatotopical representations of the PMdr were electrophysiologically identified in the macaque monkey, and the distribution of corticostriatal input from the forelimb region of the PMdr was analyzed in relation to its thalamocortical and intracortical (with the frontal lobe) connections. Results have revealed that (1) the forelimb is represented predominantly in the PMdr, while only a few sites representing other body parts are distributed as embedded within the forelimb representation; (2) the corticostriatal input zone is located in the striatal cell bridges and their surroundings; (3) the cells of origin of the thalamocortical projections to the PMdr are located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus, the oral divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, area X, the caudal divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the intralaminar nuclear group; (4) the PMdr is interconnected primarily with higher-order motor-related areas and dorsal area 46.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig, 2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function.

Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011) showed that distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was coregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The 3D dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.;"[Ilinsky, Igor; Gressens, Pierre; Verney, Catherine; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Hop Robert Debre, INSERM, U1141, UMRS 1141, Paris, France; [Ilinsky, Igor; Gressens, Pierre; Verney, Catherine; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Horn, Andreas] Charite, Movement Disorders & Neuromodulat Unit, D-10967 Berlin, Germany; [Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine] CNRS, PICT IBISA Inst Curie, Unite Mixte Rech 144, F-75005 Paris, France; [Ilinsky, Igor; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; UNICANCER; Institut Curie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Iowa";"Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Hop Robert Debre, INSERM, U1141, UMRS 1141, Paris, France.;Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.;Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.";igorkristy@gmail.com;"Horn, Andreas/R-6528-2017; gressens, pierre/M-7557-2017; Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine/L-8287-2018";"Horn, Andreas/0000-0002-0695-6025; gressens, pierre/0000-0002-0909-4221; Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine/0000-0002-4822-165X";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Universite Paris Diderot; Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol; PremUp Fondation; Berlin Institute of Health";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)); Universite Paris Diderot; Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol; PremUp Fondation; Berlin Institute of Health";This work was supported by Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Universite Paris Diderot, Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol, and PremUp Fondation, and Berlin Institute of Health.;;55;40;40;0;1;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;;2373-2822;;ENEURO;eNeuro;MAY-JUN;2018;5;3;;;;;;;0060-18.2018;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0060-18.2018;;;17;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;GQ9ZP;30023427;Green Published, gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000442165100007;View Full Record in Web of Science

The central complex was subdivided into three parts on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and hodological criteria: pars parafascicularis (medial), pars media (intermediate), and pars paralateralis (lateral). The mean cross-sectional areas of cell bodies were identical (181 mum2) in the three parts in macaques. In humans they were larger in the pars parafascicularis (304 mum2) than in the other parts (248 and 240 mum2). Small local circuit neurons were found throughout the complex. Large projection neurons differed statistically in the three parts. In macaques, pars parafascicularis neurons had few dendritic stems and tips (3-11) and a short total dendritic length (2,000 mum). Pars paralateralis neurons had more ramified (5-60) and longer (5,800 mum) dendrites. They bore numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons had intermediate characteristics (5-9; 2,400 mum). In humans, pars parafascicular neurons had similar topological characteristics (3-12) but longer dendrites (3,000 mum) than in the monkey. Pars paralateralis neurons had more branched (6-71) and longer (9,000 mum) dendrites, with more numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons also had intermediate characteristics (4-25; 3,800 mum). The present study supports a tripartite subdivision of the primate central complex and demonstrates significant interspecies differences.

However, little is known about the histaminergic innervation of visual areas, or the histamine system in the primate brain, in general. We examined in Macaca mulatta the location of histamine-immunoreactive neurons and the innervation of important-cortical and subcortical visual areas by histamine-immunoreactive axons. Brain sections were treated with an antibody to histamine and processed with standard immunohistological procedures. Histamine-immunoreactive neurons (20-45 mu m in diameter) were localized bilaterally in the hypothalamus, particularly in ventral, lateral, posterior, and perimammillary hypothalamic areas. These hypothalamic cells appear to provide the sole neural source of histamine in the macaque brain. A plexus of varicose histamine-immunoreactive axons was present throughout the superior colliculus, the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the lateral posterior/pulvinar complex, and the visual cortex, including areas 17, 18, and the nearby extrastriate cortex. The axons nearly homogeneously innervated every region and layer in these structures, except for an increase in density in layer 1 of the visual cortex and in the superficial-most layers of the superior colliculus. Histaminergic axons broadly innervated every visual region examined. In comparison with the other aminergic and the cholinergic projection systems, which show considerable projection specificity, the histaminergic projection exhibited great homogeneity. The breadth of the distribution of histaminergic axons ensures that virtually all levels of visual processing in the primate can be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the neuromodulatory effects of histamine.

The functions of this top-down modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.;"[Diaz, Begona] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Diaz, Begona; Blank, Helen; von Kriegstein, Katharina] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Diaz, Begona] Univ Int Catalunya, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Basic Sci, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08195, Spain; [Blank, Helen] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [von Kriegstein, Katharina] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Psychol, D-01187 Dresden, Germany";"Pompeu Fabra University; University of Barcelona; Max Planck Society; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Technische Universitat Dresden";Diaz, B (corresponding author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;begona.diaz@upf.edu;"von Kriegstein, Katharina/C-3135-2008; Blank, Helen/GQZ-7699-2022; Díaz, Begona/H-5854-2012";"von Kriegstein, Katharina/0000-0001-7989-5860; Blank, Helen/0000-0002-5824-0811; Díaz, Begona/0000-0003-1628-4901";"Max Planck Research Group Grant; ERC-Consolidator Grant (SENSOCOM) [647051]; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, REA grant) [32867]; Juan de la Cierva fellowship [JCI-2012-12678]";"Max Planck Research Group Grant; ERC-Consolidator Grant (SENSOCOM); People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, REA grant); Juan de la Cierva fellowship";We would like to thank S.

The traditional ventroposterior medial (VPM) and ventroposterior lateral (VPL) subnuclei were easily identified, as well as the forelimb and hindlimb compartments of VPL, as they were separated by poorly staining, cell-poor septa. Septa also separated other cell groups within VPM and VPL, specifically in the medial compartment of VPL representing the hand (hand VPL). In one squirrel monkey and one galago we demonstrated that these five groups of cells represent digits 1-5 in a mediolateral sequence by injecting tracers into the cortical representation of single digits, defined by microelectrode recordings, and relating concentrations of labeled neurons to specific cell groups in hand VPL. The results establish the existence of septa that isolate the representation of the five digits in VPL of primates and demonstrate that the isolated cell groups represent digits 1-5 in a mediolateral sequence. The present results show that the septa are especially prominent in brain sections processed for vGluT2, which is expressed in the synaptic terminals of excitatory neurons in most nuclei of the brainstem and thalamus. As vGluT2 is expressed in the synaptic terminations from dorsal columns and trigeminal brainstem nuclei, the effectiveness of vGluT2 preparations in revealing septa in VP likely reflects a lack of synapses using glutamate in the septa.

This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described.

Upon generating a sequence, this model stores information on the serial order of components in a cortical buffer by means of theta-nested gamma frequency oscillations observed experimentally in cortico-striatal neurons. This model assumes the existence of at least two functionally different classes of striatal spiny neurons. One class of striatal projection neurons (S-cells) select the first component in the cortical buffer through a temporal winner-take-all mechanism implemented by lateral inhibition. The inhibition should last for at least a few hundred milliseconds. In reality, it may be mediated by GABAB receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cortico-striatal projection. The other class of striatal projection neurons (M-cells) retain the currently executed component in a cortico-BG-thalamic loop, for which the strong nonlinearity in transitions between up and down states of striatal neurons is crucial. For sequence generation at the level of striatum, the cortical neurons encoding the component selected for execution are inactivated by the feedback from the activated cortico-BG-thalamic loop. This model predicts that the transition to next component is triggered by a single external signal, i.e. the subthalamic input to the globus pallidum. This input gives a neural substrate for adjusting the rate of sequence generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To study this role, a clearer understanding of pregeniculate organization is required. Based on its connectivity and neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that this nucleus is composed of several subnuclei, suggesting the term, pregeniculate complex (PrGC). The PrGC includes a weakly developed dorsal lamina, rostrally, and a well-developed ventral lamina. The ventral lamina includes the retinorecipient and superior sublayers, rostrally, and the medial division, caudally. A thin lamina of cells lateral to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is contiguous with the PrGC; we term this the lateral division. The PrGC and the lateral division each project to the SC/NOT; the superior sublayer and medial division of the PrGC are connected reciprocally to the SC/NOT. Immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and substance P (SP) further delineate the PrGC subnuclei. The retinorecipient sublayer stains most intensely for GABA and SP. The superior sublayer and medial division also stain strongly for GABA and SP. Essentially all neurons in the lateral division are GABA-positive. The combination of tract tracing and immunocytochemistry demonstrate differences in the connectivity of the PrGC subnuclei and the lateral division with the SC/NOT. This, combined with the differential localization of GABA in the PrGC, provides a basis for further study of its functional role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A combination of single- and dual-tracer techniques was used to study their topography and to establish whether these zones occupy separate or overlapping pulvinar territories. In each case, the retinotopic distribution of tracer in the pulvinar was charted by reference to its parallel distribution within the maps of cortical areas V1 and V2. Each of the areas V3, V4, and V5 were found to connect with both the 1 degrees and the 2 degrees maps located within the inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei and to respect the previously identified topographies of these maps. However, V5 connects to a narrow zone lining the rostrolateral margin of the lateral and inferior pulvinar and V4 to a broader zone within the body of these two nuclei, which is adjacent to but separate from the V5 zone; the V3 zone overlaps both. Focal injections into cortex produce columns of pulvinar label whose trajectory defines a line of isorepresentation. The lines of isorepresentation in the 1 degrees and 2 degrees maps are approximately linear and parallel and adopt a rostrolateral to caudomedial aids; in the 1 degrees map, this aids is roughly perpendicular to the facet of the inferior pulvinar that hes adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The connections of V5 and V4 can be modelled as successive zones along the aids of isorepresentation, with registered visual topographies. The scheme is extended by existing reports that inferotemporal cortex connects to the caudomedial pole of this aids-reflecting an occipitotemporal cortical gradient, in that V1 and other prestriate areas, e.g., V3, connect to the opposite pole. Thus a simple model of the mapped volume in the pulvinar arises, in which a unidimensional cortical topography is represented orthogonally to retinal topography. Adjoining this volume medially, within the inferior and medial pulvinar, is a second, heavier zone of V5 connectivity, which is poorly topographic. Both the medial and the rostrolateral zones of V5 connectivity may overlap with previously identified regions of tectal input to the pulvinar.

The population of small endings exhibited a mean cross-sectional maximum diameter of 0.95 mu m (S.D. = 0.23), a range of diameters not overlapping that of giant endings (mean diameter = 3.46 mu m, S.D. = 0.74 mu m). Topographically, the giant endings originating from M1 were located in the same thalamic nucleus (ventroposterolateral nucleus, oral part) in which the small endings were found. In contrast, the giant endings originating from SMA and PMd were located in a thalamic nucleus (mediodorsal nucleus) distinct from the main termination zone formed by small endings. Along the rostrocaudal axis, the giant endings were distributed in a restricted zone, irrespective of the origin of the projection (M1, SMA, PMd). The dual morphology of corticothalamic endings, previously found in rodents and cats, is present in the motor system of subhuman primates for both primary and nonprimary motor cortical areas.

Hitherto, experimental studies have suggested that STN-HFS reduces the activity of STN neurons. However, some recent reports have challenged this view, showing that STN-HFS might also increase the activity of globus pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons that are under strong excitatory drive of the STN. In addition, most results emanate from studies applying acute STN-HFS, while parkinsonian patients receive chronic stimulation. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the effect of chronic (10 days) STN-HFS in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated nonhuman primate. For this purpose, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, a measure of global synaptic activity, was assessed in the basal ganglia and the motor thalamus after chronic unilateral STN-HFS. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mRNA expression, a marker of efferent metabolic activity, was additionally assessed in the globus pallidus. Chronic STN-HFS (i) reversed abnormally decreased 2-DG uptake in the STN of parkinsonian nonhuman primates, (ii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG accumulation in the GPi while COI mRNA expression was increased, suggesting global activation of GPi neurons, and (iii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG uptake in the ventrolateral motor thalamus nucleus. The simultaneous decrease in 2-DG uptake and increase in COI mRNA expression are difficult to reconcile with the current model of basal ganglia function and suggest that the mechanisms by which STN-HFS exerts its clinical benefits are more complex than a simple reversal of abnormal activity in the STN and its targets.;"Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS UMR 5227, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; CHU Pellegrin, Dept Neurol, Bordeaux, France";"UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; CHU Bordeaux";Meissner, W (corresponding author), Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS UMR 5543, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France.;wassilios.meissner@umr5543.u-bordeaux2.fr;"Bezard, Erwan/A-8173-2008; Bezard, Erwan/ABD-5153-2021; Meissner, Wassilios/C-7817-2015; Benazzouz, Abdelhamid/E-5050-2016";"Bezard, Erwan/0000-0002-0410-4638; Meissner, Wassilios/0000-0003-2172-7527; Benazzouz, Abdelhamid/0000-0002-2282-1120";;;;;80;24;25;0;5;BLACKWELL PUBLISHING;OXFORD;9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

One possible underlying pathophysiology is serotonergic dysfunction. In this study, we used an animal model of HIV, the SIV-infected macaque, to longitudinally image serotonin transporter (SERT) expression before and after inoculation, using 11C-DASB (SERT ligand) PET imaging. Methods: We infected seven rhesus macaques with a neurovirulent SIV strain and imaged them at baseline and multiple time points after inoculation (group A). Pyrosequencing methylation analysis of the SERT promoter region was performed. We also measured SERT mRNA/protein in brain single-cell suspensions from another group (group B) of SIV-infected animals (n = 13). Results: Despite some animals showing early fluctuations, 86% of our group A animals eventually showed a net increase in midbrain/thalamus binding potential (BPND) over the course of their disease (mean increased binding between last time point and baseline = 30.2% and 32.2%, respectively). Repeated-measures mixed-model analysis showed infection duration to be predictive of midbrain BPND (p = 0.039). Thalamic BPND was statistically significantly associated with multiple CSF cytokines (P < 0.05). There was higher SERT protein levels in the second group (group B) of SIV-infected animals with SIV encephalitis (SIVE) compared to those without SIVE (p = 0.014). There were no longitudinal changes in SERT gene promoter region percentage methylation between baselines and last time points in group A animals. Conclusion: Upregulated SERT leading to lower synaptic levels of serotonin is a possible mechanism of depression in HIV+ patients, and extrapolating our conclusions from SIV to HIV should be sought using translational human studies.;"[Shah, Swati; Sinharay, Sanhita; Schreiber-Stainthorp, William; Muthusamy, Siva; Lee, Dianne; Hammoud, Dima A.] NIH, CIDI, Radiol & Imaging Sci, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Matsuda, Kenta; Hirsch, Vanessa] NIAID, Lab Mol Microbiol, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wakim, Paul] NIH, Biostat & Clin Epidemiol Serv, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Nath, Avindra] NINDS, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Di Mascio, Michele] NIAID, AIDS Imaging Res Sect, Div Clin Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Clinical Center (CC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Clinical Center (CC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)";Hammoud, DA (corresponding author), NIH, CIDI, Radiol & Imaging Sci, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;hammoudd@cc.nih.gov;Hammoud, Dima A/C-2286-2015;"Schreiber-Stainthorp, William/0000-0002-7386-8754; Di Mascio, Michele/0000-0001-6609-9689; Hammoud, Dima/0000-0001-7406-7871; Sinharay, Sanhita/0000-0001-9910-996X";"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH); Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [ZIAAI000370] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Cancer Institute, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID))";Funding for this study was provided in part by the intramural research program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and by the Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH.

Using simultaneous intracortical and intrathalamic recordings, we demonstrate here that the thalamic deactivation occurring at sleep onset most often precedes that of the cortex by several minutes, whereas reactivation of both structures during awakening is synchronized. Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep. Thus, asynchronous thalamocortical deactivation while falling asleep probably explains the production of hypnagogic hallucinations by a still-activated cortex and the common self-over estimation of the time needed to fall asleep.;"[Magnin, Michel; Bastuji, Helene; Mauguiere, Francois; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, U879, F-69677 Bron, France; [Magnin, Michel; Bastuji, Helene; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Univ Lyon 1, F-69000 Lyon, France; [Rey, Marc] Hop Enfants La Timone, CHU Timone, Serv Neurophysiol Clin, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Bastuji, Helene; Mauguiere, Francois] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonct & Epileptol, F-69677 Bron, France; [Guillemant, Philippe] Univ Aix Marseille 1, Inst Univ Syst Therm Ind, F-13453 Marseille, France";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite";Magnin, M (corresponding author), Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, U879, F-69677 Bron, France.;michel.magnin@univ-lyon1.fr;mauguiere, frederic a l/C-6383-2013;"mauguiere, frederic a l/0000-0002-9150-8584; BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707; Garcia-Larrea, Luis/0000-0002-9873-789X; MAUGUIERE, Francois/0000-0003-4291-4727";;;;;49;139;142;0;17;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

NR3A is a recently identified unique modulatory subunit that decreases NMDA receptor current and calcium influx. In rodents, NR3A is developmentally expressed, displaying robust expression early in development that declines with age, reaching low levels in the adult brain. A distinct and highly selective pattern of expression is observed in the developing and mature rodent brain, suggesting that NR3A may play a very specific role in NMDA receptor-mediated processes. NR3A expression in other species, however, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the expression of NR3A mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain. Our results indicate that NR3A mRNA is expressed throughout much of the adult primate brain, and at high levels in specific brain regions including the neocortex, substantia nigra par compacta and cerebellum, as well as select areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and hypothamalamus. Western blot analysis reflects that this protein is translated and expressed in multiple brain regions. In contrast to the rat mRNA, our results suggest that NR3A transcript is widely expressed in the adult primate brain. Particular enrichment in some brain areas may reflect brain-region or circuit-specific functions for this NMDA receptor subunit. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This atlas is based on multiarchitectonic parcellation in sections parallel or perpendicular to the standard intercommissural reference plane. The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR) were used as neurochemical markers to further characterize thalamic nuclei and delimit subterritories of functional significance for stereotactic explorations. Their overall distribution reveals a subcompartmentalization of thalamic nuclei into several groups. Predominant PV immunostaining characterizes primary somatosensory, visual and auditory nuclei, the ventral lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus (R), and to a lesser degree also, lateral part of the centre median nucleus, and anterior, lateral, and inferior divisions of the pulvinar complex. In contrast, CB immunoreactivity is prevalent in medial thalamic nuclei (intralaminar and midline), the posterior complex, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, the ventral lateral anterior nucleus, ventral anterior, and ventral medial nuclei. The complementary distributions of PV and CB appear to correlate with distinct lemniscal and spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and to cerebellar and pallidal motor territories, respectively. Calretinin, while overlapping with CB in medial thalamic territories, is also expressed in R and limbic associated anterior group nuclei that contain little or no CB. Preliminary analysis indicates that interindividual nuclear variations cannot easily be taken into account by standardization procedures. Nevertheless, some corrections in anteroposterior coordinates in relation to different intercommissural distances are proposed. J. Comp. Neurol. 387:588-630, 1997.

This report analyzes the distribution of the GABA-producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), stained with monoclonal antibody, in human and rhesus monkey thalami and compares it with staining patterns of some widely used cytoskeletal and calcium binding protein markers. GAD65 immunoreactivity distinctly labeled two systems: fibers and terminals of basal ganglia thalamic afferents and local circuit neurons, revealing fine features of GABAergic circuitry in the human thalamus. Gross distribution patterns of GAD65 were identical in human and rhesus monkey thalami. The area displaying specific staining of large-caliber beaded fibers coincided with nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent territories previously identified in monkeys with anterograde tracers. Accordingly, a similarly stained region in the human thalamus was considered basal ganglia territory. Except for cytoarchitecture, no specific markers differentiating between the nigro- and pallidothalamic projection zones within this territory were found. GAD65 staining in the cerebellar afferent territory reflected organization of its local circuit neuron network, distinguishing it from adjacent nuclei. Specific GAD65 staining pattern and negative calcium binding protein immunoreactivity identify the cerebellar afferent territory in humans. It is subdivided further into ventral and dorsal regions based on the cytoskeletal protein SMI31 staining pattern.

Since tactile inputs to an opposable thumb are often spatially and temporally out of sync with inputs from the fingers, we hypothesized that inputs from the opposable thumb would be processed in an independent module in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). Here we show that in area 3b of macaque monkeys, most neurons in the thumb representation do not respond to tactile stimulation of other digits and receive few intrinsic cortical inputs from other digits. However, neurons in the representations of other 4 digits respond to touch on any of the 4 digits and interconnect significantly more. The thumb inputs are thus processed in an independent module, whereas there is a significantly more interdigital information exchange between the other digits. This cortical organization reflects behavioral use of a hand with an opposable thumb.;"[Lazar, Leslee; Chand, Prem; Rajan, Radhika; Mohammed, Hisham; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122052, India; [Lazar, Leslee] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Ctr Cognit & Brain Sci, Gandhinagar 322385, India; [Chand, Prem] VBS Purvanchal Univ, Tilak Dhari Post Grad Coll, Dept Zool, Jaunpur 222002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rajan, Radhika] Champalimaud Fdn, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, Lisbon, Portugal; [Jain, Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India; [Jain, Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, Sch AI & Data Sci, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Fundacao Champalimaud; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Jodhpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Jodhpur";Jain, N (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, NH 62, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India.;neeraj.jain@iitj.ac.in;"Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; Rajan, Radhika/0000-0002-8599-7203; Lazar, Leslee/0000-0002-2564-7324";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-I]";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)";"This work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India grant BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012, and funds from National Brain Research Centre to N.

In two animals, after denervation by amputation, it was found that electrode positions that initially recorded neurons with Rds on the amputated digit had new Rds extending from the wound. Often the new fields were on adjacent digits. Neurons with initial Rds that were partially amputated, or in some cases close to but not on the amputated digit, showed considerable expansion of the remaining RF. In three monkeys local anesthesia was used to provide a temporary denervation. In these experiments electrodes were placed in equivalent positions in both cortices. The effect on cortex contralateral to the denervation was similar to that seen with amputation. However, after esthesia returned to the digit, the expanded Rds contracted. In cortex ipsilateral to the denervation, Rds were on the opposite unaffected hand. These also rapidly expanded and then contracted, with the same time course as their counterparts in cortex contralateral to the denervation. Because of the rapidity of the expansion and its temporary nature with short-term denervation, the basis of the effect is probably an unmasking of existing but normally unexpressed connections, which are normally inhibited by the intact output from the denervated area. The wide arborization fields of thalamocortical afferents provide a potential source for the unmasked sensitivity. A mechanism for the inhibition that normally suppresses the expression of large Rds is not readily apparent. However, work in other species suggests that peripheral C fibers provide the primary source of input to central inhibitory circuits.;UNIV QUEENSLAND,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,BRISBANE,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA;University of Queensland;CALFORD, MB (corresponding author), UNIV QUEENSLAND,VIS TOUCH & HEARING RES CTR,BRISBANE,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA.;;Calford, Mike B/B-4637-2009;Calford, Mike B/0000-0002-5727-0234;;;;;44;140;140;1;4;GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC;NEW YORK;72 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV ofMacaca fascicularisandmulattamonkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with smallen passantboutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod. This relationship would serve to maintain relatively small receptive fields within the topographic representation of the face.;"[Andrew, Dona Lee E.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Occupat Therapy, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [Andrew, Dona Lee E.; May, Paul J.; Warren, Susan] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA";"University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center";Warren, S (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.;"dleandrew@aol.com; swarren@umc.edu";May, Paul J/R-7564-2019;;"NIH, NINDS [NS27996]; Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation; NIH [EY09762, EY014263]";"NIH, NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This research was supported in part by NIH, NINDS NS27996 (SW), a grant from the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation, and by NIH grant EY09762 and EY014263 to PM and SW.;;58;2;2;0;0;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5129;;;FRONT NEUROANAT;Front.

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal. territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities. These fiber morphologies resemble those from the cortex and raise the possibility that VA/VL thalamostriatal projections neurons have divergent connectional features. J. Comp.

The dense plexus of calbindin-immunoreactive fibres that characterizes VMpo in primates enables its homologue to be identified in the human thalamus by immunohistochemical labelling for calbindin. We have now analysed in detail the cytoarchitectonic characteristics of VMpo and its relationship with immunoreactivity for calbindin, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the human thalamus. The area in the posterolateral thalamus in which dense calbindin-immunoreactive fibre terminations are present:coincides nearly completely with a distinct region that contains small to medium-sized cells with round or oval shapes that are aggregated in clusters separated by cell sparse areas. This region, which we identify as VMpo, is located posteromedial to the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei, ventral to the anterior pulvinar and centre median nuclei, lateral to the limitans and parafascicular nuclei and dorsal to the medial geniculate nucleus. Calbindin-immunoreactive fibres enter VMpo from the spinal lemniscus and form large patches of dense terminal-like staining over clusters of VMpo neurons. A few of these clusters also display terminal-like substance P labelling. Small bursts of CGRP staining are intercalated between the calbindin-labelled clusters, but there is little or no overlap between these two markers. CGRP immunoreactivity is also present over small, non-clustered neurons in the calbindin-negative area that separates VMpo from the VPL and VPM nuclei, which we denote as the posterior nucleus (Po). These observations provide a concise description of VMpo in the human thalamus. Further, they suggest that the lamina I spinothalamic tract fibres (represented by calbindin and probably also substance P immunoreactivity) and vagal-solitary-parabrachial afferents (represented by CGRP immunoreactivity) form closely related, but separate, termination fields that can be considered to represent different aspects of enteroceptive information regarding the physiological status of the tissues and organs of the body. The location of VMpo and the adjacent Po fits with clinical descriptions of-the thalamic area from which pain, temperature and visceral sensations can be evoked by microstimulation, and where nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons have been recorded in humans. It also corresponds to the area in which infarcts cause analgesia and thermoanaesthesia and can lead to the paradoxical development of central pain.;"Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed & Surg, Div Cell Biol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden; Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurosurg, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA";"Linkoping University; Barrow Neurological Institute";Blomqvist, A (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed & Surg, Div Cell Biol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden.;andbl@mcb.liu.se;Blomqvist, Anders/K-3990-2019;Blomqvist, Anders/0000-0002-6928-4473;NINDS NIH HHS [NS25616] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;108;119;119;0;17;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;MAR;2000;123;;3;;;;601;619;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.3.601;;;19;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;293DV;10686182;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000085837000015;View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result of this reorganization, intact inputs from the face expand into the deafferented hand representations. Dorsal column injuries also result in permanent deficits in the use of digits for precision grip and a loss of fractionated movements of the digits. We determined whether the chronic loss of sensory inputs and the behavioral deficits caused by lesions of the dorsal columns in adult macaque monkeys affect organization of the motor cortex. The results show that, in the primary motor cortex, intracortical microstimulation evokes extension-flexion movements of the thumb at significantly fewer sites compared with the normal monkeys. There is a corresponding increase in the adduction-abduction movements. Furthermore, there is a significant increase in the thresholds of the currents required to evoke movements of the digits. Thus, long-term sensory loss in adult monkeys does not change the overall topography of the movement representation in the motor cortex but results in changes in the details of movement representations.;"[Kambi, Niranjan; Tandon, Shashank; Mohammed, Hisham; Lazar, Leslee; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH-8, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; tandon, shashank/0000-0002-8109-0129; Lazar, Leslee/0000-0002-2564-7324";Wellcome Trust [063259/Z/00/Z];Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);This work was supported by Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship Grant 063259/Z/00/Z (N.J.).

Here we describe responses of macaque PIVC neurons to three-dimensional (3D) vestibular and optic flow stimulation. We found robust vestibular responses to both translational and rotational stimuli in the retroinsular (Ri) and adjacent secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. PIVC neurons did not respond to optic flow stimulation, and vestibular responses were similar in darkness and during visual fixation. Cells in the upper bank and tip of the lateral sulcus (Ri and S2) responded to sinusoidal vestibular stimuli with modulation at the first harmonic frequency and were directionally tuned. Cells in the lower bank of the lateral sulcus (mostly Ri) often modulated at the second harmonic frequency and showed either bimodal spatial tuning or no tuning at all. All directions of 3D motion were represented in PIVC, with direction preferences distributed approximately uniformly for translation, but showing a preference for roll rotation. Spatiotemporal profiles of responses to translation revealed that half of PIVC cells followed the linear velocity profile of the stimulus, one-quarter carried signals related to linear acceleration (in the form of two peaks of direction selectivity separated in time), and a few neurons followed the derivative of linear acceleration (jerk). In contrast, mainly velocity-coding cells were found in response to rotation. Thus, PIVC comprises a large functional region in macaque areas Ri and S2, with robust responses to 3D rotation and translation, but is unlikely to play a significant role in visual/vestibular integration for self-motion perception.;"[Chen, Aihua; DeAngelis, Gregory C.; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA";"Washington University (WUSTL); University of Rochester";Angelaki, DE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, POB 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;angelaki@pcg.wustl.edu;;DeAngelis, Gregory/0000-0002-1635-1273;National Institutes of Health [R01-EY017866, EY016178];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01-EY017866 (to D.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to determine the degree of labeled overlap in both of these subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from the vibrissal representation in MI were more extensive than corresponding projections from SI. Both cortical areas sent dense projections to the dorsolateral neostriatum, but the MI vibrissal representation also projected to regions located more rostrally and medially. Despite these differences, both MI and Sl projected to overlapping parts of the dorsolateral neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the medial sector of the posterior complex of the thalamus (POm). Because POm is somatotopically organized and has reciprocal. connections with both Sl and MI cortices, the amount of labeled overlap in POm was used to indicate whether the tracers were injected into corresponding whisker representations of MI and SI. We found that the proportion of labeled overlap in the neostriatum was highly correlated with the amount of labeled overlap in POm. These results indicate that the rodent neostriatum receives convergent projections from corresponding regions in MI and SI cortex. Furthermore, the thalamocortical projections of the POm indicate that it may modulate corticostriatal outputs from corresponding representations in MI and SI.

Localization, cell surface expression, and activity-dependent regulation of glutamate receptors in both neurons and glia are performed and maintained by a complex network of protein-protein interactions associated with targeting, anchoring, and spatially organizing synaptic proteins at the cell membrane. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of transcripts encoding the AMPA receptor sub-units (GluR1-GluR4) and a family of AMPA-related intracellular proteins. We focused on PDZ-proteins that are involved in the regulated pool and anchoring AMPA subunits to the cell membrane (PICK1, syntenin), and those maintaining the constitutive pool of AMPA receptors at the glutamatergic synapse (NSF, stargazin). In addition, we studied a fifth protein, KIAA1719, with high homology to the rat PDZ protein ABP, associated with the clustering of AMPA receptors at the glutamate synapse. The AMPA subunits showed significant differences in regional expression, especially in the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. The expression of other proteins, even those related to a specific AMPA subunit (such as ABP and PICK1 to GluR2 and GluR3), often had different distributions, whereas others (like NSF) are ubiquitously distributed in the brain. These results suggest that AMPA subunits and related intracellular proteins are differentially distributed in the macaque brain, and in numerous structures there are significant mismatches, suggesting additional functional properties of the associated intracellular proteins.

Here, we describe the thalamic projections to two of these areas (V6 and V6A), based on 14 retrograde neuronal tracer injections in 11 hemispheres of 9 Macaca fascicularis. The injections were placed either by direct visualisation or using electrophysiological guidance, and the location of injection sites was determined post mortem based on cyto- and myeloarchitectural criteria. We found that the majority of the thalamic afferents to the visual area V6 originate in subdivisions of the lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei, with weaker inputs originating from the central densocellular, paracentral, lateral posterior, lateral geniculate, ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei. In contrast, injections in both the dorsal and ventral parts of the visuomotor area V6A revealed strong inputs from the lateral posterior and medial pulvinar nuclei, as well as smaller inputs from the ventrolateral complex and from the central densocellular, paracentral, and mediodorsal nuclei. These projection patterns are in line with the functional properties of injected areas: dorsal stream extrastriate area V6 receives information from visuotopically organised subdivisions of the thalamus; whereas visuomotor area V6A, which is involved in the sensory guidance of arm movement, receives its primary afferents from thalamic nuclei that provide high-order somatic and visual input.";"[Gamberini, Michela; Bakola, Sophia; Passarelli, Lauretta; Fattori, Patrizia; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, Piazza Porta S Donato 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bakola, Sophia; Burman, Kathleen J.; Rosa, Marcello G.

However, little is known about how prenatal perturbation translates into adult brain dysfunction. Here, we use a longitudinal study design to examine the effects of disruption of early gestational neurogenesis on brain volume in the non-human primate. Methods and Principal Findings: Five Rhesus macaques were exposed to x-irradiation in early gestation (E30-E41), and four control monkeys were sham-irradiated at comparable ages. Whole brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 and 5 years of age. Volumes of whole cerebrum, cortical gray matter, caudate, putamen, and thalamus were estimated using semi-automated segmentation methods and high dimensional brain mapping. Volume reductions spanning all ages were observed in irradiated monkeys in the putamen (15-24%, p = 0.01) and in cortical gray matter (6-15%, p = 0.01). Upon covarying for whole cerebral volume, group differences were reduced to trend levels (putamen: p = 0.07; cortical gray matter: p = 0.08). No group-by-age effects were significant. Conclusions: Due to the small number of observations, the conclusions drawn from this study must be viewed as tentative. Early gestational irradiation may result in non-uniform reduction of gray matter, mainly affecting the putamen and cerebral cortex. This may be relevant to understanding how early prenatal environmental insult could lead to brain morphological differences in neurodevelopmental diseases.";"[Aldridge, Kristina; Moffitt, Amanda J.; Cole, Kimberly K.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Anat Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Wang, Lei; Csernansky, John G.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Wang, Lei; Csernansky, John G.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Harms, Michael P.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Selemon, Lynn D.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Washington University (WUSTL); Yale University";Aldridge, K (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Anat Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.;aldridgek@missouri.edu;"wang, le/HKN-3406-2023; Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013";"Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388; Aldridge, Kristina/0000-0003-3924-761X; Harms, Michael/0000-0001-7945-036X";National Institutes of Health [P50-MH071616, RO1-MH59329, P50-MH44866, T32MH17104];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);National Institutes of Health grant numbers P50-MH071616, RO1-MH59329, P50-MH44866, T32MH17104.

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10-15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28-35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.;"[Hussin, Ahmed T.; Hoffman, Kari L.] York Univ, Ctr Vis Res, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Abbaspoor, Saman; Hoffman, Kari L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Hoffman, Kari L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Biomed Engn, Nashville, TN 37240 USA";"York University - Canada; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University";"Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), York Univ, Ctr Vis Res, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.;Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Biomed Engn, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.";kari.hoffman@vanderbilt.edu;Hoffman, Kari L/I-3062-2012;Hoffman, Kari L/0000-0003-0560-8157;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant [1RF1NS127128-01]; Krembil Foundation [501100004089]; Fondation Brain Canada Grant [100009408]; Whitehall Foundation [100001391]; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Society of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [501100000038]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Krembil Foundation; Fondation Brain Canada Grant; Whitehall Foundation; Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIARSpanish Government); Alzheimer's Association(Alzheimer's Association); Alzheimer's Society of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)";This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant 1RF1NS127128-01, Krembil Foundation Grant 501100004089, Fondation Brain Canada Grant 100009408, Whitehall Foundation Grant 100001391, Canada Foundation for Innovation, Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Society of Canada, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant 501100000038.

The caudomedial area, by contrast, receives input from MGv only indirectly via Al, and neurons in this area are often tuned to the spatial location of a complex sound. The belt areas on the lateral surface of the superior temporal gyrus receive input from the primary areas. Neurons in these areas respond better to more complex stimuli, such as band-pass noise pulses of frequency-modulated sweeps, than to pure tones. Often neurons in the lateral belt respond well to species-specific communication calls. The hypothesis is put forward that the central auditory pathways in the macaque monkey are organized into parallel streams, similar to the visual system, one for the processing of spatial information, the other for the processing of auditory 'patterns'. Evidence from neuroimaging studies in humans with MRI and PET are consistent with this hypothesis.

Using in situ hybridization, we examine the distribution pattern of both GAD mRNAs in the hypothalamus and thalamus of prepubertal and adult male rhesus macaques. Qualitatively, GAD(65) and GAD(67) mRNAs showed a similar wide, but highly specific distribution pattern, supporting the view that GABAergic neurons play an important role in modulating neuroendocrine function. However, no quantitative difference in the intensity of hybridization signal was detected between prepubertal and adult animals in any of the hypothalamic or thalamic nuclei. Therefore, although GABAergic neurons are anatomically well-placed to control the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in primates, it is unlikely that the onset of puberty and the associated increase in GnRH secretion is triggered by a change in GAD gene transcription.

They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an amygdalectomy in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after each operation. Disconnection of the amygdala from the ventral striatum was without effect on learning rate. An earlier study had shown that disconnection of the amygdala from either the mediodorsal thalamus or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produced only a mild impairment, significantly less severe than that produced by bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. The present results show, however, that disconnection of the amygdala from both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the same animal, by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and of both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the other hemisphere, produces an impairment as severe as that which follows bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. These results show that, in stimulus - reward associative memory, the role of the amygdala is entirely dependent on its interaction with the frontal lobe, either by direct projections or by indirect subcortical pathways including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus; and that there are at least two partially independent pathways by which the amygdala can influence the frontal lobe.";"NIMH,NEUROPSYCHOL LAB,BETHESDA,MD 20892; UPMC,CNRS,DEPT NEUROSCI VISION ACT,F-75005 PARIS,FRANCE";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite";GAFFAN, D (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;"Fabre-Thorpe, Michèle/B-2698-2008; Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019";Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642;;;;;17;112;112;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

In this study, to explore potential anatomical bases for these neuronal activities, we injected retrograde tracers (CTB-Alexa-488 and CTB-gold) into the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus and examined the distribution of labeled cell bodies in macaque monkey brains. The Nissl staining showed that the cortex in the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus has consistent layer 4 which means that the cortical region is a part of the granular prefrontal cortex. The injection site belonged to the sulcal portion of area 9m in two cases and the sulcal portion of area 8Bm in one case. In addition to the continuous distribution of labeled cells in the two areas (areas 9m and 8Bm) around the injection site, the labeled cells were densely distributed in the cingulate areas (areas 24, 32, and 23) in all the cases. The dense labeling of cells was also found in other prefrontal areas (areas 46, 10, 11, and 12) in the two cases with injection into the sulcal portion of area 9m, whereas the dense labeling of cells was found in pre-motor areas (F6 and F7) in the case with injection into the sulcal portion of area 8Bm. The dense labeling of cells in the prefrontal and premotor areas was more similar to those previously found after injections into dorsal parts of areas 9 and 8B.

Gerbella et al. (2010) Cereb. Cortex, 20, 141-168], and compared them with those to area 8/FEF (frontal eye field). Both areas 45A and 45B were the targets of highly predominant projections from the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and of additional projections, mostly from the magnocellular ventral anterior and the medial pulvinar nucleus. The projection profiles from different MD subdivisions clearly distinguished these two areas from one another and from area 8/FEF. Area 45A was the target of predominant projections from parvicellular MD and of minor, albeit robust, projections from magnocellular MD. The opposite was true for area 45B: magnocellular MD was the major source of projections and parvicellular MD contributed minor, albeit robust, projections. Furthermore, area 45B, but not area 45A, was targeted by robust projections from multiform MD, the principal thalamic nucleus for area 8/FEF. These results provide further evidence for the distinctiveness of areas 45A and 45B, and support the idea that area 45B is affiliated with the frontal oculomotor system, challenging the proposed homology of this area with part of the human language-related area 45 (rostral part of Broca's region). Furthermore, the present data provide evidence for potentially robust trans-thalamic (via magnocellular MD) afferent, as well as direct and reciprocal, amygdaloid connections of areas 45A and 45B, suggesting the contribution of emotional information to the differential role of these two areas in non-spatial information processing.;"[Baccarini, Matteo; Borra, Elena; Gerbella, Marzio; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, IIT,Unita Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Contini, Massimo] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Fisiol, Florence, Italy; [Baccarini, Matteo] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Sci Umane, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Florence; University of Ferrara";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, IIT,Unita Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019";"Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618; CONTINI, Massimo/0000-0001-9555-2366";"Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2006052343_002]; Belgian Science Policy Office [IUAP P6/29]";"Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)";"The 3D reconstruction software was developed by CRS4, Pula, Cagliari, Italy.

We tested whether this simply reflects the uneven distribution of ganglion cells in the retina in accordance with the ''principle'' of peripheral scaling, or whether there is additional expansion of the fovea and adjacent retina in the retinocortical projection. Wheatgerm agglutinated horseradish peroxidase was injected into the striate cortex of three rhesus macaque monkeys so as to surround the representation of the fovea at a mean eccentricity of 8.6 degrees, and the retinae were processed histochemically to stain the retrogradely and transneuronally labelled ganglion cells which projected topographically to the injection sites. This enabled regions of the striate cortex to be related precisely to corresponding regions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and retina. Mathematical models of the distribution of ganglion cells in the retina, dipped, three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the striate cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus, and counts of neurons in the latter, were used to calculate the proportion of neurons allocated to the marked perifoveal region at each stage of projection. This was used to calculate the relative allocation of neurons to the representation of the fovea and surrounding retina among the different stages of the visual pathway. The values obtained showed that the cortical representation of the perifovea was expanded two to three times more than could be accounted for on the basis of ganglion cell topography in the retina, and that the expansion occurred both between the retina and the thalamus, and between the thalamus and the cortex. These results are inconsistent with the idea that peripheral scaling is a general principle of sensory representation in the cortex. They could also explain why many visual thresholds, including hyperacuities, cannot be accounted for by peripheral factors such as ganglion cell density.;;;Azzopardi, P (corresponding author), DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;Azzopardi, Paul/C-5694-2013;Azzopardi, Paul/0000-0001-7386-8191;;;;;86;37;37;0;4;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;JUN;1996;72;3;;;;;627;639;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00589-7;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;UH118;9157310;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1996UH11800004;View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study examined with quantitative immunohistochemical methods the presence of glutamate in spinothalamic tract terminals of owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus). Such terminals in the posterior region, in which a nucleus was recently identified as a specific pain and temperature relay in macaques and humans, were labeled by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, injected into the spinal dorsal horn. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated with a postembedding immunogold procedure using a well-characterized glutamate antiserum. Quantitative analysis of the immunogold labeling demonstrated that the spinothalamic tract terminals contained more than twice the tissue average of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Enrichment of glutamate-like immunoreactivity was also found in terminals of presumed cortical origin. Presynaptic dendrites, cell bodies and non-vesicle-containing dendrites diplayed low levels of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.69; P<0.0001) was found between the density of synaptic vesicles and the density of gold particles in spinothalamic tract terminals, in contrast to a weak negative relationship (r=-0.28; P=0.089) present in GABAergic presynaptic dendrites.

Here, we describe a set of computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques. Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications. Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through more accurate computational models of DBS.;"[Xiao, YiZi; Zitella, Laura M.; Teplitzky, Benjamin A.; Kastl, Daniel; Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Duchin, Yuval; Adriany, Gregor; Yacoub, Essa; Harel, Noam] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Magnet Resonance Res, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";"Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.";john5101@umn.edu;"Yacoub, Essa/AAS-7757-2021; Harel, Noam/R-7391-2018; Adriany, Gregor/R-6656-2016";"Harel, Noam/0000-0002-6034-3801; Adriany, Gregor/0000-0002-6428-9005";"National Institutes of Health [R01-NS081118, R01-NS085188, P41-113015894, P30-076408, U54-MH091657]; National Science Foundation (IGERT) [DGE-1069104, 00006595]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation (IGERT)(National Science Foundation (NSF))";This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01-NS081118, R01-NS085188, P41-113015894, P30-076408, and the Human Connectome Project U54-MH091657) and the National Science Foundation (IGERT DGE-1069104 to LZ and GFRP 00006595 to BT).

The functional organization of motor responses to microstimulation throughout the primate ''motor'' thalamus including nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo); nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis (VPLo); nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc); and portions of ventralis anterior (VA) and area X, was systematically studied in awake monkeys. A total of 2,021 sites were examined for their response to microstimulation. Of these, 1,123 were histologically verified as to their location within the motor thalamus. At or near each site, isolated neurons were examined for their responses to somatosensory examination and active movement (n = 1,272). This study was carried out as pari of a larger study examining the responses of neurons in the motor thalamus to somatosensory examination, torque-induced limb per turbations, and active movement in a visuomotor step-tracking task. 2. Microstimulation at less than or equal to 40 mu A evoked movements in the contralateral limbs, trunk, or face. Evoked movements of the limb were generally maximal about a single joint. 3. There was a differential response to microstimulation between subnuclei of the motor thalamus. Tn order of decreasing frequency, the percentages of sites within each subnucleus from which movements were evoked were as follows. VPLo, 93% (449 of 483); VLo, 21% (57 of 272); VLc, 11% (15 of 140); VA, 1% (1 of 85), and reticular nucleus, 0% (0 of 65). In VPLc, 44% (34 of 78) of sites examined were microexcitable. However, these were almost all within 500 mu m of the border of VPLo, suggesting they may have occurred as a result of current spread to adjacent VPLo. Although area X was not sampled in its entirety, it did nor appear to be microexcitable. 4, Microexcitable responses had a somatotopic organization, similar to that for neuronal responses to sensorimotor examination, with leg responses found most laterally and arm and face responses found progressively more medially. 5. Zones in VPLo generally ranging from 500 to 1,500 mu m were found in which microstimulation resulted in the same motor response. These microexcitable zones resemble those described for the striatum and were termed thalamic microexcitable zones (TMZ), TMZs also resemble cortical efferent zones in that both are somatotopically organized, may affect a single muscle or group of muscles, have low thresholds for microstimulation with sharp boundaries that lie adjacent to other microexcitable zones with the opposite effects, aid are of approximately the same dimension. 6. This study suggests that a fundamental unit of motor organization, i.e., single muscle or joint, is preserved at the thalamic level in the form of TMZs, and that these fundamental units of organization may contribute to the modular organization of the cortex.";"UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT NEUROL, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55417 USA; VET ADM MED CTR, BRAIN SCI CTR, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55417 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System";Vitek, JL (corresponding author), EMORY UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, ATLANTA, GA 30322 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-01328] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;45;60;64;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Projections from the dentate and IA nuclei overlap in central parts of the body of RTP, but the terminal field of dentate axons extends dorsomedial and rostral to the terminal field of IA axons, and I4 terminal fields extend more ventrolaterally. A caudal to rostral topography of projections from each nucleus onto dorsal to ventral parts of RTP was seen. Projections from rostral parts of both nuclei terminate in a sublemniscal part of the nucleus. The topography of dentate and IA projections onto central to ventrolateral RTP appears to match somatotopic maps of these cerebellar nuclei with the somatotopic map of projections to RTP from primary motor cortex. Projections from caudal and ventral parts of the dentate nucleus appear to overlap oculomotor inputs to rostral, dorsal, and medial RTP from the frontal and supplementary eye fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor region of the caudal fastigial nucleus. Projections to the paramedian part of RTP from vestibular area y were also found in two cases that correlated with projections to vertical oculomotor motoneurons. The maps of dentate and IA projections onto RTP correlate predictably with maps of dentate and IA projections to the ventrolateral thalamus and subnuclei of the red nucleus that were made from these same cases (Stanton [1980b] J.

We employed a triple-labeling technique in the same owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The cerebellothalamic projections were labeled with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the pallidothalamic projections were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine. The pre-SMA was identified by location and movement patterns evoked by intracortical microstimulation and injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Brain sections were processed sequentially using different chromogens to visualize all three tracers in the same section. Alternate sections were processed for Nissl cytoarchitecture or acetylcholinesterase chemoarchitecture for nuclear boundaries. The cerebellar nuclei primarily projected to posterior (VLp), medial (VLx), and dorsal (VLd) divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus; the pallidum largely projected to the anterior division (VLa) of the ventral lateral nucleus and the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). However, we also found zones of overlapping projections, as well as interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label, particularly in border regions of the VLa and VApc. Thalamic neurons labeled by pre-SMA injections occupied a wide band and were especially concentrated in the VLx and VApc, cerebellar and pallidal territories, respectively. Labeled thalamocortical neurons overlapped cerebellar inputs in the VLd and VApc and overlapped pallidal inputs in the VLa and the ventral medial nucleus. The results demonstrate that inputs from both the cerebellum and globus pallidus are relayed to the pre-SMA. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:164-180, 2000.

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2-3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b-4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

The relative balance of flexible, goal-directed responding as compared to inflexible habitual responding is highly dependent on experience (e.g., training history in a task) and conditions under which the behavior was formed. Reinforcer devaluation tasks have been used widely across species to study the neurobiology of goal-directed behavior. In rodents, under some conditions, extended training in reinforcer devaluation tasks transforms goal-directed responses into habits, rendering the animals insensitive to devaluation. In nonhuman primates, no studies have previously evaluated the impact of extended training. Here we trained four macaques in a variant of the standard reinforcer devaluation task (Malkova et al., 1997), in which we presented objects with either a standard number of exposures (i.e., up to 55) or with a high number of exposures (i.e., up to 454). We tested for goal-directed behavior at three time points during the course of this extended training with different combinations of high- and low-repetition objects and stratified results based on whether the preferred or nonpreferred reinforcer was devalued. We found robust devaluation effects across all three cycles of training; however, the magnitude of the effect was modulated by reinforcer preference and by the relative training history of the objects. These data argue against habit formation after overtraining in the reinforcer devaluation task in macaques, a finding that is consistent with reports in humans and with tasks in rodents that employ multiple stimuli, reinforcers, and instrumental actions.";"[LaFlamme, Elyssa M.; Ahmed, Farris; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W215,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA";Georgetown University;"Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W215,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Forcelli, PA; Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W209B,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA.";"paf22@georgetown.edu; malkoval@georgetown.edu";;"Ahmed, Farris/0000-0001-9747-4971; LaFlamme, Elyssa/0000-0003-3820-9478; Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X";;;;;81;2;2;1;1;AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;0735-7044;1939-0084;;BEHAV NEUROSCI;Behav.

LGN responses are largely low-pass in spatial frequency, whereas the majority of V1 neurons have bandpass characteristics. To study this transformation in spatial selectivity, we measured the dynamics of spatial frequency tuning using a reverse correlation technique. We find that a large proportion of V1 cells show inseparable responses in spatial frequency and time. In several cases, tuning becomes more selective over the course of the response, and the preferred spatial frequency shifts from low to higher frequencies. Many responses also show suppression at low spatial frequencies, which correlates with the increases in response selectivity and the shifts of preferred spatial frequency.

That each of these cortical areas has a unique thalamic input was illustrated in the preceding paper. In the present experiments the cortical afferent projections to these 3 areas of the sensorimotor cortex monkey were visualized and compared, using 4 differentiable fluorescent dyes as axonal retrogradely transported labels. The cortical projection patterns to areas 3a, 3b, and 4 were similar in that they each consisted of (a) a ''halo'' of input from the immediately surrounding cortex, and (b) discrete projections from one or more remote cortical areas. However, the pattern of remote inputs from precentral, mesial, and posterior parietal cortex was different for each of the 3 cortical target areas. The cortical input configuration was least complex for area 3b, its remote input projecting mainly from insular cortex. The pattern of discrete cortical inputs to the motor area 4, however, was more complex, with projections from the cingulate motor area (24c/d), the supplementary motor area, postarcuate cortex, insular cortex, and postcentral areas 2/5. Area 3a, in addition to the proximal projections from the immediately surrounding cortex, also received input from the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, insular cortex, and areas 2/5. Thus, this pattern of cortical input to area 3a resembled more closely that of the adjacent motor rather than that of the somatosensory area 3b. Contrasting with this, however, the thalamic input to area 3a was largely from somatosensory VPLc (abbreviations from Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta.

However, recent studies in the monkey have documented projections from MD to the more caudal, agranular regions of the frontal cortex, suggesting that the connections of MD may be characterized by a breadth of distribution and diversity of functional roles too great to be useful as a unifying and defining feature for a specific cortical territory. In this study, we placed tracer injections in the lateral divisions of MD in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the relative proportions of connections devoted to diverse regions of the frontal cortex (FC). Three different patterns of label were observed in the cortex, associated with different locations within lateral MD. We have designated these as the ventrolateral MD-arcuate FC circuit, having most label in areas 8 and 6; the caudoventral MD-dorsomedial FC circuit, having most label in areas 24 and presupplementary motor area (SMA); and the anterodorsal MD-anterior FC circuit, with the most label in areas 9, 46, 12, and 10. Only two of the nine cases injected in lateral MD were predominantly connected with the anterior FC. Thus, particular locales within lateral MD are connected with multiple, functionally diverse cortical regions, including several not classically recognized as prefrontal areas. This divergence may distinguish MD-frontocortical and reciprocal corticothalamic pathways from the largely segregated pathways arising from the other thalamic nuclei that are interconnected with the frontal cortex, such as those from the ventrolateral nuclear group.

We evaluated whether apoptosis, triggered by the anesthetic sevoflurane in the brains of neonatal rhesus macaques, can be detected using quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Neonatal (n = 15) rhesus macaques underwent 5 h of sevoflurane anesthesia. QUS images were obtained through the sagittal suture at 0.5 and 6 h. Brains were collected at 8 h and examined immunohistochemically to analyze apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Significant apoptosis was detected in white and gray matter throughout the brain, including the thalamus. We measured a change in the effective scatterer size (ESS), a QUS biomarker derived from ultrasound echo signals obtained with clinical scanners, after sevoflurane-anesthesia in the thalamus. Although initial inclusion of all measurements did not reveal a significant correlation, when outliers were excluded, the change in the ESS between the pre- and post-anesthesia measurements correlated strongly and proportionally with the severity of apoptotic death. We report for the first time in vivo changes in QUS parameters, which may reflect severity of apoptosis in the brains of infant nonhuman primates. These findings suggest that QUS may enable in vivo studies of apoptosis in the brains of human infants following exposure to anesthetics, antiepileptics and other brain injury mechanisms.;"[Rosado-Mendez, Ivan M.; Castaneda-Martinez, Laura] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fis, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rosado-Mendez, Ivan M.; Guerrero, Quinton W.; Whitson, Hayley; Zagzebski, James A.; Hall, Timothy J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Phys, Sch Med, 1530 Med Sci Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Noguchi, Kevin K.; Wang, Sophie H.; Swiney, Brant S.; Masuoka, Kobe] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Kirvassilis, George] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Madison, WI USA; [Manzella, Francesca] Univ Colorado, Neurosci Program, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Capuano, Saverio, III; Brunner, Kevin G.; Crosno, Kristin; Simmons, Heather S.; Mejia, Andres F.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Brambrink, Ansgar] Columbia Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, New York, NY USA; [Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Columbia University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Ikonomidou, C (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Child Neurol, 1685 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;Ikonomidou@neurology.wisc.edu;;"Manzella, Francesca/0000-0003-1296-2015; Castaneda-Martinez, Laura/0000-0003-0104-5705; Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy/0000-0002-8961-226X";"NIH [P51OD011106, HD052664, U54-HD087011]; NIH/NICHD [R01HD083001-01A1]; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University; UNAM-PAPIIT [IA104518, IN107916]; CONACyT";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University; UNAM-PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))";"This research was supported by pilot grant award, Office of the Director, NIH P51OD011106 to WNPRC and NIH/NICHD R01HD083001-01A1 grant to C.

In this study, we used injections of retrograde tracers in the lateral portion of the monkey MD to assess the locations of labeled cells in subcortical structures. Three main patterns were identified in the distribution of subcortical connections. We found that the claustrum, superior colliculus and ventral midbrain regions were heavily labeled in the cases with injections in caudoventral MD. In these cases, labeled cells were also found in either the periaqueductal gray or zona incerta, depending on the specific case. In one case with an injection in anterodorsal MD, labeled cells were most numerous in the structures of the ventral midbrain, especially the ventral tegmental area. Finally, the claustrum and superior colliculus contained the largest percentage of labeled subcortical cells in cases with injections in ventrolateral MD. These three patterns of subcortical label corresponded to three equally distinctive trends in the distribution of MD connections with the cortex in these same cases [J Comp Neurol 473 (2004) 107]. Very few labeled cells were found in other areas such as the amygdala, globus pallidus and deep cerebellar nuclei, suggesting that pathways leading from these structures to dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices are not likely to include the lateral divisions of MD. In concert, these findings show that particular locales within lateral MD receive distinct profiles of subcortical afferents, and project into specific neocortical domains, suggesting that these different sites within lateral MD may participate in functionally distinct circuits of information processing.

It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages in binge alcohol drinking (occasional consumption of four to five drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy alcohol drinking (binge drinking on >5 d in a month). Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years of age) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following similar to 6 and similar to 12 months of daily (22 h/d) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1ml/1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol drinking reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.;"[Shnitko, Tatiana A.; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Xiaojie; Grant, Kathleen A.; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Shnitko, Tatiana A.; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Xiaojie; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Grant, Kathleen A.; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA";"Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon Health & Science University";"Grant, KA; Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.;Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;Grant, KA; Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA.";"grantka@ohsu.edu; kroenkec@ohsu.edu";;"Wang, Xiaojie/0000-0001-5557-6048; Grant, Kathleen/0000-0002-0380-7219; Shnitko, Tatiana/0000-0002-7872-7408";"NIAAA NIH HHS [U24 AA025473, U01 AA013510, R24 AA019431] Funding Source: Medline; NIH HHS [P51 OD011092] Funding Source: Medline";"NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";;;66;18;18;0;9;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;;2373-2822;;ENEURO;eNeuro;MAR-APR;2019;6;2;;;;;;;UNSP e0044-19.2019;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0044-19.2019;;;11;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;HX1RE;30993181;Green Published, gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000467170000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the neuronal specificity achieved with both methods is not well understood. Here we compare cell-targeted optogenetics and electrical microstimulation in the macaque monkey brain to functionally map the koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) projection to primary visual cortex (V1). Selective activation of the LGN konio neurons with CamK-specific optogenetics caused selective electrical current inflow in the supra-granular layers of V1. Electrical microstimulation targeted at LGN konio layers revealed the same supra-granular V1 activation pattern as the one elicited by optogenetics. Taken together, these findings establish a selective koniocellular LGN influence on V1 supra-granular layers, and they indicate comparable capacities of both stimulation methods to isolate thalamo-cortical circuits in the primate brain.;"[Klein, Carsten; Shapcott, Katharine A.; Schmid, Michael C.] Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, Deutschordenstr 46, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany; [Evrard, Henry C.] Univ Tubingen, Werner Reichardt Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Otfried Muller Str 25, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Div Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Klein, Carsten; Evrard, Henry C.; Logothetis, Nikos K.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Spemannstr 36, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Schmid, Michael C.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Klein, Carsten] Univ Tubingen, Int Max Planck Res Sch, Grad Sch Neural & Behav Sci, Osterbergstr 3, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Haverkamp, Silke] Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Max von Laue Str 4, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany";"Max Planck Society; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Max Planck Society; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society";"Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, Deutschordenstr 46, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.;Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.";michael.schmid@ncl.ac.uk;"Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019; Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020; Schmid, Michael C./G-1867-2010";"Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X; Schmid, Michael C./0000-0003-1424-130X; Evrard, Henry/0000-0001-8429-4699";"Emmy Noether grant [Schm2806/1-1]; EU grant SICODE; Max Planck Society";"Emmy Noether grant(German Research Foundation (DFG)); EU grant SICODE; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society)";"We thank Esther Bosch for assistance with histology; Joachim Werner, Hanka Klon-Lippok, Mirko Lindig, Thomas Steudel, and Deniz Ipek for technical assistance; and Drs.

In the present study, we compared the patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate (marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the species but also on the input projections.;"[Otsuka, Yukiko; Tsuge, Hitomi; Uezono, Shiori; Tanabe, Soshi; Fujiwara, Maki; Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Uezono, Shiori] Univ Tokyo Hlth Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Rehabil, Tama Ku, Tokyo 2060033, Japan; [Miwa, Miki; Nakamura, Katsuki] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Cognit Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Kato, Shigeki; Kobayashi, Kazuto] Fukushima Med Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Sch Med, Fukushima 9601295, Japan";"Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Fukushima Medical University";"Inoue, KI; Takada, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan.";"otsuka.yukiko.37s@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp; soraironokumo@gmail.com; s-uezono@u-ths.ac.jp; tanabe.soshi.67v@gmail.com; fujiwara.maki.2x@kyoto-u.acjp; miwa.miki.8m@kyoto-u.ac.jp; skato@fmu.ac.jp; nakamura.katsuki.4z@kyoto-u.ac.jp; kazuto@fmu.ac.jp; inoue.kenichi.6z@kyoto-u.ac.jp; takada.masahiko.7x@kyoto-u.ac.jp";"Kato, Shigeki/S-8016-2018; Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015";"Kato, Shigeki/0000-0002-8792-7591; Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280; Takada, Masahiko/0000-0003-0774-2333";"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [JP26112002, JP15H05879, JP17H05565, JP19H05467]; AMED [JP17dm0207052, JP21dm0207077]";"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); AMED";This work was funded by MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26112002 to K.K., JP15H05879 and JP17H05565 to K.-i.I., and JP19H05467 to M.T. and by AMED Grant Numbers JP17dm0207052 to K.K. and JP21dm0207077 to M.T.;;37;2;2;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-4915;;VIRUSES-BASEL;Viruses-Basel;JUL;2021;13;7;;;;;;;1387;;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13071387;;;15;Virology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Virology;TO4PX;34372593;gold, Green Published;;;19.07.23;WOS:000676896800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Some degree of pathway specificity in the utilization of synaptic zinc has been reported in rodents. Here, we use focal injections of the retrograde tracer sodium selenite to identify zinc-positive (Zn+) projection neurons in the monkey ventral visual pathway. After injections in V1, V4, and TEO areas, neurons were detected preferentially in several feedback pathways but, unusually, were restricted to deeper layers without involvement of layers 2 or 3. Temporal injections resulted in more extensive labeling of both feedback and intratemporal association pathways. The Zn+ neurons had a broader laminar distribution, similar to results from standard retrograde tracers. After anterograde tracer injection in area posterior TE, electron microscopic analysis substantiated that a proportion of feedback synapses was colabeled with zinc. Nearby injections, Zn+ intrinsic neurons concentrated in layer 2, but in temporal areas were also abundant in layer 6. These results indicate considerable pathway and laminar specificity as to which cortical neurons use synaptic zinc. Given the hypothesized roles of synaptic zinc, this is likely to result in distinct synaptic properties, possibly including differential synaptic plasticity within or across projections.;"[Ichinohe, Noritaka; Matsushita, Atsuko; Ohta, Kazumi; Rockland, Kathleen S.] RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ichinohe, Noritaka] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Adv, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ichinohe, Noritaka] Hirosaki Univ, Dept Neuroanat, Grad Sch Med, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368562, Japan; [Rockland, Kathleen S.] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Neural Systemat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan";"RIKEN; Kyoto University; Hirosaki University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)";Ichinohe, N (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;nichinohe@brain.riken.jp;;"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785; Matsushita, Atsuko/0000-0002-8713-4313";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [18020032, 20021033, 21119502]; National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18020032, 20021033, 21119502] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas System study on higher order brain functions'' and Elucidation of neural network function in the brain'' (18020032, 20021033) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Face perception and recognition'' (21119502) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Joint Research Programs of the National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan, and of the National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grant for Hirosaki University Institutional Research.";;85;14;14;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

This has not been studied thoroughly in primates, however, and it is not known how MITN are associated with the orbital and medial prefrontal networks. This study examined the connections of MITN in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Experiments with retrograde and anterograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) showed that MITN are strongly connected with the medial prefrontal network. The dorsal nuclei of the midline thalamus, including the paraventricular (Pa) and parataenial nuclei (Pt), had heavy connections with medial network areas 25, 32, and 14c in the subgenual region. Areas 13a and 12o, which are associated with both networks, were strongly connected with the Pt and the central intermedial nucleus, respectively. Otherwise, orbital network areas had weak connections with MITN. Anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline thalamus resulted in heavy terminal labeling in the medial prefrontal network, most notably in areas ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum (25, 32, and 14c), but also in adjacent areas (13a and 13b). Retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline labeled similar areas. The medial network, particularly the subgenual region, is involved in visceral and emotional control and has been implicated in mood disorders. The strong connections between the subgenual cortex and the Pa provide a pathway through which stress signals from the Pa may influence these prefrontal circuits.

In three macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we observed up to five finger-like protrusions that emanated from the posterior pole of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extended posteriorly between the lateral pulvinar and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. These anomalous fingers measured up to 1.7 mm in length and contained dense accumulations of neurons and glia. The fingers received a direct retinal input from the contralateral eye indicating that they were part of the LGN rather than of other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In order to determine with which subcompartment(s) of the LGN the fingers were associated (parvocellular, magnocellular, or intercalated layers), we examined the immunochemical properties and size of neurons in the fingers and LGN subcompartments. We concluded that the fingers were not associated with the intercalated layers, since neurons in the fingers did not stain with an antibody to calbindin-D28k, whereas intercalated neurons stained intensely with this antibody. In addition, neurons located in the fingers were significantly smaller than those found in the magnocellular layers but were not significantly different in size from neurons in the parvocellular layers. We therefore consider that the fingers are an anomaly of the parvocellular subcompartment of the LGN. Interestingly, in two of the three cases with anomalous fingers, we also observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae, suggesting that these two anomalies were related. In five additional animals, however, we observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae without anomalous fingers. Thus, if there are common mechanisms underlying the development of both anomalous fingers and subsidiary layers, our data indicate that they do not always result in the concomitant expression of both anomalies.;;;OBrien, BJ (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT PSYCHOL,GRAD PROGRAM BEHAV NEUROSCI,BOX 351525,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.;;O'Brien, Brendan/D-1165-2009;;;;;;25;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0302-766X;;;CELL TISSUE RES;Cell Tissue Res.;JUL;1997;289;1;;;;;11;16;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004410050847;;;6;Cell Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Cell Biology;XG820;9182596;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1997XG82000002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We further analyzed this structural functional relationship by comparing the developmental pattern of TNAP activity to the maturation of the thalamocortical afferents in the primate brain (Callithrix jacchus). Cortical expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity reflects the sequential maturation of the modality-specific sensory areas. Within the visual cortex, the regional and laminar distribution of AP correlates with the differential maturation of the magno- and parvocellular streams. AP activity, which is transiently expressed in the white matter, exhibits a complementary distributional pattern with myelin staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that AP activity is localized exclusively to the myelin-free axonal segments, including the node of Ranvier. It was also found that AP activity is gradually expressed in parallel with the maturation of synaptic contacts in them neuropile. These data suggest the involvement of AP, in addition to neurotransmitter synthesis previously suggested in the adult, in synaptic stabilization and in myelin pattern formation and put forward a role of AP in cortical plasticity and brain disorders.

Given the high prevalence of pain in diabetic patients and crosstalk between chemokines and opioids, it is pivotal to know whether neuroinfiammation-associated mediators are dysregulated in the central nervous system of diabetic primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether mRNA expression levels of glial markers, chemokines, and opioid receptors are altered in the spinal cord and thalamus of naturally occurring type 2 diabetic monkeys (n = 7) compared with age-matched non-diabetic monkeys (n = 6). By using RT-qPCR, we found that mRNA expression levels of both GFAP and IBA1 were up-regulated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of diabetic monkeys compared with non-diabetic monkeys. Among all chemokines, expression levels of three chemokine ligand-receptor systems, i.e., CCL2-CCR2, CCL3-CCR1/5, and CCL4-CCR5, were up-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys. Moreover, in the SDH, seven additional chemokine receptors, i.e., CCR4, CCR6, CCR8, CCR10, CXCR3, CXCR5, and CXCR6, were also up-regulated in diabetic monkeys. In contrast, expression levels of MOP, KOP, and DOP, but not NOP receptors, were down-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys, and the thalamus had fewer changes in the glial markers, chemokines and opioids. These findings indicate that neuroin-fiammation, manifested as glial activation and simultaneous up-regulation of multiple chemokine ligands and receptors, seems to be permanent in type 2 diabetic monkeys. As chemokines and opioids are important pain modulators, this first-in-primate study provides a translational bridge for determining the functional efficacy of spinal drugs targeting their signaling cascades.

Our specific goals were to assess the prevalence and the degree of orientation tuning in the monkey LGN and to determine if the preferred stimulus orientations of LGN neurons varied as a function of receptive-field position. The primary motivation for this research was to gain insight into the receptive-field configuration of LGN neurons and consequently into the neural mechanisms which determine the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields in primates. In both the parvocellular and magnocellular layers, the responses of the majority of individual neurons to sine-wave gratings varied as a function of stimulus orientation. The influence of stimulus orientation was, however, highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the stimulus; the greatest degree of orientation bias was observed for spatial frequencies higher than the cell's optimal spatial frequency. On a population basis, the degree of orientation bias was similar for all major classes of LGN neurons (e.g. ON vs. OFF center; parvocellular vs. magnocellular) and did not vary systematically with receptive-field eccentricity. At a given receptive-field location, LGN neurons, particularly cells in the parvocellular laminae, tended to prefer either radially oriented stimuli or stimuli oriented more horizontally than their polar axis. Our analyses of the orientation-dependent changes in spatial-frequency response functions, which was based on the Soodak et al., (1987; Soodak, 1986) two-dimensional, difference-of-Gaussian receptive-field model, suggested that the orientation bias in LGN neurons was due to an elongation of the receptive-field center mechanism which in some cases appeared to consist of multiple subunits. Direct comparisons of the orientation-tuning characteristics of LGN cells and their retinal inputs (S potentials) indicated that the orientation bias in the monkey LGN reflects primarily the functional properties of individual retinal ganglion cells. We conclude that orientation sensitivity is a significant property of subcortical neurons in the primate's geniculo-cortical pathway.";;;SMITH, EL (corresponding author), UNIV HOUSTON,COLL OPT,4800 CALHOUN BLVD,HOUSTON,TX 77204, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY-08128, P30 EY-07551, R01 EY-03611] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;79;81;82;0;3;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;DEC;1990;5;6;;;;;525;545;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800000699;;;21;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";ET862;2085469;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1990ET86200002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We combined fluorescent retrograde tracers with a double anterograde labeling technique. Multiple injections of a combination of Diamidino Yellow and Fast Blue were made into either the MI or SMA hand/arm representation as determined by intracortical microstimulation. In the same animal, biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the GPi and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei. The results revealed that the cerebellar and pallidal thalamic territories are largely separate. The ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) contained a greater density of pallidal labeling while a greater density of cerebellar label was observed more caudally in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) as well as in nucleus X (X). Moreover, we observed that the greatest coincidence of retrograde cell labeling was within the pallidal thalamic territory following the SMA injections and within the cerebellar thalamic territory following the MI injections. However, interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label were also observed particularly in the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc). In both VLo and VLc, we additionally observed coincidence between the cerebellar labeling and SMA projection neurons as well as between pallidal labeling and MI projection neurons.

Large representations of digit movements involving only the index finger (D2) and thumb (D1), were elicited from areas 1, 2, 7b, and M1. Other movements evoked from these regions were similar to ethologically relevant movements that have been described in other primates. These include combined forelimb and mouth movements and full hand grasps. However, many other movements were much more complex and could not be categorized into any of the previously described ethological categories. Movements involving specific digits, which mimic precision grips, are unique to macaques and have not been described in New World or prosimian primates. We propose that these multiple and expanded motor representations of the digits co-evolved with the emergence of the opposable thumb and alterations in grip type in some anthropoid lineages.;"[Baldwin, Mary K.

A total of 203 neurons displaying movement-related changes in activity were examined in detail. Most of these cells (69%) showed an increase in firing rate in relation to the onset of movement and could be categorized according to whether they fired in the VT task exclusively, in the IG task exclusively, or in both tasks. The proportion of cells in each category was found to vary between each of the cerebellar-receiving [oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo) and area X] and basal-ganglia-receiving [oral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and parvocellular portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)] nuclei that were examined. In particular, in area X the largest group of cells (52%) showed an increase in activity during the VT task only, whereas in VApc the largest group of cells (53%) fired in the IG task only. In contrast to this, relatively high degree of task specificity, in both VPLo and VLo the largest group of cells (similar to 55%) burst in relation to both tasks. Of the cells that were active in both tasks, a higher proportion were preferentially active in the VT task in VPLo and area X, and the IG task in VLo and VApc. In addition, cells in all four nuclei became active earlier relative to movement onset in the IG task compared with the VT task. These results demonstrate that functional distinctions do exist in the cerebellar- and basal-ganglia-receiving portions of the primate motor thalamus in relation to the types of cues used to initiate and control movement. These distinctions are most clear in area X and VApc, and are much less apparent in VPLo and VLo.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3PT, England";"University of Oxford; University of Oxford";van Donkelaar, P (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, 2C Esslinger Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;;Miall, R.

In contrast, cortical neurons exhibit heterogeneous response properties that reflect computations applied to convergent input from multiple classes of afferents, which confer to them a selectivity for behaviorally relevant features of objects. The conventional view is that these complex response properties arise within the cortex itself, implying that sensory signals are not processed to any significant extent in the two intervening structures-the cuneate nucleus (CN) and the thalamus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the responses evoked in the CN to a battery of stimuli that have been extensively used to characterize tactile coding in both the periphery and cortex, including skin indentations, vibrations, random dot patterns, and scanned edges. We found that CN responses are more similar to their cortical counterparts than they are to their inputs: CN neurons receive input from multiple classes of nerve fibers, they have spatially complex receptive fields, and they exhibit selectivity for object features. Contrary to consensus, then, the CN plays a key role in processing tactile information.;"[Suresh, Aneesha K.; He, Qinpu; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Computat Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Greenspon, Charles M.; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rosenow, Joshua M.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Grossman Inst Neurosci Quantitat Biol & Human Beh, Chicago, IL 60637 USA";"University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Shirley Ryan AbilityLab; University of Chicago";"Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Computat Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Grossman Inst Neurosci Quantitat Biol & Human Beh, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.";sliman@uchicago.edu;;"Bensmaia, Sliman/0000-0003-4039-9135; Greenspon, Charles M./0000-0002-6806-3302; He, Qinpu/0000-0003-1669-7570";National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS122333, NS095162, NS096952];National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));We thank Amit Ayer for help with the surgical procedures.

This can follow from laterally directed connections in the local circuit at the level of the cell in question but could also involve more complex interactions. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the cells relaying the retinal input display a concentric, center surround organization that in part follows from the similar organization characterizing the retinal cells providing their input. However, local thalamic inhibitory interneurons also play a role, and as we examine here, feedback from the visual cortex too. Here, we show in the primate (macaque) that spatially organized cortical feedback provides a clear and differential influence serving to enhance both responses to stimulation within the center of the receptive field and the ability of the nonclassical surround mechanism to attenuate this. In short, both center and surround mechanisms are influenced by the feedback. This dynamically sharpens the spatial focus of the receptive field and introduces nonlinearities from the cortical mechanism into the LGN.;"[Jones, Helen E.; Andolina, Ian M.; Ahmed, Bashir; Shipp, Stewart D.; Clements, Jake T.

Here we show that the receptive fields of these cells differ in size and response latency but not at random. We have found that in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) the receptive field size and response latency of neighboring neurons are significantly correlated: the larger the receptive field, the faster the response to visual stimuli. This correlation is widespread in LGN. It is found in groups of cells belonging to the same type ( e. g., Y cells), and of different types (i.e., X and Y), within a specific layer or across different layers. These results indicate that the inputs from the multiple geniculate afferents that converge onto a cortical cell ( approximately 30) are likely to arrive in a sequence determined by the receptive field size of the geniculate afferents. Recent studies have shown that the peak of the spatial frequency tuning of a cortical cell shifts toward higher frequencies as the response progresses in time. Our results are consistent with the idea that these shifts in spatial frequency tuning arise from differences in the response time course of the thalamic inputs.;"SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry; University of Connecticut";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol Sci, 33 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;YEH, CHUN-I/0000-0002-2375-0723;NEI NIH HHS [EY-05253] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;44;31;31;0;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We studied the responsiveness of neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) to electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), and the ventral subnucleus of the thalamus (VPLo) with chronically implanted electrodes. 2. All neurons examined in this study were characterized by their relation to a motor task performed by the animals. They responded to stimulation of the cortical or thalamic area with excitation from one area alone (n = 128) or from multiple areas (n = 84) of all combinations. In a majority of neurons, response latencies to both cortical and thalamic stimulation were within 5 ms. 3. A vast majority of neurons (80%) that were active during a preparatory period for forthcoming reaching movements were activated by SMA stimulation. They were activated only infrequently by SI or thalamic stimulation. 4. Movement-related neurons(active immediately before and during reaching movements) were activated by thalamic, SI, or SMA stimulation or by any combination of those stimuli. More than half of the movement-related neurons activated exclusively by either thalamic or SMA stimulation exhibited activity onset times earlier than those observed in the earliest muscles. By contrast, most movement-related neurons that responded only to SI stimulation were late in their activity onset. 5. These findings suggest that the SMA input to MI is important in developing a preparatory type of activity in MI, whereas the thalamus (VPLo) provides substantial inputs in movement execution. The roles played by inputs from SI and SMA in relation to motor execution an debatable and are discussed here with reference to previous reports.;TOHOKU UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,AOBA KU,SENDAI 980,JAPAN;Tohoku University;;;;;;;;;71;40;41;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The two principal tactile processing areas in the cerebral cortex, somatosensory areas I and II, receive direct projections from the thalamus and, as well, are linked through intracortical reciprocal connections. Tactile information may therefore be conveyed to SII, for example, over either a direct path from the thalamus or an indirect, or serial, path from the thalamus via SI. 2. Reports in recent years that tactile responsiveness within the hand area of SII was abolished by surgical ablation of the hand area of the postcentral, or SI, area of cortex in the macaque and marmoset monkeys indicated that a serial processing scheme may operate, at least in primates. However, as the surgical ablation is clearly irreversible and precludes examination of individual SII neurons in both the control and test circumstances, that is, when SI is intact and when it is inactivated, we have examined in the cat, the rabbit and the marmoset monkey the behaviour of SII neurons before, during and after the selective, rapidly-reversible inactivation of SI by means of localized cooling. 3. The results demonstrate that in the cat and rabbit, SII responsiveness is never abolished and infrequently affected by SI inactivation and that tactile inputs to SII therefore traverse a direct path from thalamus, organized in parallel with that to SI. In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), in contrast to earlier studies based on ablation of SI we found that with reversible inactivation of SI, SII responsiveness was unaffected in 25% of neurons and, although reduced in the remainder, was rarely abolished (<10% of SII neurons). 4. The results indicate that there is substantial direct thalamic input to SII, even in this simian primate, and therefore necessitate revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII.;;;Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA.;;;;;;;;30;37;37;0;2;BLACKWELL SCIENCE;CARLTON;54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA;0305-1870;;;CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P;Clin.

However, the effect of fetal irradiation on cognitive functions that are vulnerable in schizophrenia (e.g., working memory) has not been examined. Methods: Four fetally irradiated macaque monkeys (FIMs) and four age-matched controls (CONs) were tested as juveniles (12-30 months) and again as adults (similar to 5 years) on delayed spatial response (DR), a working memory task that is dependent on intact prefrontal cortical circuitry. Results: As juveniles, seven of eight monkeys learned DR; one FIM refused to test. Performance in the two groups was not different. As adults, only one FIM achieved criterion on DR. Three of four FIMs did not reach criterion at the 0-sec delay interval of the DR task, whereas all four CONs mastered DR at the maximum tested delay of 10 sec. FIMs completed fewer DR test sessions compared with CONs. In contrast, all FIMs and three of four CONs learned an associative memory task, visual pattern discrimination.

The results indicate that both areas TE and TEO receive nonreciprocal inputs from several thalamic nuclei, including paracentralis, ventralis anterior, centralis, and limitans, and that TE also receives input from reuniens. Additional nonreciprocal inputs to both areas arise from the hypothalamus, basal nucleus of Meynert, dorsal and median raphe, locus coeruleus, and reticular formation. TE and TEO are reciprocally connected with the lateral, medial, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar and with the ventral portion of the claustrum. The main subcortical nonreciprocal output from TE and TEO is to the striatum and from TEO to the superior colliculus. TE also sends a very limited projection to nucleus medialis dorsalis magnocellularis of the thalamus. Although the connections of areas TE and TEO are overlapping in most subcortical structures, they are partially segregated in the pulvinar, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the striatum. Specifically, relative to those of TE, the projections of TEO are located more laterally in the medial, lateral, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar, more ventrally in the reticular nucleus, and more caudally in both the ventral putamen and tail and head of the caudate nucleus.

With each saccade, the image jumps on the retina, causing a discontinuity in visual input. Our visual perception, however, remains stable. Philosophers and scientists over centuries have proposed that visual stability depends upon an internal neuronal signal that is a copy of the neuronal signal driving the eye movement, now referred to as a corollary discharge (CD) or efference copy. In the old world monkey, such a CD circuit for saccades has been identified extending from superior colliculus through MD thalamus to frontal cortex, but there is little evidence that this circuit actually contributes to visual perception. We tested the influence of this CD circuit on visual perception by first training macaque monkeys to report their perceived eye direction, and then reversibly inactivating the CD as it passes through the thalamus. We found that the monkey's perception changed; during CD inactivation, there was a difference between where the monkey perceived its eyes to be directed and where they were actually directed. Perception and saccade were decoupled. We established that the perceived eye direction at the end of the saccade was not derived from proprioceptive input from eye muscles, and was not altered by contextual visual information. We conclude that the CD provides internal information contributing to the brain's creation of perceived visual stability.

Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.;"[Bakken, Trygve E.; van Velthoven, Cindy T.

Rehabilitation involving sensory retraining can improve perceptual function, presumably through plasticity mechanisms in the somatosensory processing network. However, virtually nothing is known about the effects of rehabilitation strategies on brain organization, or where the effects are mediated. In this study, five macaque monkeys received months of enriched sensory experience after median nerve cut and repair early in life. Subsequently, the sensory representation of the hand in primary somatosensory cortex was mapped using multiunit microelectrodes. Additionally, the primary somatosensory relay in the thalamus, the ventroposterior nucleus, was studied to determine whether the effects of the enrichment were initiated subcortically or cortically. Age-matched controls included six monkeys with no sensory manipulation after median nerve cut and regeneration, and one monkey that had restricted sensory experience after the injury. The most substantial effect of the sensory environment was on receptive field sizes in cortical area 3b. Significantly greater proportions of cortical receptive fields in the enriched monkeys were small and well localized compared to the controls, which showed higher proportions of abnormally large or disorganized fields. The refinements in receptive field size and extent in somatosensory cortex likely provide better resolution in the sensory map and may explain the improved functional outcomes after rehabilitation in humans.;Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA;Vanderbilt University;Florence, SL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 36469] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;61;29;30;0;1;BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

The present study was undertaken in the context of surgical treatment of motor disorders such as essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to precisely determine the course and three-dimensional stereotactic localisation of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts in the human brain. The course of the fibre tracts to the thalamus was traced in the subthalamic region using multiple staining procedures and their entrance into the thalamus determined according to our atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia [Morel (2007) Stereotactic atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia. Informa Healthcare Inc., New York]. Stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates were determined by sectioning thalamic and basal ganglia blocks parallel to stereotactic planes and, in two cases, by correlation with magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the same brains prior to sectioning. The major contributions of this study are to provide: (1) evidence that the bulks of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts are clearly separated up to their thalamic entrance, (2) stereotactic maps of the two tracts in the subthalamic region, (3) the possibility to discriminate between different subthalamic fibre tracts on the basis of immunohistochemical stainings, (4) correlations of histologically identified fibre tracts with high-resolution MRI, and (5) evaluation of the interindividual variability of the fibre systems in the subthalamic region.

In contrast, the granular region on the dorsal surface closely resembled area 8Ad in macaques and had connections restricted to posterior parietal cortex primarily associated with visuospatial functions. However, it also had connections with limbic cortex, including retrosplenial and caudal cingulate cortex as well as auditory processing regions in the superior temporal cortex. The granular region on the lateral convexity had the most extensive connections. Based on its architectonics and functionality, it resembled areas 12/45 in macaques.

Comp. Neurol. 477:119-148). Microelectrode recordings from clusters of selectively thermoreceptive or nociceptive neurons were used to guide precise microinjections of various tracers in VMpo. A prior report (Craig and Zhang [2006] J. Comp. Neurol. 499:953-964) described retrograde tracing results, which confirmed the selective lamina I input to VMpo and the anteroposterior (head to foot) topography. The present report describes the results of microinjections of anterograde tracers placed at different levels in VMpo, based on the anteroposterior topographic organization of selectively nociceptive units and clusters over nearly the entire extent of VMpo. Each injection produced dense, patchy terminal labeling in a single coherent field within a distinct granular cortical area centered in the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus. The terminations were distributed with a consistent anteroposterior topography over the posterior half of the superior limiting sulcus. These observations demonstrate a specific VMpo projection area in dorsal posterior insular cortex that provides the basis for a somatotopic representation of selectively nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic activity. These results also identify the VMpo terminal area as the posterior half of interoceptive cortex; the anterior half receives input from the vagal-responsive and gustatory neurons in the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus.

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.;"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;s.sherman@sunysb.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY11409, EY11494, EY12936, EY0308] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;98;454;459;3;41;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;;;NEURON;Neuron;Jan 17;2002;33;2;;;;;163;175;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00582-7;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;513PU;11804565;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000173387700005;View Full Record in Web of Science

How orientation tuning arises within V1 is still controversial(1,3-17). To study this problem, we measured how the orientation tuning of neurons evolves with time(18-20) using a new method: reverse correlation in the orientation domain. Orientation tuning develops after a delay of 30-45 milliseconds and persists-for 40-85 ms. Neurons in layers 4C alpha or 4C beta, which receive direct input from the thalamus, show a single orientation preference which remains unchanged throughout the response period. In contrast, the preferred orientations of output layer neurons (in layers 2, 3, 4B, 5 or 6) usually change with time, and in many cases the orientation tuning may have more than one peak This difference in dynamics is accompanied by a change in the sharpness of orientation tuning; cells in the input layers are more broadly tuned than cells in the output layers. Many of these observed properties of output layer neurons cannot be explained by simple feedforward models(1,3-6), whereas they arise naturally in feedback networks(7-17). Our results indicate that V1 is more than a bank of static oriented filters; the dynamics of output layer cells appear to be shaped by intracortical feedback.";;;Ringach, DL (corresponding author), NYU,CTR NEURAL SCI,4 WASHINGTON PL,NEW YORK,NY 10003, USA.;;;Shapley, Robert/0000-0003-0099-9849;;;;;30;426;427;0;40;MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD;LONDON;PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW;0028-0836;;;NATURE;Nature;May 15;1997;387;6630;;;;;281;284;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/387281a0;;;4;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;WZ167;9153392;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1997WZ16700052;View Full Record in Web of Science

The spinothalamic tract (STT) is an integral pathway in the transmission of nociceptive information to the brain, yet the stage of development when axons from cells in the spinal cord reach the thalamus is unknown. Therefore, the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold was used to characterize the STT at several stages of development in the mouse, a species in which the STT was previously unexamined. One-week-old, 2-day-old and embryonic-day-18 mice did not differ from adults in the number or distribution of retrogradely labeled SIT neurons. Approximately 3,500 neurons were retrogradely labeled from one side of the thalamus in each age group. Eighty percent of the labeled cells were located on the side of the spinal cord contralateral to the injection site. Sixty-three percent of all labeled cells were located within the cervical cord, 18% in thoracic cord, and 19% in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Retrogradely labeled cells significantly increased in diameter over the first postnatal week. Arborizations and boutons within the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus were observed after the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the neonatal spinal cord. These data indicate that, whereas neurons of the STT continue to increase in size during the postnatal period, their axons reach the thalamus before birth and possess some of the morphological features required for functionality.

The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.;"[Bollimunta, Anil; Mo, Jue; Ding, Mingzhou] Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10027 USA";"State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Columbia University";Ding, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;mding@bme.ufl.edu;Mo, Jue/B-3742-2014;;NIMH NIH HHS [MH79388, R21 MH087275, MH60358, MH87275, R01 MH079388-01A1, R21 MH087275-01A1, R01 MH060358, R01 MH079388, R01 MH060358-09A1] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;57;277;281;0;39;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

To understand the neural relationship of the PMC with the rest of the brain, we injected its component areas with four different anterograde and retrograde tracers in the cynomolgus monkey and found that all PMC areas are interconnected with each other and with the anterior cingulate, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal, the lateral parietal cortices, and area TPO, as well as the thalamus, where projections from some of the PMC areas traverse in an uninterrupted bar-like manner, the dorsum of this structure from the posteriormost nuclei to its rostralmost tip. All PMC regions also receive projections from the claustrum and the basal forebrain and project to the caudate, the basis pontis, and the zona incerta. Moreover, the posterior cingulate areas are interconnected with the parahippocampal regions, whereas the medial parietal cortex projects only sparsely to the presubiculum. Although local interconnections and shared remote connections of all PMC components suggest a functional relationship among them, the distinct connections of each area with different neural structures suggests that distinct functional modules may be operating within the PMC. Our study provides a large-scale map of the PMC connections with the rest of the brain, which may serve as a useful tool for future studies of this cortical region and may contribute to elucidating its intriguing pattern of activity seen in recent functional imaging studies.;"Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ So Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA";"University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Southern California";Parvizi, J (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;jparvizi@bidmc.harvard.edu;Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019;Buckwalter, Joseph/0000-0001-9758-7255;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 14944, P01 NS019632, P01 NS 19632, R01 NS014944] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;34;234;235;0;10;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Pie describe the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle lesions, review lesions described in literature, and discuss possible pharmacologic mechanisms for soman-induced neuron necrosis. Methods: In this retrospective, histopathologic study, records were obtained for 36 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were euthanized 10 days after soman exposure, from a larger group of 103 monkeys that were exposed to soman and used for pharmacologic and lethality studies. Results: Brain lesions were seen in 9 of 15 animals that convulsed and in only 1 of 21 that did not convulse. The brain lesions in our primates were limited to the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (of one animal), and consisted of neuron necrosis and dropout, spongiosis, gliosis, astrocytosis, and vascularization, Heart lesions consisted of myocardial degeneration and necrosis. Three animals had brain and heart lesions, 7 had brain lesions only, and 3 had heart Lesions only. Skeletal muscle lesions, although minimal to mild, were in most of the animals, whether they had convulsed, but most had muscular tremors. These lesions were in the biceps brachii (11 of 22 monkeys), anterior tibialis (8/22), biceps femoris (7/22), flexor carpi radialis (5/22), gastrocnemius (3/22), and diaphragm (1/22). The limited literature on soman lesions in primate brain and heart, and the limited information on skeletal muscle lesions, is reviewed. Conclusions: Brain lesions were not as wide-spread as reported in other studies of primates and rodents, and were significantly associated with convulsions. Unlike other studies using rodents, we observed poor correlation between heart and brain lesions; thus, a single hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis for the brain and heart lesions may be difficult to establish.";USA, Med Res Inst Chem Def, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA;Research Institute of Chemical Defense - China;Britt, JO (corresponding author), USA, Med Res Inst Chem Def, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA.;;;;;;;;30;27;31;0;4;AMER ASSOC LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE;MEMPHIS;9190 CRESTWYN HILLS DR, MEMPHIS, TN 38125 USA;1058-2401;;;COMPARATIVE MED;Comparative Med.;APR;2000;50;2;;;;;133;139;;;;;;7;"Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";317CA;10857003;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000087206900006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The superficial thalamocortical (T-C) projections, terminating in the (superficial half of) cortical layer I, arise mainly from the nucleus ventralis anterior, pars principalis (VApc) and nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and possibly from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis (VLm) and nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc). The VApc gives rise to the superficial T-C and deep T-C projections onto the postarcuate premotor area around the arcuate genu and spur, and onto the dorsomedial part of the caudal premotor area as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA). The VApc also gives rise to only deep T-C projections onto the remaining premotor area and onto the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus as well as the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level of the premotor area. The VLo gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the ventrolateral part of the motor area (mainly to the forelimb motor area) and onto the dorsomedial part to the mesial cortex at the rostral level of the motor area.

To address this issue, we analyzed the distribution patterns of cortico-striatal and cortico-brainstem axon terminals and the origin of thalamocortical and intracortical fibers by injecting anterograde/ retrograde tracers into physiologically and morphologically defined jaw movement-related cortical areas. Four areas were identified in the macaque monkey: the primary and supplementary orofacial motor areas (MIoro and SMAoro) and the principal and deep parts of the cortical masticatory area (CMaAp and CMaAd), where intracortical microstimulation produced single twitch-like or rhythmic jaw movements, respectively. Tracer injections into these areas labeled terminals in the ipsilateral putamen in a topographic fashion (MIoro vs. SMAoro and CMaAp vs. CMaAd), in the lateral reticular formation and trigeminal sensory nuclei contralaterally (MIoro and CMaAp) or bilaterally (SMAoro) in a complex manner of segregation vs. overlap, and in the medial parabranchial and Kolliker-Fuse nuclei contralaterally (CMaAd). The MIoro and CMaAp received thalamic projections from the ventrolateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei, the SMAoro from the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei, and the CMaAd from the ventroposteromedial nucleus. The MIoro, SMAoro, CMaAp, and CMaAd received intracortical projections from the ventral premotor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and rostral cingulate motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and area 7b, and various sensory areas. In addition, the MIoro and CMaAp received projections from the three other jaw movement-related areas.

We correlated changes in PV and Cal staining patterns with the well-documented developmental sequence for primate striate cortex neuron generation and maturation, synaptogenesis, and thalamocortical axon interactions in an attempt to deduce a functional role for these proteins. Our major finding is that Cal and PV have diametrically opposed developmental patterns except in layer 1. At F60 days both are present only in neurons of layer 1 and the number of labeled cell bodies and processes increases up to F125 days. Almost all Cal+ and PV+ cells in layer 1 disappear by P12 weeks. Cal is present by F113 days in pyramidal and stellate neurons, particularly layers 4-6. The number and staining density of cells in layers 2-6 increases up to birth and then both decline by P9-12 weeks. Supragranular layers show a second increase in Cal labeling from P20-36 weeks, and then there is a slow decline to the adult pattern which is reached by P1-2 years. Cell bodies in layers 4A, 4C-alpha, and deep 4C-beta are heavily Cal+ during pre-and early post-natal periods, but upper 4C-beta remains unlabeled. PV is not seen until F155-162 days in layers 2-6. Large stellate and a few pyramidal cells appear first in layers 5/6 and 4C-alpha, but PV+ cell stellate neurons are found in all layers except 4C-beta by P6 weeks. Layer 4C-beta contains a few PV+ cell bodies at P3 weeks, and light neuropile 4C-beta exceeds that of 4C-alpha. Striate cortex has an adult pattern of cell number and neuropile density by P20 weeks. These developmental patterns suggest that the highest density of Cal cell body staining does not correlate with synaptogenesis, or the postnatal critical period of visually driven, binocular interactions. Rather Cal appears when lateral geniculate axons arrive in cortex, persists over the entire span of thalamocortical interactions, and disappears during the decline of cortical plasticity. The appearance of PV is highly correlated with the onset of complex visually driven activity at birth, while both the number of PV+ cell bodies and the density of PV+ neuropile reach adult levels coincident with the completion of thalamocortical connections.;"UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT OPHTALMOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV FRIBOURG, INST HISTOL & GEN EMBRYOL, CH-1700 FRIBOURG, SWITZERLAND";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Fribourg";HENDRICKSON, AE (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT BIOL STRUCT, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.;;Celio, Marco R/O-5193-2014;Celio, Marco R/0000-0002-3623-842X;NEI NIH HHS [EY04536, EY01208, EY01730] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;89;140;140;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.;"[Jansen, Michael; Jin, Jianzhong; Li, Xiaobing; Lashgari, Reza; Kremkow, Jens; Swadlow, Harvey A.; Zaidi, Qasim; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Biol Sci, Dept Biol & Vis Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Bereshpolova, Yulia; Swadlow, Harvey A.; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lashgari, Reza] Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Brain Engn Res Ctr, POB 193955746, Tehran, Iran; [Kremkow, Jens] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Neurosci Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry; University of Connecticut; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;"Abrishami Moghaddam, Hamid/AAW-9288-2021; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022";"Kremkow, Jens/0000-0001-7077-4528; Lashgari, Reza/0000-0003-1768-8342";National Institute of Health [EY027361];National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);Supported by the National Institute of Health (EY027361).;;87;28;28;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

The first network consists of ten feedforward levels where a Poisson spike train with varying firing rate is applied as an input in layer one. Although the balanced state partially avoids spike synchronization during the transmission, the average firing-rate in the last layer either decays or saturates depending on the feedforward pathway gain. The last layer activity is almost independent of the input even for a carefully chosen intermediate gain. Adding connections to the feedforward pathway by a nine areas Pulvinar structure improves the firing-rate propagation to become almost linear among layers. Incoming strong pulvinar spikes balance the low feedforward gain to have a unit input-output relation in the last layer. Pulvinar neurons evoke a bimodal activity depending on the magnitude input: synchronized spike bursts between 20 and 80 Hz and an asynchronous activity for very both low and high frequency inputs. In the first regime, spikes of last feedforward layer neurons are asynchronous with weak, low frequency, oscillations in the rate. Here, the uncorrelated incoming feedforward pathway washes out the synchronized thalamic bursts. In the second regime, spikes in the whole network are asynchronous. As the number of cortical layers increases, long-range pulvinar connections can link directly two or more cortical stages avoiding their either saturation or gradual activity falling. The Pulvinar acts as a shortcut that supplies the input-output firing-rate relationship of two separated cortical areas without changing the strength of connections in the feedforward pathway.;"[Cortes, Nelson] CHNO Quinze Vingts, CNRS U7210, INSERM, UMRS UPMC 968,Inst Vis, F-75012 Paris, France; [van Vreeswijk, Carl] Univ Paris 05, Ctr Neurophys, Physiol & Pathol, Paris, France; [van Vreeswijk, Carl] CNRS UMR 8119, Paris, France";"CHNO des Quinze-Vingts; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite";Cortes, N (corresponding author), CHNO Quinze Vingts, CNRS U7210, INSERM, UMRS UPMC 968,Inst Vis, 17 Rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France.;nelsoncortesh@gmail.com;;;"Franco-Chilean Government; CONICYT;  [ANR-09-SYSC-002-02]";"Franco-Chilean Government; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); ";We thank Paul-Henri Prevot, German Mato, and David Golomb for valuable comments and their careful reading of the manuscript.

Most physiological studies of single neurons in the auditory cortex have focused on the onset and sustained portions of evoked responses, but there have been far fewer studies on the relationship between onset and offset responses. In the current study, we compared spectral and spatial tuning of onset and offset responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and the caudolateral (CL) belt area of awake macaque monkeys. Several different metrics were used to determine the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in both frequency and space domains. In the frequency domain, a substantial proportion of neurons in A1 and CL displayed highly dissimilar best stimuli for onset-and offset-evoked responses, although even for these neurons, there was usually a large overlap in the range of frequencies that elicited onset, and offset responses and distributions of tuning overlap metrics were mostly unimodal. In the spatial domain, the vast majority of neurons displayed very similar best locations for onset-and offset-evoked responses, along with unimodal distributions of all tuning overlap metrics considered. Finally, for both spectral and spatial tuning, a slightly larger fraction of neurons in A1 displayed nonoverlapping onset and offset response profiles, relative to CL, which supports hierarchical differences in the processing of sounds in the two areas. However, these differences are small compared with differences in proportions of simple cells (low overlap) and complex cells (high overlap) in primary and secondary visual areas. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the current study, we examine the relationship between the tuning of neural responses evoked by the onset and offset of acoustic stimuli in the primary auditory cortex, as well as a higher-order auditory area-the caudolateral belt field-in awake rhesus macaques. In these areas, the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in frequency and space domains formed a continuum, ranging from highly overlapping to highly nonoverlapping.;"[Ramamurthy, Deepa L.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Ramamurthy, DL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;dlramamurthy@ucdavis.edu;Ramamurthy, Deepa/HOH-5885-2023;Ramamurthy, Deepa/0000-0003-4064-5148;"National Institute on Aging [R01AG034137]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC015232]; National Eye Institute [2T32EY015387-11]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1148897]";"National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF))";"Funding for this work was provided by the National Institute on Aging (Grant R01AG034137) and National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (Grant R01DC015232; both to G.

THE ROLE OF CORTICOCORTICAL LOOPS;BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; PATTERNS; V1";This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a higher area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.;;;MUMFORD, D (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV,DEPT MATH,1 OXFORD ST,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138, USA.;;;;;;;;31;726;730;1;28;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0340-1200;;;BIOL CYBERN;Biol.

Among the limbic cortical connections, the ones with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are particularly salient. Sensory cortices connected with the OfC include areas involved in olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. Subcortical structures with prominent OfC connections include the amygdala. numerous thalamic nuclei. the striatum, hypothalamus. periaqueductal gray matter, and biochemically specific cell groups in the basal forebrain and brainstem. Architectonic and connectional evidence supports parcellation of the OfC. The rostrally placed isocortical sector is mainly connected with isocortical areas, including sensory areas of the auditory, somatic and visual modalities, whereas the caudal non-isocortical sector is principally connected with non-isocortical areas, and, in the sensory domain, with olfactory and gustatory areas. The connections of the isocortical and non-isocortical orbital sectors with the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter are also specific. The medial sector of the OfC is selectively connected with the hippocampus. posterior parahippocampal cortex, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial areas, and area prostriata, while the lateral orbitofrontal sector is the most heavily connected with sensory areas of the gustatory, somatic and visual modalities, with premotor regions, and with the amygdala.;Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morphol, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;Autonomous University of Madrid;Cavada, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morphol, Arzobispo MOrcillo S-N, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.;carmen.cavada@uam.es;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cruz-Rizzolo, Roelf J/E-4172-2012; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020; Tejedor, Jaime/G-7728-2015";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Tejedor Fraile, Jaime/0000-0001-5507-5622; Cruz-Rizzolo, Roelf/0000-0002-0920-0581";;;;;183;710;724;0;62;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

The pattern of anatomical connections from the primate auditory cortex to the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal lobes suggests a possible division into dorsal and ventral auditory processing streams, with the dorsal stream originating from more caudal areas of the auditory cortex, and the ventral stream originating from more rostral areas. These streams are hypothesized to be analogous to the well-established dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In the visual system, the dorsal processing stream shows substantially faster neural response latencies than does the ventral stream. However, the relative timing of putative dorsal and ventral stream processing has yet to be explored in other sensory modalities. Here, we compare distributions of neural response latencies from 10 different areas of macaque auditory cortex, confirmed by individual anatomical reconstructions, to determine whether a similar timing advantage is found for the hypothesized dorsal auditory stream. Across three varieties of auditory stimuli (clicks, noise, and pure tones), we find that latencies increase with hierarchical level, as predicted by anatomical connectivity. Critically, we also find a pronounced timing differential along the caudal-to-rostral axis within the same hierarchical level, with caudal (dorsal stream) latencies being faster than rostral (ventral stream) latencies. This observed timing differential mirrors that found for the dorsal stream of the visual system, suggestive of a common timing advantage for the dorsal stream across sensory modalities.;"[Camalier, Corrie R.; D'Angelo, William R.; Sterbing-D'Angelo, Susanne J.; Hackett, Troy A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [de la Mothe, Lisa A.; Hackett, Troy A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hearing & Speech Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [de la Mothe, Lisa A.] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Camalier, Corrie R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Nashville, TN 37232 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Tennessee State University; Vanderbilt University";Camalier, CR (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;corrie.camalier@vanderbilt.edu;Sterbing-D'Angelo, Susanne J/H-5899-2012;Sterbing, Susanne/0000-0002-8958-6938;"National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01 DC-04318]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P30 HD15052]";"National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))";The authors thank Warren Lambert for statistical consultation.

He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior media (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely. the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological Studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission. while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.

Results were obtained using chronic recording techniques in awake or lightly tranquilized animals. Most neurons were unable to follow the temporal order of vibrations in excess of 10 Hz. A smaller sample of cells provided faithful reproduction of frequencies up to 50-75 Hz and another responded to low amplitude, high frequency stimulation in excess of 100 Hz. Cells that displayed temporally cohesive responses to lower frequencies demonstrated predictable, time-locked discharges to successive stimulus cycles. Cells activated by higher frequencies showed a lower probability of following successive stimulus cycles. These findings are discussed in reference to the hypothesis that SII may provide a parallel channel for processing high frequency vibrotactile inputs from Pacinian receptors.;;;BURTON, H (corresponding author), WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,660 S EUCLID AVE,ST LOUIS,MO 63110, USA.;;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [NIDCD 00096] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;36;47;48;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;Jan 04;1991;538;1;;;;;127;135;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(91)90386-A;;;9;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;EP963;2018924;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1991EP96300019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico-cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task-dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large-scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large-scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.;"[Eradath, Manoj K.; Pinsk, Mark A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University";Eradath, MK (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;meradath@princeton.edu;Eradath, Manoj Kumar/AAT-4001-2021;Eradath, Manoj Kumar/0000-0003-3300-4772;"National Eye Institute [2R01EY017699]; National Institute of Mental Health [2R01MH064043, P50MH109429]";"National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";"National Eye Institute, Grant/Award Number: 2R01EY017699; National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Numbers: 2R01MH064043, P50MH109429";;91;7;7;2;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

One of the most salient models for studying the functional specialization of parallel visual streams in the primate brain is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus, through which the parvocellular and magnocellular channels, On-center and Off-center channels, and ipsilateral and contralateral eye channels are maintained and provide the foundation for cortical processing. We examined three aspects of neural processing in these streams: (1) the relationship between extraclassical surround suppression, a widespread visual computation thought to represent a canonical neural computation, and the parallel channels of the LGN; (2) the magnitude of binocular interaction in the parallel streams; and (3) the magnitude of suppression elicited by perceptual competition (binocular rivalry) in each stream. Our results show that surround suppression is almost exclusive to Off channel cells; further, we found evidence for two different components of monocular surround suppression-an early-stage suppression exhibited by all magnocellular cells, and a late-stage suppression exhibited only by Off cells in both the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways. This finding indicates that stream-specific circuits contribute to surround suppression in the primate LGN and suggests a distinct role for suppression in the Off channel to the cortex. We also examined the responses of LGN neurons in alert macaque monkeys to determine whether neurons that supply the cortex with visual information are influenced by stimulation of both eyes. Our results demonstrate that LGN neurons are not influenced by stimulation of the non-dominant eye. This was the case when dichoptic stimuli were presented to classical receptive fields of neurons, extraclassical receptive fields of neurons, and when stimuli were appropriate to produce the perception of binocular rivalry.";"[Lankow, Benjamin S.; Usrey, W.

Although its anatomy is well known, in particular thanks to studies in non-human primates, its role in perception and cognition remains poorly understood. Here, we used resting-state functional connectivity from a large sample of high-resolution data provided by the Human Connectome Project, combined with a large-scale meta-analysis approach to segregate and characterize the functional organization of the pulvinar nucleus. We identified five clusters per pulvinar with distinct connectivity profiles and determined their respective coactivation patterns. Using the Neurosynth database, we then investigated the functional significance of these co-activation networks. Our results confirm the functional heterogeneity of the pulvinar, revealing clearcut differences across clusters in terms of their connectivity patterns and associated cognitive domains. While the anterior and lateral clusters appear to be involved in action and attention domains, the ventromedial and dorsomedial clusters may preferentially subserve emotional processes and saliency detection. In contrast, the inferior cluster shows less specificity but correlates with perception and memory processes. Collectively, our results suggest that the pulvinar underwrites different components of cognition, supporting a central role in the coordination of cortico-subcortical processes mediated by distributed brain networks.;"[Guedj, Carole; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med, Neurosci Dept, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Sch Geneva, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland";;Guedj, C (corresponding author), Univ Med, Neurosci Dept, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Sch Geneva, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.;carole.guedj@unige.ch;Vuilleumier, Patrik/AAJ-1839-2021;"Vuilleumier, Patrik/0000-0002-8198-9214; Guedj, Carole/0000-0001-9477-8873";"Swiss National Science Foundation [320030_166704]; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University;  [1U54MH091657]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [320030_166704] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)";"Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; ; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";"This work was supported by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to PV [grant number 320030_166704].

Numerous brain mechanisms probably contribute to discounting this jitter. Changes in the timing of responses in the visual thalamus associated with fixational saccades are considered in this study. Activity of single neurons in alert monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was recorded during fixation while pseudorandom visual noise stimuli were presented. The position of the stimulus on the display monitor was adjusted based on eye position measurements to control for changes in retinal locations due to eye movements. A method for extracting nonstationary first-order response mechanisms was applied, so that changes around the times of saccades could be observed. Saccade-related changes were seen in both amplitude and timing of geniculate responses. Amplitudes were greatly reduced around saccades. Timing was retarded slightly during a window of about 200 ms around saccades. That is, responses became more sustained. These effects were found in both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Timing changes in LGN might play a role in maintaining cortical responses to visual stimuli in the presence of eye movements, compensating for the spatial shifts caused by saccades via these shifts in timing.;Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30912 USA;"University System of Georgia; Augusta University";Saul, AB (corresponding author), Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.;asaul@mcg.edu;;;Knights Templar Educational Foundation;Knights Templar Educational Foundation;Supported by Knights Templar Educational Foundation.

While some forms of hearing deficits are peripheral in origin, others are centrally mediated. One such deficit is the ability to localize sounds, a critical component for segregating different acoustic objects and events, which is dependent on the auditory cortex. Recent evidence indicates that in aged animals the normal sharpening of spatial tuning between neurons in primary auditory cortex to the caudal lateral field does not occur as it does in younger animals. As a decrease in inhibition with aging is common in the ascending auditory system, it is possible that this lack of spatial tuning sharpening is due to a decrease in inhibition at different periods within the response. It is also possible that spatial tuning was decreased as a consequence of reduced inhibition at non-best locations. In this report we found that aged animals had greater activity throughout the response period, but primarily during the onset of the response. This was most prominent at non-best directions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition is a primary mechanism for sharpening spatial tuning curves. We also noted that in aged animals the latency of the response was much shorter than in younger animals, which is consistent with a decrease in pre-onset inhibition. These results can be interpreted in the context of a failure of the timing and efficiency of feed-forward thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits in aged animals. Such a mechanism, if generalized across cortical areas, could play a major role in age-related cognitive decline.;"[Engle, James R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Engle, James R.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, ARL Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Davis";Recanzone, GH (corresponding author), Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ghrecanzone@ucdavis.edu;;;"NIA [R21AG024372, R01AG034137]; NIDCD [T32DC008072]; NIA NIH HHS [R21 AG024372, R01 AG034137] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCD NIH HHS [T32 DC008072] Funding Source: Medline";"NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))";The authors would like to thank Xochi Navarro and Dina Juarez-Salinas for their help with this project, and Rhonda Oates-O'Brien and Guy Martin for excellent animal care.

It uses established protocols to estimate the volume and number of neurons within the output nuclei (internal globus pallidus, IGP; and nondopaminergic substantia nigra, SNND), two internal relay and modulating nuclei (subthalamic nucleus, STh; and external globus pallidus, EGP), and a modulator of the striatum (dopaminergic substantia nigra, SND). Nuclear boundaries were defined by using immunohistochemistry for striatal afferents. Total numbers of Nissl-stained and parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were calculated by using the fractionator technique. Comparisons between species were standardized relative to brain mass (rats < marmosets < macaques < baboons < humans). The EGP consistently had more neurons relative to the IGP, STh, and SND, which had similar neuronal numbers within each species. The SNND had proportionally more neurons in rats than in primates (especially humans). The distribution of SND neurons varied substantially between rats and primates (very few ventrally located neurons in rats) with humans containing fewer SND neurons than other primates. The reduction in SND neurons in humans suggests less dopaminergic regulation of the basal ganglia system compared with other species. The consistency in the number of IGP neurons across all species, combined with the reduction in SNND neurons in humans, suggests a greater emphasis on output pathways through the IGP and that there are proportionally more STh and EGP neurons in humans.

Previous observations on the effect of ablation or inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) on the responses of neurons within the second somatosensory area(SII) to tactile stimuli point to profound differences between monkeys and certain other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems. In the cat, for example, tactile information appears to be conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII, whereas, in macaque and marmoset monkeys, it is conveyed in a serial (or hierarchical) scheme from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII. The present study examined the responses of individual SII neurons during reversible, cooling-induced inactivation of SI in another nonprimate placental mammal, the rabbit, to obtain further evidence on whether the above differences might reflect a fundamental distinction between simian primates and other mammalian species. 2. When the temperature at the face of a silver cooling block over the forepaw and hindpaw regions of SI was lowered to 5-13-degrees-C, the SI surface potentials evoked by brief tactile stimuli were abolished (indicative of SI inactivation), whereas SII potentials remained intact. 3. The responses of 25 SII neurons to controlled tactile stimuli (consisting of 1- to 1.5-s trains of vibration or rectangular mechanical pulses) were studied before, during, and after inactivation of SI. The effects on the spontaneous activity of a further three SII neurons that lacked identified receptive fields were also studied. 4. The response or activity levels of 26 of the 28 SII neurons examined (93%) were unaffected by SI inactivation. Furthermore, the temporal precision of responses at a particular phase of the repetitive mechanical stimuli also appeared to be unaffected by SI inactivation. The 28 neurons studied were located at different depths of the SII cortex and represented different functional classes, which included dynamically sensitive tactile neurons activated from glabrous or hairy skin by 5- to 10-Hz trains of mechanical stimuli and two neurons activated by high-frequency (300 Hz) cutaneous vibration, whose input appeared to come from pacinian corpuscles. 5. Only 2 of the 28 SII neurons exhibited a reduction in response to cutaneous stimuli during SI inactivation. However, because there was some evidence for a reduction in spontaneous activity in those neurons during SI inactivation, SI may exert a background facilitatory influence on the responsiveness of some SII neurons. 6. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that, in the rabbit, tactile information conveyed to SII is not dependent on an intracortical serially organized path through SI. Rather, the observations indicate that, in the rabbit, as in the cat, SI and SII are organized in parallel for the processing of information from the thalamus. These observations contrast with those in monkeys, where tactile processing is organized in a serial scheme, and support the hypothesis that there is a fundamental difference between simian primates and other mammals in the functional organization of thalamocortical tactile systems.;UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY 2033,AUSTRALIA;University of New South Wales Sydney;;;Murray, Grainne/AAK-1591-2021;"Murray, Grainne/0000-0003-0741-9288; Campbell, Douglas/0000-0001-9699-1854";;;;;29;28;28;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a number of modules, which seem to provide multiple subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical connections in subhuman primates. There may be a gnat degree of convergence of the limbic, associative and motor loops at the level of the striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic input directly as well as indirectly through the striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to behavioral learning by signaling motivation and reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be involved in behavioral state control, learning and reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections as well as the deep cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas, have very dense corticocotrical connections with other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents from the parietal and temporal cortices, and integrated information, via multiple routes, from the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi are linked directly to these areas by ways of the oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and the Ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), respectively. These connections are thought to be involved in the acquisition and coordination of motor sequences. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

As with a cable, spine neck resistance (Rneck) increases with increasing neck length and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the neck. A synaptic current entering a spine with a high Rneck will lead to greater local depolarization in the spine head than would a similar input applied to a spine with a lower Rneck. This could make spines with high Rneck more sensitive to plastic changes since voltage sensitive conductances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels can be more easily activated. This hypothesis was tested using serial section electron microscopic reconstructions of thalamocortical spine synapses and spine necks located on spiny stellate cells and corticothalamic cells from area 17 of cats. Thalamic axons and corticothalamic neurons were labeled by injections of the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized cats and spiny stellates were filled intracellularly in vivo with horseradish peroxidase. Twenty-eight labeled spines that formed synapses with dLGN boutons were collected from three spiny stellate and four corticothalamic cells and reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs. Spine length, spine diameter, and the area of the postsynaptic density were measured from the 3D reconstructions and Rneck of the spine was estimated. No correlation was found between the postsynaptic density size and the estimated spine Rneck. This suggests that forms of plasticity that lead to larger synapses are independent of spine neck resistance. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:20582066, 2013.

For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.;"[Najafian, Sohrab; Jin, Jianzhong; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;Najafian, Sharareh/0000-0001-6441-9693;National Institutes of Health [EY027361];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant EY027361.;;58;7;7;1;10;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Experiments were carried out on three awake macaque monkeys. Animals sat in a primate chair in front of a large screen, and fixated a small spot of light projected in different screen locations while the activity of single neurons was extracellularly recorded. Both visual and non-visual neurons were found. About 48% of visual and 32% of non-visual neurons showed eye position-related activity in total darkness, while in similar to 61% of visual neurons the visual response was modulated by eye position in the orbit. Eye position fields and/or gain fields were different from cell to cell, going from large and quite planar fields up to peak-shaped fields localized in more or less restricted regions of the animal's field of view, The spatial distribution of fixation point locations evoking peak activity in the eye position-sensitive population did not show any evident laterality effect, or significant top/bottom asymmetry. Moreover, the cortical distribution of eye position-sensitive neurons was quite uniform all over the cortical region studied, suggesting the absence of segregation for this property within area PO (V6). In the great majority of visual neurons, the receptive field 'moved' with gaze according to eye displacements, remaining at the same retinotopic coordinates, as is usual for visual neurons. In some cases, the receptive field did not move with gaze, remaining anchored to the same spatial location regardless of eye movements ('real-position cells'). A model is proposed suggesting how eye position-sensitive visual neurons might build up real-position cells in local networks within area PO (V6). The presence in area PO (V6) of real-position cells together with a high percentage of eye position-sensitive neurons, most of them visual in nature, suggests that this cortical area is engaged in the spatial encoding of extrapersonal visual space. Since lesions of the superior parietal lobule in humans produce deficits in visual localization of targets as well as in arm-reaching for them, and taking into account that the monkey's area PO (V6) is reported to be connected with the premotor area 6, we suggest that area PO (V6) supplies the premotor cortex with the visuo-spatial information required for the visual control of arm-reaching movements.;UNIV TRIESTE, IST FISIOL, TRIESTE, ITALY;University of Trieste;Galletti, C (corresponding author), UNIV BOLOGNA, IST FISIOL UMANA, CATTEDRA FISIOL GEN, PIAZZA PORTA S DONATO 2, I-40127 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;;Fattori, Patrizia/Q-8947-2017;"Fattori, Patrizia/0000-0002-0079-3755; Battaglini, Piero Paolo/0000-0003-4697-8648; GALLETTI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8927-3408";;;;;50;226;228;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Pain or temperature sensations can be evoked in humans by electrical stimulation in a vaguely defined region of the posterolateral thalamus(2,3). Here we use anterograde tracing and single unit recordings to demonstrate that there is a distinct nucleus in the posterior thalamus of the macaque monkey that receives a dense, topographic input from spinothalamic lamina I neurons and in which almost all neurons are nociceptive- or thermoreceptive-specific. Immunohistochemical staining showed that this nucleus is defined by a dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus in the macaque, so we applied the same staining method to sections of human thalamus. We found a nearly identical fibre plexus localized within a distinct nucleus that is cytoarchitectonically homologous to the lamina I relay nucleus in the macaque thalamus.

[I-125]iodoMLA bound throughout the brain with the greatest density in the thalamus and moderate intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical regions. The Kd and Bmax in whole brain tissue were similar whether 1 mM nicotine (Kd 33.25 +/- 15.17 nM, Bmax 5.80 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) or 2 mu M of the alpha 7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (Kd 46.12 +/- 18.45 nM, Bmax 6.30 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) was used for nonspecific binding. The subtype-selectivity of this ligand was further studied with competition binding studies using nicotine, alpha-bungarotoxin and noniodinated MLA. Each ligand completely inhibited [I-125]iodoMLA binding throughout the monkey brain, with Ki values of 2.23 +/- 0.85 mu M for nicotine, 2.72 +/- 1.71 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin and 1.83 +/- 0.35 nM MLA in the caudate and 2.03 +/- 1.14 mu M, 2.65 +/- 0.86 nM and 3.32 +/- 0.71 nM, respectively, in the putamen. The alpha 3 beta 2/alpha 6*-selective antagonist alpha-conotoxin MII failed to inhibit [I-125]iodoMLA binding in any brain region. In monkeys with cognitive deficits resulting from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration, [I-125]iodoMLA binding was significantly increased in the striatum, similar to results previously observed for [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, [I-125]iodoMLA was selective for alpha 7-containing nAChRs and did not bind to alpha 6-containing nAChRs.

To detail these interactions better, the present study used retrograde tracers to reveal the origins of the corticothalamic projections in two closely related monkey species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). The medial dorsal thalamic nucleus received only light cortical inputs, which predominantly arose from area 23. Efferents to the anterior medial thalamic nucleus also arose principally from area 23, but these projections proved more numerous than those to the medial dorsal nucleus and also involved additional inputs from areas 29 and 30. The anterior ventral and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei had similar sources of inputs from the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. For both nuclei, the densest projections arose from areas 29 and 30, with numbers of thalamic inputs often decreasing when going dorsal from area 23a to 23c and to area 31. In all cases, the corticothalamic projections almost always arose from the deepest cortical layer. The different profiles of inputs to the anterior medial and anterior ventral thalamic nuclei reinforce other anatomical and electrophysiological findings suggesting that these adjacent thalamic nuclei serve different, but complementary, functions supporting memory. While the lack of retrosplenial connections singled out the medial dorsal nucleus, the very similar connection patterns shown by the anterior ventral and laterodorsal nuclei point to common roles in cognition.;"[Aggleton, John P.; Wright, Nicholas F.; Vann, Seralynne D.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Saunders, Richard C.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;Aggleton@cf.ac.uk;"Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010; Wright, Nicholas/HHY-7227-2022; Wright, Nick G/O-1092-2013";"Wright, Nicholas/0000-0003-0798-333X; Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773; Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308";Wolfson Research Merit Award;Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society);This research received support from a Wolfson Research Merit Award.;;77;25;25;0;9;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Deposits of anterograde tracers were made in the two lateral-most subdivisions of the central complex, i.e., the middle part (or pars media) and the lateral part (or pars paralateralis). All injections avoided the pars parafascicularis. The intrastriatal distribution of labeled axonal endings was mapped in relation to the standard ventricular (CA-CP) system of coordinates. Labeled endings were observed in the major posterior and dorsal parts of the putamen (excluding its anteromedial and ventral parts) and also in a restricted ventrolateral part of the caudate nucleus. The topography of the central territory of the striatum, defined as the striatal space receiving axons from the central complex, was found to correspond exactly to that of the cortical sensorimotor territory delineated after cortical injections. The termination pattern of the central axons within the striatum was patchy. Viewed as a whole, the irregular and hazy patches formed oblique streaks, parallel one with the other. The three-dimensional reconstructions of data from transverse sections revealed that the streaks were bi-dimensional pictures of three-dimensional parasagittal layers covering the whole anteroposterior extent of the cortical sensorimotor territory of the striatum. Our work shows that the pars media of the central complex, which receives selectively pallidal afferent axons (Francois et al., '88: Brain Res. 473:181-186), is the main source of the centroputaminal projection.

This study aimed to investigate the cellular localization and distribution of TGF-beta 1, GDNF, and PDGF-BB in the CNS of adult rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Seven adult rhesus macaques were included in the study. The protein levels of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord were analyzed by western blotting. The expression and location of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the brain and spinal cord was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was detected by in situ hybridization. The molecular weight of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the homogenate of spinal cord was 25 KDa, 30 KDa, and 34 KDa, respectively. Immunolabeling revealed GDNF was ubiquitously distributed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, basal nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. TGF-beta 1 was least distributed and found only in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and PDGF-BB expression was also limited and present only in the brainstem and spinal cord. Besides, TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF were localized in the astrocytes and microglia of spinal cord and hippocampus, and their expression was mainly found in the cytoplasm and primary dendrites. The mRNA of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was localized to neuronal subpopulations in the spinal cord and cerebellum. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1, GDNF and PDGF-BB may be associated with neuronal survival, neural regeneration and functional recovery in the CNS of adult rhesus macaques, providing the potential insights into the development or refinement of therapies based on these factors.;"[Li, Hui; Mu, De-Zhi] Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Key Lab Birth Defects & Related Dis Women & Childr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Li, Hui] Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Intens Care Unit Gynecol & Obstet, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Dan, Qi-Qin; Chen, Yan-Jun; Chen, Li; Zhang, Hong-Tian; Wang, Ting-Hua] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Inst Neurol Dis, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China";"Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University";"Mu, DZ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Key Lab Birth Defects & Related Dis Women & Childr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Wang, TH (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Inst Neurol Dis, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.";"mudz@scu.edu.cn; Wangth_email@163.com";;Chen, Yan-Jun/0000-0002-1561-991X;;;;;108;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0364-3190;1573-6903;;NEUROCHEM RES;Neurochem.

This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.;"[Buckner, Randy L.; DiNicola, Lauren M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.; DiNicola, Lauren M.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";"Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA.";randy_buckner@harvard.edu;;Buckner, Randy/0000-0001-6422-8037;"US National Institutes of Health [P50MH106435]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE1745303]";"US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))";The authors thank J.

After intracortical microstimulation mapping of the forelimb area in the primary motor cortex of four macaque monkeys, a retrograde tracing study with fluorescent dyes was attempted to label simultaneously neurons in cortical and subcortical sites projecting to the distal forelimb representation area and those projecting to the proximal representation area of the primary motor cortex. Neurons projecting to distal and proximal forelimb parts of the primary motor cortex were largely separate in the following areas: the premotor area, primary somatosensory area, secondary somatosensory area, area 5, and thalamus. In contrast, there was no precise topographic organization of labeled projection neurons in the following areas: the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, primary motor cortex adjacent to the injection sites, claustrum, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The present study revealed that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives both segregated and intermixed inputs from cortical and subcortical sources. In particular, the fact that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives topographically organized inputs from the premotor area and nontopographically organized inputs from the supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area indicates possible different functional roles of frontal premotor areas in control of coordinated distal and proximal forelimb movements.;"NATL INST PHYSIOL SCI,OKAZAKI,AICHI 444,JAPAN; TOHOKU UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN";"National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Tohoku University";;;;;;;;;39;154;155;0;3;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] deoxyglucose to compare the brain metabolic responses ( marker of brain function) of cocaine-addicted subjects (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) to identify brain regions that are uniquely activated in addicted subjects by intravenous methylphenidate ( a drug that cocaine-addicted subjects report to be similar to cocaine). In parallel, we also measured the changes in dopamine (DA) induced by intravenous methylphenidate (using PET and [C-11] raclopride) in the striatum and in the thalamus. Metabolic responses between groups differed significantly only in the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 25 and medial BA 11], where methylphenidate increased metabolism in addicted subjects but decreased metabolism in controls. These changes were associated in all subjects with increased desire for methylphenidate and in the addicted subjects with cocaine craving. In addicted subjects, increases in BA 25 were also associated with mood elevation. Methylphenidate-induced increases in metabolism in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex were associated with its increase of DA in the thalamus but not in the striatum. These findings provide evidence that enhanced sensitivity of BA 25 (region involved with emotional reactivity) and BA 11 (region involved with salience attribution and motivation) in cocaine-addicted subjects may underlie the strong emotional response to the drug and the intense desire to procure it that results in craving and compulsive drug intake. It also suggests that the mesothalamic DA pathway may contribute to these processes.;"NIDA, Rockville, MD 20857 USA; NIAAA, Rockville, MD 20852 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Med, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Dept Chem, Upton, NY 11973 USA; Oregon Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Behav Sci, Portland, OR 97201 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Child Dev Ctr, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29465 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Oregon Health & Science University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Medical University of South Carolina";Volkow, ND (corresponding author), NIDA, 6001 Execut Blvd,Room 5274, Rockville, MD 20857 USA.;nvolkow@nida.nih.gov;;;NIDA NIH HHS [R01DA06891, R01 DA006891] Funding Source: Medline;NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA));;;72;237;243;0;14;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Throughout this so-called slow oscillation, cortical and thalamic neurons fluctuate between periods of intense synaptic activity (Up states) and almost complete silence (Down states). The two decades since the original characterization of the slow oscillation in the cortex and thalamus have seen considerable advances in deciphering the cellular and network mechanisms associated with this pervasive phenomenon. There are, nevertheless, many questions regarding the slow oscillation that await more thorough illumination, particularly the mechanisms by which Up states initiate and terminate, the functional role of the rhythmic activity cycles in unconscious or minimally conscious states, and the precise relation between Up states and the activated states associated with waking behavior. Given the substantial advances in multineuronal recording and imaging methods in both in vivo and in vitro preparations, the time is ripe to take stock of our current understanding of the slow oscillation and pave the way for future investigations of its mechanisms and functions. My aim in this Review is to provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms and functions of the slow oscillation, and to suggest avenues for further exploration.;"[Neske, Garrett T.] Brown Univ, Div Biol & Med, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Neske, Garrett T.] Yale Univ, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"Brown University; Yale University";Neske, GT (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Div Biol & Med, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;garrett_neske@brown.edu;;;"NIH [NS-050434]; Robin Chemers Neustein Graduate Fellowship in Brain Science - Brown Institute for Brain Science";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Robin Chemers Neustein Graduate Fellowship in Brain Science - Brown Institute for Brain Science";I thank Barry W.

In the present study we have combined electron microscopy with immunocytochemistry for the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) to assess the cholinergic synaptic organization of the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus in macaque monkeys. The cholinergic innervation of the MD nucleus showed striking regional variations with the greatest density of immunoreactive axons and varicosities found within the parvicellular division. Electron microscopic examination revealed that these ChAT immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) axons were primarily small and unmyelinated. The majority of immunoreactive synaptic profiles were found within the extraglomerular neuropil (80.5%), with the remainder present in glomerular regions. Within the glomerular and extra-glomerular neuropil ChAT-IR profiles made contact with both conventional, presumably relay cell dendrites (CD), as well as with synaptic vesicle containing dendrites (SVCD) of local circuit neurons. In the glomeruli the frequency of synapses was approximately equal for CDs and SVCDs while in the extraglomerular areas 75% of the synaptic contacts were with CDs. ChAT-IR synaptic profiles had a diversity of junctional complex morphologies. Within glomeruli they made symmetric synapses with CDs and predominantly asymmetric with SVCDs. The majority of extraglomerular contacts (60%) were classified as asymmetric and these as well as the smaller number of symmetric synapses contacted both CDs and SVCDs. In accord with results of physiological studies, these anatomical data indicate that cholinergic input to thalamic nuclei influences relay cell activity both directly and indirectly via local circuit neurons.;;;SCHWARTZ, ML (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,NEUROBIOL SECT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.;;;;"FIC NIH HHS [1-F05-TWO4606-01] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH44866-04] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS22807-06] Funding Source: Medline";"FIC NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;54;21;21;1;1;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

We selected the macaque monkey neocortex because of its clear areal subdivisions, large surface area, protracted development (gestation = 165 d), and similarity to the human brain. In situ hybridizations, performed at early [embryonic day 65 (E65)], middle (E80), and late (E95) stages of cortical development, revealed that EphA system family members are expressed in distinct gradients and laminar and areal domains in the embryonic neocortex. Indeed, several regionally restricted molecular patterns are already apparent within the cortical plate at E65, before the formation of thalamocortical connections, suggesting that the initial expression of some EphA system members is regulated by programs intrinsic to cortical cells. For example, EphA3, EphA6, and EphA7 are all selectively expressed within the presumptive visual cortex. However, although EphA6 and EphA7 are present throughout this region, EphA3 is only expressed in the prospective extrastriate cortex, suggesting that cortical cells harbor functional biases that may influence the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. Although several patterns of early gene expression are stable (e.g., EphA3, EphA4, and EphA6), others change as development proceeds (e.g., EphA5, EphA7, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5), perhaps responding to extrinsic cues. Thus, at E95, after connections between the cortical plate and thalamus have formed, receptor subtypes EphA3, EphA5, EphA6, and EphA7 and the ligand ephrin-A5 are expressed in posterior regions, whereas EphA4 and ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3 are either uniformly distributed or anteriorly biased. Taken together, our results demonstrate molecular distinctions among cells of the embryonic primate neocortex, revealing hitherto unrecognized compartmentalization early in corticogenesis.;Yale Univ, Sch Med, Neurobiol Sect, New Haven, CT 06510 USA;Yale University;Rakic, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Neurobiol Sect, 333 Cedar St,SHM-C303, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.;;;;;;;;84;102;106;0;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Although primates share many similarities in the organization of their visual centers with other mammals, and even other species of vertebrates, their visual pathways also show unique features, particularly with respect to the organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in order to understand some aspects of human visual function, we need to study non-human primate brains. Which species is the most appropriate model? Macaque monkeys, the most widely used non-human primates, are not an optimal choice in many practical respects. For example, much of the macaque cerebral cortex is buried within sulci, and is therefore inaccessible to many imaging techniques, and the postnatal development and lifespan of macaques are prohibitively long for many studies of brain maturation, plasticity, and aging. In these and several other respects the marmoset, a small New World monkey, represents a more appropriate choice. Here we review the visual pathways of the marmoset, highlighting recent work that brings these advantages into focus, and identify where additional work needs to be done to link marmoset brain organization to that of macaques and humans. We will argue that the marmoset monkey provides a good subject for studies of a complex visual system, which will likely allow an important bridge linking experiments in animal models to humans.;"[Solomon, Samuel G.] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, London WC1P 0AH, England; [Rosa, Marcello G.

To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.;"[Schwab, Bettina C.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurophysiol & Pathophysiol, Hamburg, Germany; [Schwab, Bettina C.] Univ Twente, Tech Med Ctr, Enschede, Netherlands; [Kase, Daisuke; Turner, Robert S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Kase, Daisuke; Rubin, Jonathan E.; Turner, Robert S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Zimnik, Andrew] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Rosenbaum, Robert] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Appl & Computat Math & Stat, South Bend, IN USA; [Codianni, Marcello G.; Rubin, Jonathan E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA USA";"University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Twente; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Columbia University; University of Notre Dame; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";"Turner, RS (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Turner, RS (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.";rturner@pitt.edu;"Turner, Robert S/A-9695-2008; Schwab, Bettina C./D-9126-2015";"Turner, Robert S/0000-0002-6074-4365; Schwab, Bettina C./0000-0003-1428-4836; Rubin, Jonathan/0000-0002-1513-1551; Rosenbaum, Robert/0000-0003-2105-9282; Kase, Daisuke/0000-0001-6787-5862";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health [R01NS091853, R01NS113817, R01NS070865]; NSF [DMS1516288, DMS1724240, DMS-1654268, Neuronex DBI-1707400]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [613.009.012]; Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN) [1P30NS076405-01A1]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN)";This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health grant numbers R01NS091853, R01NS113817 (to RST) and R01NS070865 (to RST and JER), NSF awards DMS1516288 and DMS1724240 (to JER), the Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN), 1P30NS076405-01A1, NSF awards DMS-1654268 and Neuronex DBI-1707400 (to RR), and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, NDNS+ grant 613.009.012).

We have previously shown that within the early weeks and months following one of these lesions, there is 1) a re-emergence of part or all of the cortical hand map; 2) central axonal sprouting of spared primary afferents into the dorsal horn and cuneate nucleus; and 3) substantial although incomplete recovery of hand function (Darian-Smith [2041 J.

And, does it contribute to the recovery of manual dexterity? To address these questions, the representation of the hand was electrophysiologically mapped (by unitary receptive field [RF] recordings) in the pars rotunda of the cuneate nucleus at either 1-2 weeks (short term) or 16-32 weeks (long term) post-rhizotomy. In short-term monkeys, the region deprived of input from the thumb, index, and middle finger was found to be unresponsive to cutaneous stimulation. However, at 16-32 weeks later, when dexterity had largely recovered, RFs of cuneate neurons could again be mapped within the cuneate nucleus, primarily in a region bordering the deprived zone.

In the developing animal brain, including those of non-human primates (NHPs), anaesthetics induce apoptotic cell death. We previously reported that a 5h isoflurane (ISO) exposure in infant NHPs increases apoptosis 13-fold compared with control animals. However, the majority of paediatric surgeries requiring anaesthesia are of shorter durations. We examined whether 3 h ISO exposure similarly increases neuroapoptosis in the NHP developing brain. Methods: Six-day-old NHP infants (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to 3h of a surgical plane of ISO (n = 6) or to room air (n = 5). Following exposure, NHP brains were screened for neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis using activated caspase-3 immunolabelling and unbiased stereology. Results: ISO treatment increased apoptosis (neurones + oligodendrocyte) to greater than four times that in the control group [mean density of apoptotic profiles: 57 (SD 22) mm(-3) vs 14 (SD 5.2) mm(-3), respectively]. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis was evenly distributed throughout the white matter whereas neuroapoptosis occurred primarily in the cortex (all regions), caudate, putamen and thalamus. Conclusions: A 3 h exposure to ISO is sufficient to induce widespread neurotoxicity in the developing primate brain.

A key parameter that the nervous system regulates is the level of force to exert against an object during tasks such as grasping. Previous studies indicate that the basal ganglia do not exhibit increased activity with increasing amplitude of force, although these conclusions are based mainly on the putamen. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which regions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex display increased activity when producing pinch-grip contractions of increasing force amplitude. We found that the internal portion of the globus pallidus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) had a positive increase in percent signal change with increasing force, whereas the external portion of the globus pallidus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, and caudate did not. In the thalamus we found that the ventral thalamic regions increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude. The contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor/somatosensory (M1/S1) cortices had a positive increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude, and the contralateral M1/S1 had a greater increase in percent signal change and activation volume than the ipsilateral side. We also found that deactivation did not change across force in the motor cortex and basal ganglia, but that the ipsilateral M1/S1 had greater deactivation than the contralateral M1/S1. Our findings provide direct evidence that GPi and STN regulate the amplitude of force output. These findings emphasize the heterogeneous role of individual nuclei of the basal ganglia in regulating specific parameters of motor output.;"Univ Illinois, Dept Movement Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Phys Therapy, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Neurol & Rehabil, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Rush Presbyterian St Lukes Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA";"University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Rush University";Vaillancourt, DE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Movement Sci, 1919 W Taylor St,650 AHSB,M-C 994, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;court1@uic.edu;Corcos, Daniel/AAX-9971-2021;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS052318, R01-NS-40902, R01-NS-52318, R01 NS028127, R01-NS-28127, R01 NS052318-03, R01 NS040902] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;57;89;90;0;11;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We find that, in the retina, alphaCamKII expression also differentiates two primary groups of ganglion cell, both characterized by broad, sparsely branching dendritic trees and cell bodies intermediate in size between the parvo- and magnocellular-projecting ganglion cells. Cells in the first group have three or four primary dendrites, a thick axon, and a rounded cell body and likely are made up of multiple types. In contrast, ganglion cells in the second group demonstrate a highly regular morphology, with strictly two primary dendrites and a thinner axon emanating from a smaller, elliptical cell body. This cell resembles the large sparse ganglion cell identified by others in retrograde labeling from the LGN and represents about 2% of all ganglion cells. In the optic nerve, alphaCamKII+ axons are also intermediate in size and form a bimodal distribution, correlating with the axonal sizes of the two groups of ganglion cell. For the LGN, we describe a group of aCamKII+ axon terminals with morphology consistent with terminals from retinal ganglion cells. These terminals form long, filamentous contacts with aCamKII+ relay cells and increase in frequency from the dorsal to the ventral koniocellular regions. Our results indicate that ganglion cells expressing aCamKII represent multiple projections to the brain, at least one of which provides input to one or more koniocellular regions of the LGN.

Furthermore, certain ventromedial cortical regions, namely the rhinal (i.e., entorhinal and perirhinal) cortex, are now known to be critical for visual recognition memory. Because the route taken by temporal cortical efferent fibers, especially perirhinar efferents, passes nearby the amygdala, it is possible that inadvertent damage to these fibers is produced by the aspirative but not the excitotoxic process, thereby accounting at least in part for the different behavioral outcomes of the two types of lesion. To test this idea, we assessed the integrity of the rhinal corticothalamic projection system after aspiration lesions of the amygdala. Three rhesus monkeys with unilateral amygdala removals received bilaterally symmetrical injections of a retrograde fluorescent tracer into the medial portion of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Retrogradely labeled cells were identified using conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques. In all three cases, the rhinal cortex of the intact hemispheres contained moderate numbers of retrogradely labeled cells. By contrast, the rhinal cortex of the amygdalectomized hemispheres consistently contained few retrogradely labeled cells, and a direct comparison of the two hemispheres showed this difference to be statistically significant. A similar asymmetric pattern was observed for area TE but not for the cortex lining the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, nor for the rostral cingulate motor area, which was examined as a control. The results indicate that aspiration lesions of the amygdala not only remove the cell bodies of the amygdala, as intended, but also inadvertently disrupt projection fibers arising from cells in the rhinal cortex and area TE that pass nearby or through the amygdala en route to the thalamus. Behavioral studies examining the effects of aspiration lesions of the amygdala in nonhuman primates need to take these findings into consideration.;"NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Laval, Ecole Psychol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Laval University";Murray, EA (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bldg 49,Room 1B80,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;eam@ln.nimh.nih.gov;Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019;Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642;;;;;53;43;43;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

In this study, the organization of these projections was defined in relation to architectonic areas within the OMPFC. All of the limbic structures were substantially connected with the following posterior and medial orbital areas: the posteromedial, medial, intermediate, and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm, Iam, Iai, and Ial, respectively) and areas 11m, 13a, 13b, 14c, and 14r. In contrast, lateral orbital areas 12o, 12m, and 12l and medial wall areas 24a,b and 32 were primarily connected with the amygdala, the temporal pole, and the cingulate cortex. Data were not obtained on the posteroventral medial wall. Three distinct projections were recognized from the basal amygdaloid nucleus: 1) The dorsal part projected to area 121; 2) the ventromedial part projected to most areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex except for areas Iai, 12o, 13a, and 14c; and 3) the ventrolateral part projected to orbital areas 120, Iai, 13a, 14c, and to the medial wall areas. The accessory basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei projected most strongly to areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex. The medial, anterior cortical, and central amygdaloid nuclei and the periamygdaloid cortex were connected with the posterior orbital areas. The projection from the hippocampus originated from the rostral subiculum and terminated in the medial orbital areas. The same region was reciprocally connected with the anteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, which received input from the rostral subiculum. The parahippocampal cortical areas (including the temporal polar, entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices) were primarily connected with posterior and medial orbital areas, with some projections to the dorsal part of the medial wall. The rostral cingulate cortex sent fibers to the medial wall, to the medial orbital areas, and to lateral areas 12o, 12r, and Iai. The posterior cingulate gyrus, including the caudomedial lobule, was especially strongly connected with area 11m.

Neuronal cell tropisms and infection patterns are viable options for obtaining viral vector-mediated transgene delivery that is selective for particular neuronal pathways. For example, several types of viral vectors can infect axon terminals (retrograde infections), which enables targeted transgene delivery to neurons that directly project to a particular viral injection region. Although recent studies in rodents have demonstrated that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) and 9 (AAV9) efficiently transduce neurons, the tropisms and infection patterns remain poorly understood in primate brains. Here, we constructed recombinant AAV8 or AAV9, which expressed an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene driven by a ubiquitous promoter (AAV8-EGFP and AAV9-EGFP, respectively), and stereotaxically injected it into several brain regions in marmosets and macaque monkeys. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed almost exclusive colocalization of EGFP fluorescence via AAV9-mediated gene transfer with a neuron-specific marker, indicating endogenous neuronal tropism of AAV9, which was consistent with our previous results utilizing AAV8. Injections of either AAV8-EGFP or AAV9-EGFP into the marmoset striatum resulted in EGFP expression in local striatal neurons as a result of local infection, as well as expression in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra via retrograde transport along nigrostriatal axonal projections. Retrograde infections were also observed in the frontal cortex and thalamus, which are known to have direct projections to the striatum. These local and retrograde gene transfers were further demonstrated in the geniculocortical pathway of the marmoset visual system. These findings indicate promising capabilities of AAV8 and AAV9 to deliver molecular tools into a range of primate neural systems in pathway-specific manners through their neuronal tropisms and infection patterns.

At 3 days after rabies injections into proximal forelimb, distal forelimb and hindlimb representations of the macaque MI, second-order neurons via the thalamus were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei, including the dentate (DN), anterior interpositus (AIN) and posterior interpositus nuclei. In the DN, the labeling of both the forelimb and hindlimb was seen mainly in the dorsal aspect. The labeling of the hindlimb was located rostral to that of the forelimb and the labeling of the proximal forelimb was located slightly rostral to that of the distal forelimb. The same rostrocaudal arrangement was observed in the AIN. In the posterior interpositus nucleus, however, labeling from the MI hindlimb and forelimb representations largely overlapped. At the 4-day postinjection period, third-order labeling occurred in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar hemisphere. The Purkinje cell labeling from the forelimb representation, including the proximal and distal regions, was observed primarily in lobules IV-VI and crus I. The proximal forelimb labeling was both rostral and lateral to that of the distal forelimb within lobules IV-VI. However, the hindlimb labeling was seen both rostral and lateral to that of the proximal forelimb within lobules III-VI. These results indicate that the hindlimb, proximal forelimb and distal forelimb are arranged rostrocaudally in the DN and AIN, whereas there is dual somatotopy along the rostrocaudal and lateromedial axes in the cerebellar cortex.;"Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Behav & Brain Sci, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Syst Neurophysiol, Okazaki, Aichi 444, Japan";"Juntendo University; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Kyoto University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)";Lu, XF (corresponding author), Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, 2-1-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.;riku@med.juntendo.ac.jp;;Nambu, Atsushi/0000-0003-2153-5445;;;;;41;55;58;1;15;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Less understood are the fidelity of entrainment to each stimulus pulse, whether entrainment patterns are stationary over time, and how responses differ among DBS targets. In this study, three rhesus macaques were implanted with a single DBS lead in VPLo, STN, or GP. Single-unit spike activity was recorded in the resting state in motor cortex during VPLo DBS, in GP during STN DBS, and in STN and pallidal-receiving area of motor thalamus (VLo) during GP DBS. VPLo DBS induced time-locked spike activity in 25% (n = 15/61) of motor cortex cells, with entrained cells following 7.5 +/- 7.4% of delivered pulses. STN DBS entrained spike activity in 26% (n = 8/27) of GP cells, which yielded time-locked spike activity for 8.7 +/- 8.4% of stimulus pulses. GP DBS entrained 67% (n = 14/21) of STN cells and 32% (n = 19/59) of VLo cells, which showed a higher fraction of pulses effectively inhibiting spike activity (82.0 +/- 9.6% and 86.1 +/- 16.6%, respectively). Latency of phase-locked spike activity increased over time in motor cortex (58%, VPLo DBS) and to a lesser extent in GP (25%, STN DBS). In contrast, the initial inhibitory phase observed in VLo and STN during GP DBS remained stable following stimulation onset. Together, these data suggest that circuit-level entrainment is low-pass filtered during high-frequency stimulation, most notably for glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, phase entrainment is not stationary or consistent at the circuit level for all DBS targets.;"[Agnesi, Filippo; Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Muralidharan, Abirami; Baker, Kenneth B.; Vitek, Jerrold L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, 7-105 NHH,312 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;john5101@umn.edu;;Baker, Kenneth/0000-0002-4435-7015;"National Institutes of Health [NS-081118, NS-037019, NS077657]; Michael J.

Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative image analysis was used to measure mRNAs coding for CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and thalamic center median-subfascicular complex (CM-Sf). Then, CRH neurons in the PVN were immunostained and the area of immunostaining was measured. Also, CRH fibers were immunostained in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the area of immunostaining was obtained. Finally, POMC mRNA expression was characterized in the hypothalamic infundibular nucleus. The groups were compared with ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keul's (SNK) post hoc comparison. Results: CRH mRNA was significantly elevated in the caudal PVN in the MSR and SS animals compared to HSR animals (p < 0.05, SNK). There was a significant increase in average and total CRH-positive area in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). There was also a significant increase in CRH volume in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the CM-Sf, the average CRH optical density was significantly higher in the MSR and SS groups than in the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the central nucleus of the amygdala, the area of CRH fiber staining was significantly higher in the SS group than in the MSR or HSR groups (p < 0.05, SNK). There was no difference between the groups in POMC mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Conclusion: Macaques that exhibit immediate suppression of reproductive function upon stress are considered stress sensitive. These animals have elevated CRH in the hypothalamus and limbic structures, which may play a role in suppressing the hypothalamic-gonadal axis upon stress initiation. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

Much of the work on animal foraging has focused on factors relating to the amount of time and energy animals expend searching for and harvesting foods. Models that emphasize such factors have been invaluable in determining when it is beneficial for an animal to search for pastures new. When foraging, however, animals also have to determine how to direct their search. For what food should they forage? There is no point searching for more of a particular food when you are sated from eating it. Here we review work in macaques and humans that has sought to reveal the neural circuits critical for determining the subjective value of different foods and associated objects in our environment and tracking this value over time. There is mounting evidence that a network composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and medial thalamus is critical for linking objects in the environment with food value and adjusting those valuations in real time based on current biological needs. Studies using temporary inactivation methods have revealed that the amygdala and OFC play distinct yet complementary roles in this valuation process. Such a network for determining the subjective value of different foods and, by extension, associated objects, must interact with systems that determine where and for how long to forage. Only by efficiently incorporating these two factors into their decisions will animals be able to achieve maximal fitness.;"[Murray, Elisabeth A.; Rudebeck, Peter H.] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Learning & Memory, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Murray, EA (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bldg 49,Suite 1B80,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;murraye@mail.nih.gov;"Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019; Rudebeck, Peter H/G-7931-2012";"Rudebeck, Peter/0000-0002-1411-7555; Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642";Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health;Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.

Rapid adaptation in behavior has been attributed to frontal cortical circuits, but it is not clear if sensory cortexes also play an essential role in such tasks. In this study we tested whether the auditory cortex was necessary for rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds. We used a two-alternative choice sound-categorization task for rats in which the boundary that separated two acoustic categories changed several times within a behavioral session. These shifts in the boundary resulted in changes in the rewarded action for a subset of stimuli. We found that extensive lesions of the auditory cortex did not impair the ability of rats to switch between categorization contingencies and sound discrimination performance was minimally impaired. Similar results were obtained after reversible inactivation of the auditory cortex with muscimol. In contrast, lesions of the auditory thalamus largely impaired discrimination performance and, as a result, the ability to modify behavior across contingencies. Thalamic lesions did not impair performance of a visual discrimination task, indicating that the effects were specific to audition and not to motor preparation or execution. These results suggest that subcortical outputs of the auditory thalamus can mediate rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds.;"[Gimenez, Tyler L.; Jaramillo, Santiago] Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Gimenez, Tyler L.; Jaramillo, Santiago] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lorenc, Maja] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA";"University of Oregon; University of Oregon; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory";Jaramillo, S (corresponding author), 1254 Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;sjara@uoregon.edu;;"Jaramillo, Santiago/0000-0002-6595-8450; Lorenc, Maja/0000-0003-2665-0135";"Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon; Medical Research Foundation";"Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon; Medical Research Foundation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";This work was supported by the Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon and a grant from the Medical Research Foundation.;;51;21;21;1;11;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Its extent depends on the age of the monkey at operation, post-operative survival, species and retinal eccentricity. Some studies of human patients with occipital lobe injury have found no evidence transneuronal retrograde degeneration, suggesting that either degeneration may not occur or, if present, it is caused directly by secondary damage impinging upon the underlying white matter or the blood supply to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and optic tract. We therefore studied retinal ganglion cell degeneration in three macaques in which only the striate cortex corresponding: to the macular retina had been removed, thereby sparing extrastriate colter and precluding interruption of the vascular supply to the thalamus and optic tract. There was extensive loss of ganglion cells in the central retina, corresponding to the central 10 degrees of vision. As the cortical lesion was too small to affect the thalamus or optic tract directly, the retinal degeneration must he transneuronal.

Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of blindsight' observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.;"[Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Vidyasagar, Trichur R.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Vidyasagar, Trichur R.] Univ Melbourne, Vis Sci & Melbourne Brain Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Bosch Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";"University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Sydney; University of Sydney";Jayakumar, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.;trv@unimelb.edu.au;"Vidyasagar, Trichur/D-9665-2012; Jayakumar, Jaikishan/G-4675-2012";"Vidyasagar, Trichur/0000-0002-4148-2048; Jayakumar, Jaikishan/0000-0001-8925-723X";National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [509254, APP1004102];National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia);Dr J Jayakumar and some of our experiments reviewed in this article were supported by project grants 509254 and APP1004102 from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.;;94;9;9;0;16;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0816-4622;;;CLIN EXP OPTOM;Clin.

Yet, while electrophysiological correlates suggest that FO is generated within intracortical networks, contributions of subcortical structures along the trigeminal pathway remain uncertain. Using surface and laminar electrode arrays, in vivo recordings of vibrissal and electrically evoked FO were made within somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rodents before and after ablation of the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) or during reversible cortical cooling. In VB-lesioned animals, vibrissal stimulation failed to evoke FO, while epicortical stimulation in lesioned animals remained effective in generating FO. In nonlesioned animals, cortical cooling eliminated vibrissal-evoked FO despite the persistence of thalamocortical input. Vibrissal-evoked FO returned with the return to physiological temperatures. Results from this study indicate that somatosensory cortex alone is able to initiate and sustain FO. Moreover, these data suggest that cortical network interactions are solely responsible for the generation of FO, while synchronized thalamocortical input serves as the afferent trigger.;Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA;"University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder";Barth, DS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Campus Box 345, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;;Staba, Richard/AAN-3149-2021;;NINDS NIH HHS [2 R01 NS-36981] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;42;15;15;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MTC were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIP; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MTC to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MTC had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MTC to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups.

It is therefore surprising that this ability is impaired by medial temporal lobe (MTL) resections, because such lesions spare working memory in other sensory modalities. To determine whether MTL ablations might have caused the auditory deficit through inadvertent transection of superior temporal gyrus (STG) projections to its downstream targets, and, if so, which targets might have been compromised, we injected anterograde tracer (biotinylated dextran amine) in the STG of both the normal and MTL-lesioned hemispheres of split-brain monkeys. Interhemispheric comparison of label failed to show any effect of the MTL ablation on efferents from caudal STG, which projects to the inferior prefrontal convexity. However, the ablation did consistently interrupt the normally dense projections from rostral STG to both the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and medial thalamic nuclei. The findings support the possibility that the auditory working memory deficit after MTL ablation is due to transection of downstream auditory projections, and indicate that the candidate structures for mediating auditory working memory are the ventral medial prefrontal cortical areas, the medial thalamus, or both.;"[Munoz, Monica; Mishkin, Mortimer; Saunders, Richard C.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Munoz, M (corresponding author), Inst Child Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England.;monica.munoz@ich.ucl.ac.uk;"Munoz, Monica/C-9189-2009; Munoz-Lopez, Monica/F-3154-2016";Munoz-Lopez, Monica/0000-0002-5530-2394;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));Funding for this article and for the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.;;55;19;19;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

In the present study, we report that the expression of occ1 mRNA in the macaque neocortex can be classified into two modes. The first mode is associated with excitatory neurons distributed in the major thalamocortical recipient layers that exhibit strong cytochrome oxidase activity. This is highly prominent in V1. The second mode is associated with parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and is distributed across the macaque neocortex, In V1, monocular deprivation showed that occ1 mRNA expression in excitatory neurons was markedly dependent on afferent activity, whereas that in GABAergic interneurons was not. Cross-species comparison showed specific differences in expression. In marmosets, a strong expression was observed in V1 similarly to macaques. The occ1 mRNA expression, however, was generally weak in the mouse neocortex. In rabbit and ferret cortices, the strong expression was observed only in GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that activity-dependent occ1 mRNA expression in the excitatory neurons of V1 was caused by a novel mechanism acquired by primates after their separation from other lineages.;"Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan";"National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan";Yamamori, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.;yamamori@nibb.ac.jp;Yamamori, Tetsuo/N-6536-2015;"Yamamori, Tetsuo/0000-0001-5016-0078; Tochitani, Shiro/0000-0001-5765-3668";;;;;92;28;29;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

It is considered to be a major component of the limbic system and has been shown to subserve a wide range of autonomic and somatic motor functions. The anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate cortex can be differentiated according to their thalamic afferents as well as their patterns of corticocortical connectivity. The primate cingulate cortex is traditionally divided into a series of cytoarchitectonic zones that can be distinguished along a ventral-dorsal axis of differentiation in both the anterior (areas 25, 24a, 24b, and 24c), and posterior (areas 29, 30, 23a, 23b, and 23c) regions. However, little is known about the precise cellular organization of these subareas. In the present study, we attempt to define the neuronal morphological and biochemical composition of the different cingulate cortex subareas, using antibodies to the neurofilament triplet protein and calcium-binding proteins. Results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the structure and functions of the cingulate cortex and the immunostaining patterns. For instance, distribution of neurofilament-rich pyramidal neurons parallels that of specific corticocortical and corticosubcortical systems and is a useful marker to delineate the cingulate motor area. Calcium-binding protein-containing neurons display a high degree of regional and laminar specialization. In particular, parvalbumin-positive interneurons are codistributed with neurofilament-immunoreactive pyramidal cells along the ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal axes of the cingulate cortex. Calbindin- and calretinin-positive immunostaining show more monotonous laminar and regional patterns, although they exhibit a particular labeling in area 29 that may correspond to the termination of select thalamocortical afferents. These chemoarchitectural patterns of regional and laminar neuronal specialization may be envisioned as the reflection of the richness of cortical diversity in the cingulate gyrus, and make it an ideal place to explore the interplay of the distributions of various neuron types in cortical areas of known function.;"CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA";"City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai";;;Nimchinsky, Esther/GXF-5277-2022;;;;;;74;79;79;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Toes 1, 3, and 5 were missing, but the proximal parts of toes 2 and 4 were present. We used anatomical tracers to characterize the patterns of peripheral input to the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as between thalamus and cortex. We also determined the somatotopic organization of primary somatosensory area 3b of both hemispheres using multiunit electrophysiological recording. Tracers were subcutaneously injected into matching locations of each foot to reveal their representations within the lumbar spinal cord, and the gracile nucleus (GrN) of the brainstem. Tracers injected into the representations of the toes and plantar pads of cortical area 3b labeled neurons in the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Contrary to the orderly arrangement of the foot representation throughout the lemniscal pathway in the normal monkey, the plantar representation of the deformed foot was significantly expanded and intruded into the expected representations of toes in the spinal cord, GrN, VPL, and area 3b. We also observed abnormal representation of the intact foot in the ipsilateral spinal cord and contralateral area 3b. Thus, congenital malformation influences the somatotopic representation of the deformed as well as the intact foot.;"[Liao, Chia-Chi; Qi, Hui-Xin; Reed, Jamie L.; Miller, Daniel J.; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37212 USA";Vanderbilt University;Liao, CC (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.;chia-chi.liao@vanderbilt.edu;Qi, Huixin/IVH-7095-2023;Qi, Huixin/0000-0003-0265-9194;National Institutes of Health [NS16446, NS067017];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This study is supported by National Institutes of Health Grant NS16446 to Jon H.

A fundamental question is thus how the brain integrates the separate elements of an object defined by several sensory components to form a unified percept. The superior colliculus was the main model for studying multisensory integration. At the cortical level, until recently, multisensory integration appeared to be a characteristic attributed to high-level association regions. First, we describe recently observed direct cortico-cortical connections between different sensory cortical areas in the non-human primate and discuss the potential role of these connections. Then, we show that the projections between different sensory and motor cortical areas and the thalamus enabled us to highlight the existence of thalamic nuclei that, by their connections, may represent an alternative pathway for information transfer between different sensory and/or motor cortical areas. The thalamus is in position to allow a faster transfer and even an integration of information across modalities. Finally, we discuss the role of these non-specific connections regarding behavioral evidence in the monkey and recent electrophysiological evidence in the primary cortical sensory areas.

The main thalamic projections, which originated in both the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, were topographically organized. Our results suggest the existence of a third, caudal subdivision of this nucleus, which is likely to be homologous to the macaque's pars densocellularis. A substantial, but not topographically organized, projection to Brodmann's area 10 originated in the medial part of the ventral anterior nucleus. Minor thalamic projections originated in the medial pulvinar nucleus and in the midline/intralaminar nuclei. Finally, the posterior thalamic group (including the limitans and suprageniculate nuclei) sent a small projection to rostral area 10 that has not previously been documented in primates. The main extrathalamic projections stemmed from the claustrum, which contained as many as 50% of all subcortical labelled neurons. Minor connections originated in the hypothalamus (mainly in the lateral anterior and lateral tuberal regions), dorsal periaqueductal grey matter, basal forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert and horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca), and amygdala (basal, accessory basal and lateral nuclei). The present results, combined with recent data on the cortical projections to area 10, reveal the frontal pole as a region that integrates information from multiple neural processing systems, including high-level sensory, limbic and working memory-related structures. Although the pattern of subcortical projections is similar to that previously described in the macaque, suggesting a homologous organization, the present data also suggest functional distinctions between medial and lateral sectors of area 10.;"[Burman, Kathleen J.; Reser, David H.; Richardson, Karyn E.; Gaulke, Heidi; Worthy, Katrina H.; Rosa, Marcello G.

Restricted areas of the lateral and posterior orbital cortex had specific connections with visual-, somatosensory-, olfactory-, gustatory-, and visceral-related structures. More medial areas received few direct sensory inputs. Within the lateral and posterior orbital cortex, area 12l received a substantial projection from visual areas in the inferior temporal cortex (TE). Area 12m received somatosensory input from face, digit, or forelimb regions in the opercular part of area 1-2, in area 7b, in the second somatosensory area (SII), and in the anterior infraparietal area (AIP). Areas 13m and 13l also received a projection from the opercular part of areas 1-2 and 3b. The posteromedial and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm and Ial, respectively) received fibers from the ventral part of the parvicellular division of the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) that may represent a visceral afferent system. The dorsal part of VPMpc projected to the adjacent gustatory cortex. These restricted inputs from several sensory modalities and the convergent corticocortical connections to orbital areas 13l and 13m suggest a network related to feeding. The OMPFC was also connected to premotor cortex in ventral area 6 (areas 6va and 6vb), in cingulate area 24c, and probably in the supplementary eye field. Area 6va projected to area 12m, whereas a region of area 6vb projected to area 13l. The region of the supplementary eye field projected to areas 12l, 12o, and 12r. Area Ial received fibers from area 24c. Lighter and more diffuse projections also reached wider areas of the OMPFC. For example, injections in several orbital areas labeled a few cells scattered through the anterior part of area TE and the superior temporal gyrus. There was also a projection to the intermediate agranular insular area (Iai) and to areas 13a and 12o from the apparently multimodal areas in the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus.

The modularity is best seen in tangential sections, with double-labeling immunohistochemistry to reveal overlapping or complementary relationships of different markers. The pattern is overall like a reticulum or mosaic but is described as a honeycomb, in which the walls and hollows are composed of distinct afferent and dendritic systems. We demonstrate the main components of the honeycomb in rat visual cortex. These are as follows: (1) zinc-enriched, corticocortical terminations in the walls, and in the hollows, thalamocortical terminations (labeled by antibody against vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and by cytochrome oxidase); (2) parvalbumin-dense neuropil in the walls that partly colocalizes with elevated levels of glutamate receptors 2/3, NMDAR receptor 1, and calbindin; and (3) dendritic subpopulations preferentially situated within the walls (dendrites of layer 2 neurons) or hollows (dendrites of deeper neurons in layers 3 and 5). Because the micromodularity is restricted to layers 2 and 1b, without extending into layer 3, this may be another indication of a laminar-specific substructure at different spatial scales within cortical columns. The suggestion is that corticocortical and thalamocortical terminations constitute parallel circuits at the level of layer 2, where they are segregated in association with distinct dendritic systems. Results from parvalbumin staining show that the honeycomb mosaic is not limited to rat visual cortex but can be recognized at the layer 1-2 border in other areas and species.";"RIKEN, Lab Cort Organizat Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Dept Morphol Brain Sci, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto 6068501, Japan";"RIKEN; Kyoto University";Ichinohe, N (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Organizat Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;nichinohe@brain.riken.go.jp;;"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785; Fujiyama, Fumino/0000-0001-9619-8928";;;;;74;49;49;1;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

As a consequence, human brain imaging studies have focused on its role in the sensory perception of emotions. However, evidence from neurophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that the insula is also involved in generating emotional and communicative facial expressions. In particular, a recent study demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the mid-ventral sector of the insula evoked affiliative facial expressions. The present study aimed to describe the cortical connections of this affiliative field. To this aim, we identified the region with electrical stimulation and injected neural tracers to label incoming and outgoing projections. Our results show that the insular field underlying emotional expression is part of a network involving specific frontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal areas, as well as the amygdala, the basal ganglia, and thalamus, indicating that this sector of the insula is a site of integration of motor, emotional, sensory and social information. Together with our previous functional studies, this result challenges the classic view of the insula as a multisensory area merely reflecting bodily and internal visceral states. In contrast, it supports an alternative perspective: that the emotional responses classically attributed to the insular cortex are endowed with an enactive component intrinsic to each social and emotional behavior.;"[Jezzini, Ahmad] Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Rozzi, Stefano; Borra, Elena; Gallese, Vittorio; Caruana, Fausto; Gerbella, Marzio] Univ Parma, Dept Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Caruana, Fausto] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Brain Ctr Social & Motor Cognit, I-43125 Parma, Italy";"Washington University (WUSTL); University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT";Jezzini, A (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Campus Box 8108,660 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;"ahmadmjezzini@gmail.com; fausto.caruana@unipr.it";"Gallese, Vittorio/ABD-5097-2021; Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Jezzini, Ahmad/S-2289-2018; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; Caruana, Fausto/J-5274-2018";"Gallese, Vittorio/0000-0003-4815-3607; Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Jezzini, Ahmad/0000-0003-2380-7336; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Caruana, Fausto/0000-0002-4631-7543";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005]; European Commission Grant Cogsystems [FP7-250013]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]; RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission Grant Cogsystems; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT";This work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (grant number: PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005), European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013, Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11, and RTM, la rete tecnologica multidisciplinare di IIT.

Evidence for more direct sensorimotor links is now presented to show that cerebral cortex rarely, if ever, receives messages representing receptor activity only; thalamic inputs to cortex also carry copies of current motor instructions. Pathways afferent to the thalamus represent the primary input to neocortex. Generally they are made up of branching axons that send one branch to the thalamus and another to output centers of the brain stem or spinal cord. The information transmitted through the classical sensory pathways to the thalamus represents not only information about the environment and the body, but also about instructions currently on their way to motor centers. The proposed hierarchy of direct corticocortical connections of the sensory pathways is not the only possible hierarchy of cortical connections. There is also a hierarchy of the corticofugal pathways to motor centers in the midbrain, and there are transthalamic corticocortical pathways that may show a comparable hierarchy. The extent to which these hierarchies may match each other, and relate to early developmental changes are poorly defined at present, but are important for understanding mechanisms that can link action and perception in the developing brain.";Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA;"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Guillery, RW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, 1300 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;rguiller@wisc.edu;;;;;;;120;33;35;1;13;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-51679-4;PROG BRAIN RES;Prog.

Sprouting of cortical axons cannot account for the extent of reorganization, and withdrawal of axons of deafferented brainstem and thalamic neurons, permitting expression of previously silent synapses, has not been directly demonstrated. This study is focused on the second of these. In monkeys, deafferented for two years by section of the cuneate fasciculus at the C1 level, there was extensive withdrawal of axon terminals from thalamus and cortex, detectable a decade before visible atrophy of their parent neuronal somata in the cuneate nucleus or thalamus. Slow, inexorable progression of lemniscal and thalamocortical axonal withdrawal is a neurodegenerative phenomenon likely to be a powerful inducement to compensatory long-term plasticity, a mechanism that can explain the long-term evolution of cortical reorganization and, with it, phantom sensations in spinal patients and amputees.;"[Graziano, Alessandro; Jones, Edward G.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis";Jones, EG (corresponding author), 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [NS 21377]; United States Public Health Service; University of California";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Public Health Service(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service); University of California(University of California System)";This work was supported by Grant NS 21377 from the National Institutes of Health, United States Public Health Service, and by the University of California, Davis, W.

An anterograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline thalamus revealed strong projections to the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus. Retrograde tracer injections into these areas labeled neurons specifically in Pa. Following a retrograde tracer injection into Pa, labeled neurons were found in the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and periaqueductal gray. Pa contained a remarkably high density of axons and axonal varicosities immunoreactive for serotonin (5-HT) and orexin/hypocretin (ORX), as well as a moderate density of fibers immunoreactive for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). A retrograde tracer injection into Pa combined with immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ORX and 5-HT axons originate from neurons in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Pa-projecting neurons were localized in the same nuclei of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain as CRH neurons, although no double labeling was found. The connections of Pa and its innervation by 5-HT, ORX, and CRH suggest that it may relay stress signals between the midbrain and hypothalamus with the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, and subgenual cortex as part of a circuit that manages stress and possibly stress-related psychopathologies.

The effort of many neuroanatomists over the past has revealed the general outline of these connections; however, their function remains a mystery. Recently, combined physiological and anatomical approaches are beginning to reveal the role of these connections in the generation of cortical receptive fields. A common theme emerges from all these studies: cortical connections are remarkably specific and this specificity is determined in great extent by the type of connection and the neuronal response properties. Feedforward connections follow relatively rigid rules of wiring selectively targeting neurons with receptive fields matched in position and contrast polarity (thalamus --> cortical layer 4) or position and orientation selectivity (layer 4 --> layers 2 + 3). In contrast, horizontal connections follow more flexible rules connecting distant cells that are not retinotopically aligned and neighboring cells with different orientation preferences. These differences in connectivity may give a hint on how visual stimuli are processed in the primary visual cortex. An attractive hypothesis is that local stimuli use the highly selective feedforward inputs to reliably drive cortical neurons while background stimuli modulate their activity through more flexible horizontal (and feedback) connections.";Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA;University of Connecticut;;alonso@uconnvm.uconn.edu;;;;;;;129;23;23;0;11;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1073-8584;1089-4098;;NEUROSCIENTIST;Neuroscientist;OCT;2002;8;5;;;;;443;456;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107385802236967;;;14;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;598CA;12374429;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000178256500017;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study provides the first causal evidence that RSC in macaque monkeys is crucial for postoperative retention of preoperatively and postoperatively acquired memories. Preoperatively, monkeys learned 300 object-in-place scene discriminations across sessions. After RSC removal, one-trial postoperative retention tests revealed significant retrograde memory loss for these 300 discriminations relative to unoperated control monkeys. Less robust evidence was found for a deficit in anterograde memory (new postoperative learning) after RSC lesions as new learning to criterion measures failed to reveal any significant learning impairment. However, after achieving a parts per thousand yen90% learning criterion for the postoperatively presented novel 100 object-in-place scene discriminations, short-term retention (i.e., measured after 24 h delay) of this well-learnt set was impaired in the RSC monkeys relative to controls. A further experiment assessed rapid within session acquisition of novel object-in-place scene discriminations, again confirming that new learning per se was unimpaired by bilateral RSC removal.

Individual areas are distinguished on the basis of unique profiles comprising architectonic features, thalamic and cortical connections, and neuron response properties. Recent demonstrations of convergent auditory-somatosensory interactions in the caudomedial (CM) and caudolateral (CL) belt areas prompted us to pursue anatomical studies to identify the source(s) of somatic input to auditory cortex. Corticocortical and thalamocortical connections were revealed by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into CM, CL, and adjoining fields of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and macaque (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. In addition to auditory cortex, the cortical connections of CM and CL included somatosensory (retroinsular, Ri; granular insula, Ig) and multisensory areas (temporal parietal occipital, temporal parietal temporal). Thalamic inputs included the medial geniculate complex and several multisensory nuclei (supra-geniculate, posterior, limitans, medial pulvinar), but not the ventroposterior complex. Injections of the core (Al, R) and rostromedial areas of auditory cortex revealed sparse multisensory connections. The results suggest that areas Ri and Ig are the principle sources of somatosensory input to the caudal belt, while multisensory regions of cortex and thalamus may also contribute. The present data add to growing evidence of multisensory convergence in cortical areas previously considered to be 'unimodal', and also indicate that auditory cortical areas differ in this respect.";"[Hackett, Troy A.; de la Mothe, Lisa A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Smiley, John F.; Lakatos, Peter; Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Ulbert, Istvan; Karmos, George; Lakatos, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, H-1394 Budapest, Hungary; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Columbia University";Hackett, TA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;troy.a.hackett@vanderbilt.edu;Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010;Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021;;;;;96;73;73;0;5;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0301-0066;1468-4233;;PERCEPTION;Perception;;2007;36;10;;;;;1419;1430;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5841;;;12;"Ophthalmology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)";"Ophthalmology; Psychology";254LN;18265825;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000252588200002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Because of the complexity of the connection data, analysis is required to unravel what principles of organization they imply. To date, analysis of laminar origin and termation connection data to reveal hierarchical relationships between the cortical areas has been the most widely acknowledged approach. We programmed a network processor that searches for optimal hierarchical orderings of cortical areas given known hierarchical constraints and rules for their interpretation. For all cortical systems and all cost functions, the processor found a multitude of equally low-cost hierarchies. Laminar hierarchical constraints that are presently available in the anatomical literature were therefore insufficient to constrain a unique ordering for any of the sensory systems we analysed. Hierarchical orderings of the monkey visual system that have been widely reported, but which were derived by hand, were not among the optimal orderings. All the cortical systems we studied displayed a significant degree of hierarchical organization, and the anatomical constraints from the monkey visual and somatomotor systems were satisfied with very few constraint violations in the optimal hierarchies. The visual and somato-motor systems in that animal were therefore surprisingly strictly hierarchical. Most inconsistencies between the constraints and the hierarchical relationships in the optimal structures for the visual system were related to connections of area FST (fundus of superior temporal sulcus). The found that the hierarchical solutions could be further improved by assuming that FST consists of two areas, which differ in the nature of their projections. Indeed, we found that perfect hierarchical arrangements of the primate visual system, without any violation of anatomical constraints, could be obtained under two reasonable conditions, namely the subdivision of FST into two distinct areas, whose connectivity we predict, and the abolition of at least one of the less reliable rule constraints. Our analyses showed that the future collection of the same type of laminar constraints, or the inclusion of new hierarchical constraints from thalamocortical connections, Mill not resolve the problem of multiple optimal hierarchical representations for the primate visual system. Further data, however, may help to specify the relative ordering of some more areas. This indeterminacy of the visual hierarchy is in part due to the reported absence of some connections between cortical areas. These absences are consistent with limited cross-talk between differentiated processing streams in the system. Hence, hierarchical representation of the visual system is affected by, and must take into account, other organizational features. such as processing streams.;Newcastle Univ, Dept Psychol, Neural Syst Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England;"N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";Hilgetag, CC (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 700 Albany St,W746, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;claush@bu.edu;"Hilgetag, Claus C/L-7282-2013; Hilgetag, Claus C/AAH-1760-2020";"Hilgetag, Claus C/0000-0003-2129-8910; Hilgetag, Claus C/0000-0003-2129-8910";;;;;37;112;115;0;7;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;1471-2970;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

The development of ocular dominance bands was studied by transneuronal labeling of the visual cortices of ferret kits between the ages of postnatal day 28 (P28) and P81 after intravitreous injections of either tritiated proline or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. Laminar specificity was evident in the youngest animals studied and was similar to that in the adult by P50. In P28 and P30 ferret kits, no modulation reminiscent of ocular dominance bands was detectable in the pattern of labeling along layer IV. By P37 a slight fluctuation in the density of labeling in layer TV was evident in serial reconstructions. By P50, the amplitude of modulation had increased considerably but the pattern of ocular dominance bands did not yet appear mature. The pattern and degree of modulation of the ocular dominance bands resembled that in adult animals by P63. Flat mounts of cortex and serial reconstructions of layer IV revealed an unusual arrangement of inputs serving the two eyes in the region rostral to the periodic ocular dominance bands. In this region, inputs serving the contralateral eye were commonly fused along a mediolateral axis, rostral to which were large and sometimes fused patches of ipsilateral input. J. Comp.

Because the TRN receives bottom-up sensory input and top-down cortical input, it could serve as an integration hub for sensory and cognitive signals. Functional evidence supports broad roles for the TRN in arousal, attention, and sensory selection. How specific circuits connecting the TRN with sensory thalamic structures implement these functions is not known. The structural organization and function of the TRN is particularly interesting in the context of highly organized sensory systems, such as the primate visual system, where neurons in the retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN) are morphologically and physiologically distinct and also specialized for processing particular features of the visual environment. To gain insight into the functional relationship between the visual sector of the TRN and the dLGN, we reconstructed a large number of TRN neurons that were retrogradely labeled following injections of rabies virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the dLGN. An independent cluster analysis, based on 10 morphological metrics measured for each reconstructed neuron, revealed three clusters of TRN neurons that differed in cell body shape and size, dendritic arborization patterns, and medial-lateral position within the TRN. TRN dendritic and axonal morphologies are inconsistent with visual stream-specific projections to the dLGN. Instead, TRN neuronal organization could facilitate transmission of global arousal and/or cognitive signals to the dLGN with retinotopic precision that preserves specialized processing of foveal versus peripheral visual information.

Areas V1, V2, and VS/MT are conserved across mammals and are central for visual behavior. To facilitate the generation of biologically accurate computational models of primate early visual processing, here we provide an overview of over 350 published studies of these three areas in the genus Macaca, whose visual system provides the closest model for human vision. The literature reports 14 anatomical connection types from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to V1 having distinct layers of origin or termination, and 194 connection types between V1, V2, and VS, forming multiple parallel and interacting visual processing streams. Moreover, within V1, there are reports of 286 and 120 types of intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively. Physiologically, tuning of neuronal responses to 11 types of visual stimulus parameters has been consistently reported. Overall, the optimal spatial frequency (SF) of constituent neurons decreases with cortical hierarchy. Moreover, VS neurons are distinct from neurons in other areas for their higher direction selectivity, higher contrast sensitivity, higher temporal frequency tuning, and wider SF bandwidth.

Interpretations of available data have led to opposing 'information funneling' and 'parallel processing' hypotheses. Using motor circuit as a model, we examined whether cortico-subcortical circuits, especially cortico-basal ganglia circuits, are funneled or parallel in the control of volitional movement. Twenty-five healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activated clusters during self-initiated, sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements of the left hand were identified in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), right lateral premotor cortex (PM) and primary motor cortex (M1), and in the right striatum and thalamus. These functionally defined clusters were applied to probabilistic tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI to examine patterns of connectivity. Striatal and thalamic sub-regions with high probabilities of connection to the motor cortices partially overlapped, with connection to the two premotor areas outspreading rostrally relative to M1. We suggest that, on a macroscopic anatomical level, there is overlap as well as segregation among connections of the motor cortices with the striatum and thalamus. This supports the notion that neuronal information of the motor cortices is funneled, and parallel processing is not an exclusive principle in the basal ganglia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Reconstructions of labeled axonal varicosities in the neostriatum and ventrobasal thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to these subcortical structures. For both groups of animals, corticostriatal projections terminated in densely packed clusters that occupied curved lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. When the tracers were injected into different whisker barrel rows, the distribution of BDA- and FR-labeled terminals in the neostriatum followed a crude somatotopic organization in which the amount of overlap was approximately the same as in the ventrobasal thalamus. When both tracers were injected into the same whisker barrel row, however, the amount of corticostriatal overlap was significantly higher than the amount of overlap observed in the ventrobasal thalamus. These results indicate that corticostriatal projections from whisker barrel cortex have an anisotropic organization that correlates with the pattern of vibrissal movements during whisking behavior.";Penn State Univ, Milton S Hershey Med Ctr H109, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA;"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health";Alloway, KD (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Milton S Hershey Med Ctr H109, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, 500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.;;Crist, J/HTP-7792-2023;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-37532, NS-29363] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;67;65;67;0;0;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Previously, this antibody has been found to label neurons associated with the Y-cell stream of processing in cats and the magnocellular or M-cell stream in macaque monkeys. In tree shrews, the antibody selectively labeled layers 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, layers that are likely to contain neurons previously classified as Y-cells. Of the two layers that contain W-cells, layer 3 was unlabeled and layer 6 was lightly labeled. In area 17, layer 3c was densely stained, as in cats and macaque monkeys. The external half of layer 5 was also densely stained, in contrast to cats where the internal half of layer 5 is stained and macaques where layer 5 is sparsely stained. Area 18 was characterized by dense, uniform staining of inner layer 3 and outer layer 5, but no pattern of alternating light and dense bands crossed the width of area 18 as in macaques. Dense labeling of these same sublayers occurred in cortical areas TA and TD just lateral to area 18. Area TD may be the homologue of area MT of primates, which also stains densely with Cat-301 in macaques.

Here we have explored the types of neurons in the macaque vestibular nuclei targeted by nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition using orthodromic identification from the caudal vermis. We found that all nodulus-target neurons are tuned to vestibular stimuli, and most are insensitive to eye movements. Such non-eye-movement neurons are thought to project to vestibulo-spinal and/or thalamo-cortical pathways. Less than 20% of nodulus-target neurons were sensitive to eye movements, suggesting that the caudal vermis can also directly influence vestibulo-ocular pathways. In general, response properties of nodulus-target neurons were diverse, spanning the whole continuum previously described in the vestibular nuclei. Most nodulus-target cells responded to both rotation and translation stimuli and only a few were selectively tuned to translation motion only. Other neurons were sensitive to net linear acceleration, similar to otolith afferents. These results demonstrate that, unlike the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus which target a particular cell group, nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition targets a large diversity of cell types in the vestibular nuclei, consistent with a broad functional significance contributing to vestibulo-ocular, vestibulo-thalamic and vestibulo-spinal pathways.;"[Meng, Hui; Dickman, J.

Nonetheless, the way cerebellar information is integrated with motor cortical commands and affects their temporal properties remains unclear. To address this issue, we activated the CTC system in primates and found that it efficiently recruits motor cortical cells; however, the cortical response was dominated by prolonged inhibition that imposed a directional activation across the motor cortex. During task performance, cortical cells that integrated CTC information fired synchronous bursts at movement onset. These cells expressed a stronger correlation with reaction time than non-CTC cells. Thus, the excitation-inhibition interplay triggered by the CTC system facilitates transient recruitment of a cortical subnetwork at movement onset. The CTC system may shape neural firing to produce the required profile to initiate movements and thus plays a pivotal role in timing motor actions.";"[Nashef, Abdulraheem; Cohen, Oren; Prut, Yifat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Dept Med Neurobiol, IL-9112102 Jerusalem, Israel; [Nashef, Abdulraheem; Cohen, Oren; Prut, Yifat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, ELSC, IL-9112102 Jerusalem, Israel; [Israel, Zvi] Hadassah Hebrew Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Jerusalem, Israel; [Harel, Ran] Sheba Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Tel Aviv, Israel";"Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center; Chaim Sheba Medical Center";"Prut, Y (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, IMRIC, Dept Med Neurobiol, IL-9112102 Jerusalem, Israel.;Prut, Y (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, ELSC, IL-9112102 Jerusalem, Israel.";yifatpr@ekmd.huji.ac.il;"Israel, Zvi/S-5814-2016; Harel, Ran/I-7482-2019";"Israel, Zvi/0000-0002-0060-5769; Harel, Ran/0000-0002-0165-7114; cohen, oren/0000-0002-2823-9019; nashef, abdulraheem/0000-0003-4308-3355";"Israel Science Foundation [ISF-1787/13]; German-Israeli Science Foundation [GIF-I-1224-396.13/2012]; Baruch Foundation";"Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); German-Israeli Science Foundation(German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development); Baruch Foundation";We thank R.

Understanding the principles of neuroanatomical organization in these structures is critical to understanding the functions they perform and ultimately how the human brain works. We have manually distilled and synthesized hundreds of primate neuroanatomy facts into a single interactive visualization. The resulting picture represents the fundamental neuroanatomical blueprint upon which cognitive functions must be implemented. Within this framework we hypothesize and detail 7 functional circuits corresponding to psychological perspectives on the brain: consolidated long-term declarative memory, short-term declarative memory, working memory/information processing, behavioral memory selection, behavioral memory output, cognitive control, and cortical information flow regulation. Each circuit is described in terms of distinguishable neuronal groups including the cerebral isocortex (9 pyramidal neuronal groups), parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, thalamus (4 neuronal groups), basal ganglia (7 neuronal groups), metencephalon, basal forebrain, and other subcortical nuclei. We focus on neuroanatomy related to primate nonprimary cortical systems to elucidate the basis underlying the distinct homotypical cognitive architecture. To display the breadth of this review, we introduce a novel method of integrating and presenting data in multiple independent visualizations: an interactive website (http://www.frontiersin.org/files/cognitiveconsilience/index.html) and standalone iPhone and iPad applications.

The most common motor complications consist in wearing-off fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements appearing when plasma levels of L-dopa are high, commonly referred to as peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Parkinsonian models exhibiting these features have been well-characterized in both rodent and nonhuman primate species. The first animal models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia were produced in monkeys lesioned with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and treated chronically with L-dopa to elicit choreic movements and dystonic postures. Seminal studies were performed in these models using both metabolic mapping and electrophysiological techniques, providing fundamental pathophysiological insights that have stood the test of time. A decade later, it was shown possible to reproduce peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in rats and mice rendered parkinsonian with nigrostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. When treated with L-dopa, these animals exhibit abnormal involuntary movements having both hyperkinetic and dystonic components. These models have enabled molecular- and cellular-level investigations into the mechanisms of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. A flourishing literature using genetically engineered mice is now unraveling the role of specific genes and neural circuits in the development of L-dopa-induced motor complications. Both non-human primate and rodent models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia have excellent construct validity and provide valuable tools for discovering therapeutic targets and evaluating potential treatments.

Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On-Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On-Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On-Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On-Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.";"[Dhande, Onkar S.; Stafford, Benjamin K.; El-Danaf, Rana; Phan, Ann H.; Nguyen, Phong L.; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 299 Campus Dr West, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Euler, Thomas; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Euler, Thomas; Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford Neurosci Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Huberman, Andrew D.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, BioX, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Franke, Katrin; Berens, Philipp] Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Franke, Katrin; Berens, Philipp] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Percival, Kumiko A.; Taylor, W.

Their role in planning novel, as compared to overlearned movement patterns is as yet not well defined. We tested for the involvement of the associative striatum (caudate/anterior putamen) in the generation of novel movement patterns, which is a critical cognitive requirement for non-routine motor behavior. Using event related functional MRI in 14 right-handed male subjects, we analyzed brain activity in the planning phase of four digit finger sequences. Subjects either executed a single overlearned four digit sequence (RECALL), or self-determined four digit sequences of varying order (GENERATE). In both conditions, RECALL and GENERATE, planning was associated with activation in mesial/lateral premotor cortices, motor cingulate cortex, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, insula, thalamus, and midbrain nuclei. When contrasting the planning phase of GENERATE with the planning phase of RECALL, there was significantly higher activation within this distributed network. At the level of the basal ganglia, the planning phase of GENERATE was associated with differentially higher activation located specifically within the associative striatum bilaterally. On the other hand, the execution phase during both conditions was associated with a shift of activity towards the posterior part of the putamen. Our data show the specific involvement of the associative striatum during the planning of non-routine movement patterns and illustrate the propagation of activity from rostral to dorsal basal ganglia sites during different stages of motor processing.

We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the BG-PFC interplay. We propose that the BG bias PFC activity by removing the inhibition of cortico-thalamo-cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the PFC. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the BG with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico-BG-cortical loops.;"[Villagrasa, Francesc; Baladron, Javier; Vitay, Julien; Schroll, Henning; Hamker, Fred H.] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Comp Sci, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany; [Antzoulatos, Evan G.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Antzoulatos, Evan G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Picower Inst Learning & Memory, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Miller, Earl K.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";"Technische Universitat Chemnitz; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwell Health; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)";Hamker, FH (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Comp Sci, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany.;fred.hamker@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de;Miller, Earl K./AAE-8187-2019;"Miller, Earl K./0000-0002-0582-6958; Baladron, Javier/0000-0003-4084-4905";"German Research Foundation (DFG) [HA2630/4-2, HA2630/8-1]; European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony [ESF-100269974]; National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health [R01MH065252]; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund; NIMH [R37MH087027]";"German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony; National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund; NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG Grants HA2630/4-2 and HA2630/8-1), the European Social Fund at the Free State of Saxony (Grant ESF-100269974), the National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health (Grant R01MH065252), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Picower Institute Innovation Fund and NIMH R37MH087027.;;52;19;19;0;8;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Noting their connections with the basal ganglia, the locomotor disturbances that occur following lesions of the PPN or cMRF, and the encouraging results of PPN deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, both the PPN and cMRF have been linked to motor control. In order to determine the existence of and characterize vestibular responses in the PPN and cMRF, we recorded single neurons from both structures during vertical and horizontal rotation, translation, and visual pursuit stimuli. The majority of PPN cells (72.5%) were vestibular-only (VO) cells that responded exclusively to rotation and translation stimuli but not visual pursuit. Visual pursuit responses were much more prevalent in the cMRF (57.1%) though close to half of cMRF cells were VO cells (41.1%). Directional preferences also differed between the PPN, which was preferentially modulated during nose-down pitch, and cMRF, which was preferentially modulated during ipsilateral yaw rotation. Finally, amplitude responses were similar between the PPN and cMRF during rotation and pursuit stimuli, but PPN responses to translation were of higher amplitude than cMRF responses. Taken together with their connections to the vestibular circuit, these results implicate the PPN and cMRF in the processing of vestibular stimuli and suggest important roles for both in responding to motion perturbations like falls and turns.

Despite the systemic impact of hypoxia-ischaemia, the resulting brain damage was previously reported to be largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are, therefore also at risk of injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. Here, we report a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11-35 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic (AMT) segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, the diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 mu m(2)) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 mu m(2)), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 mu m(2)) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 mu m(2) and 1.6 mu m(2), respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 mu m of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest.

Different types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons provide output to different thalamic nuclei, and it is therefore of interest to understand the sources of functional input to these neurons. We studied the morphologies and local excitatory input to individual layer 6 neurons in rat visual cortex by combining intracellular labeling and recording with laser-scanning photostimulation. As in previous photostimulation studies, we found significant differences in the sources of local excitatory input to different cell types. Most notably, there were differences in local input to neurons that, based on analogy to barrel cortex, are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus. The more striking finding, however, was the paucity of superficial layer input to layer 6 neurons in the rat visual cortex, contrasting sharply with layer 6 neurons in the primate visual cortex. These observations provide insight into differences in function between cortical projections to first-order versus higher-order thalamic nuclei and also show that these circuits can be organized differently in different species.;"Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Neurosci Program, San Diego, CA 92103 USA";"Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego";Callaway, EM (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;callaway@salk.edu;", Amir/AAJ-6732-2020; Zarrinpar, Amir/L-4077-2019; Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011";"Zarrinpar, Amir/0000-0001-6423-5982; Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267";"NEI NIH HHS [EY-10745] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM07198] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH-63912, R01 MH063912] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";;;29;69;69;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The results indicate that corticothalamic connections of the STS in general reciprocate thalamocortical connections. The cortex of the upper bank of the STS-multimodal areas TPO and PGa-projects to four major thalamic targets: the pulvinar complex, the mediodorsal nucleus, the limitans-suprageniculate nucleus, as well as intralaminar nuclei. Within the pulvinar complex, the main projections of the upper bank of the STS are directed to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Rostral upper bank regions tend to project caudally and medially within the PM nucleus, caudal upper bank regions, more laterally and ventrally. The mid-portion of the upper bank tends to occupy the central sector of the PM nucleus. There are also relatively minor projections from upper bank regions to the lateral pulvinar (PL) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei. In contrast to the upper bank, the projections from the lower bank are directed primarily to the pulvinar complex, with only minor projections to intralaminar nuclei. The rostral portion of the lower bank projects mainly to caudal and medial regions of the PM nucleus, whereas the caudal lower bank projects predominantly to the lateral PM nucleus, and also to the PL, PO, and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei. The mid-portion of the lower bank projects mainly to central and lateral portions of the PM nucleus, and also to the PI and PL nuclei. The rostral depth of the STS projects mainly to the PM nucleus, with only minor connections to the PO, PI, and PL nuclei. The mid-portion of multimodal area TPO of the upper bank, areas TPO2 and TPO3, projects preferentially to the central sector of the PM nucleus. It is possible that this STS-thalamic connectivity has a role in behavior that is dependent upon more than one sensory modality.;"EDITH NOURSE ROGERS MEM VET ADM HOSP, BEDFORD, MA 01730 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; HARVARD UNIV, BETH ISRAEL HOSP, NEUROL UNIT, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center";YETERIAN, EH (corresponding author), COLBY COLL, DEPT PSYCHOL, WATERVILLE, ME 04901 USA.;;;;PHS HHS [16841] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;120;46;46;0;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

In this review, we summarize recent findings where molecular biological techniques have revealed a small number of area-specific genes in the nonhuman primate cortex. One of these (occl) is strongly expressed in primary visual cortex and is associated with thalamocortical connections. Another gene, RBP, is more strongly expressed in association areas. It is not clear whether RBP might be linked with any particular connectional system, but several possibilities are raised. We also discuss possible roles of area-specific genes in postnatal development, and conclude with a brief sketch of future directions.

In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), cells show distinct properties such as selectivity for particular wavelengths, increments or decrements in contrast, or preference for fine detail versus rapid motion. No studies, however, have measured how LGN cells respond when an animal is challenged to make a perceptual decision using information within the receptive fields of those LGN cells. In this study we measured neural activity in the macaque LGN during a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) contrast detection task or during a passive fixation task and found that a small proportion (13.5%) of single LGN parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) neurons matched the psychophysical performance of the monkey. The majority of LGN neurons measured in both tasks were not as sensitive as the monkey. The covariation between neural response and behavior (quantified as choice probability) was significantly above chance during active detection, even when there was no external stimulus. Interneuronal correlations and task-related gain modulations were negligible under the same condition. A bottom- up pooling model that used sensory neural responses to compute perceptual choices in the absence of interneuronal correlations could fully explain these results at the level of the LGN, supporting the hypothesis that the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple sensory neurons and that response fluctuations in these neurons can influence perception.;"[Jiang, Yaoguang; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Yampolsky, Dmitry; Purushothaman, Gopathy; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University";Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, PMB 407935,465 21st Ave S, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu;;;"NIH Core Grant [EY008126, HD15052]; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [EY001778, R21 EY019132]";"NIH Core Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants EY001778 and R21 EY019132 (to V.

To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Methods: Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation daring thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Results: Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusions: A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients.

We used an amphetamine challenge combined with pharmacologic magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to map DA-associated circuitry in nonhuman primates with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Seven control cynomolgous monkeys and 10 MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated parkinsonian primates were studied longitudinally using both positron emission tomography ( PET) and phMRI. Amphetamine challenge (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in control monkeys increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in a number of brain regions not described previously, such as parafascicular thalamus, precentral gyrus, and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. With the high spatial resolution, we were also able to readily identify changes in rCBV in the anterior cingulate, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, caudate (tail and head), putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Amphetamine induced decreases in rCBV in occipital and posterior parietal cortices. Parkinsonian primates had a prominent loss of response to amphetamine, with relative sparing of the nucleus accumbens and parafascicular thalamus. There was a significant correlation between rCBV loss in the substantia nigra and both PET imaging of dopamine transporters and behavioral measures. Monkeys with partial lesions as defined by 2alpha-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane binding to dopamine transporters showed recruitment of premotor and motor cortex after amphetamine stimulus similar to what has been noted in Parkinson's patients during motor tasks. These data indicate that phMRI is a powerful tool for assessment of dynamic changes associated with normal and dysfunctional DA brain circuitry in primates.;"Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Positron Emiss Tomog Ctr, Boston, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Nucl Magnet Resonance Ctr, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02129 USA; McLean Hosp, Neuroregenerat Lab, Belmont, MA 02478 USA";"Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; McLean Hospital";Jenkins, BG (corresponding author), MGH, Nucl Magnet Resonance Ctr, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Bldg 149,13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.;bgj@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu;"Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/ABD-8661-2021; Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/AAZ-9566-2021";"Sanchez-Pernaute, Rosario/0000-0003-1144-9025; Isacson, Ole/0000-0001-8091-8302";"NCRR NIH HHS [P51RR00168, P51 RR000168] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHS [DA-16187A, P01 DA009467, R01 DA016187, DA-09467] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [P50 NS039793-05, P50 NS039793, NS-39793] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;47;72;76;2;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Differentiation of the pontine sensory syndrome from the thalamic sensory syndrome has generally been made on the basis of distribution of sensory loss and involvement of specific sensory modalities but not without uncertainties and difficulties. Because the pontine tegmentum plays a pivotal role in generating horizontal eye movement, we attempted to discriminate these 2 syndromes by analyzing horizontal eye movements in stroke patients with pure hemisensory syndrome. Methods-Horizontal saccade, pursuit, vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR), and VOR cancellation (VORC) were evaluated using electro-oculography in 6 patients with hemisensory syndromes, 3 due to pontine stroke and 3 due to thalamic stroke, and all were verified by MRI or CT. In addition, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded. Results-Smooth pursuit and VORC directed toward the side of the lesion were impaired unilaterally in patients with pontine sensory stroke, whereas those 2 movements were intact bilaterally in patients with thalamic sensory stroke. Saccade and VOR were preserved in all patients. SEPs were normal in all patients with pontine and thalamic sensory strokes. No difference was found in the pattern of sensory disturbance between the 2 types of stroke patients. Conclusions-Ipsilateral impairment of the smooth pursuit system may be a sign of a pontine lesion in patients with hemisensory stroke.;"Yokohama City Univ, Urafune Hosp, Dept Neurol, Minami Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232, Japan; Higashimatsudo Municipal Hosp, Dept Neurol, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan; Yokohama City Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232, Japan";"Yokohama City University; Yokohama City University";Johkura, K (corresponding author), Yokohama City Univ, Urafune Hosp, Dept Neurol, Minami Ku, 3-46 Urafune Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232, Japan.;;;Komiyama, Atsushi/0000-0002-6863-0397;;;;;28;6;6;0;2;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;227 EAST WASHINGTON SQ, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0039-2499;;;STROKE;Stroke;NOV;1998;29;11;;;;;2377;2380;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.STR.29.11.2377;;;4;"Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology";134QM;9804652;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000076754100024;View Full Record in Web of Science

To examine the cellular bases for these differences, we exposed rhesus macaque fetuses to x-rays during early gestation (embryonic day [E]30E42), i.e., before the onset of corticogenesis, or in midgestation (E70E81), when superficial cortical layers are generated. Animals were delivered at term (approximate to E165), and the size and cellular composition of prefrontal association cortex (area 46) examined in adults using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and stereologic analysis. Both early and midgestational radiation exposure diminished the surface area and volume of area 46. However, early exposure spared cortical thickness and did not alter laminar composition, and due to higher cell density, neuron number was within the normal range. In contrast, exposure to x-rays at midgestation reduced cortical thickness, mainly due to elimination of neurons destined for the superficial layers. A cell-sparse gap, observed within layer III, was not filled by the later-generated neurons destined for layer II, indicating that there is no subsequent replacement of the lost neurons. The distinct areal and laminar pathology consequent to temporally segregated irradiation is consistent with basic postulates of the radial unit hypothesis of cortical development. In addition, we show that an environmental disturbance inflicted in early gestation can induce subtle cytoarchitectonic alterations without loss of neurons, such as those observed in schizophrenia, whereas midgestational exposure causes selective elimination of neurons and cortical thinning as observed in some forms of mental retardation and fetal alcohol syndrome.

They are termed caudal and rostral forelimb areas (CFA and RFA). In this study, it was confirmed first that RFA and CFA are located in cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (medial and lateral parts of agranular cortex (AGm and AGI), respectively). In the second part of this study, the distribution of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to RFA and CFA was quantitatively compared by injections of small and relatively constant amounts of retrograde fluorescent dyes (diamidino yellow and fast blue) into these areas. It was observed that (1) main inputs to RFA originated from AGI, namely CFA (2) CFA received dominant inputs from AGm including RFA and caudally adjacent granular cortex and (3) wider cortical areas and larger number of neurons projected to CFA than to RFA. As for the thalamocortical projections, both RFA and CFA received inputs from various thalamic nuclei, such as VL, VM, Po, PC, PF, CL, but cells projecting to RFA and CFA were differentially located in each nucleus. It was found that labeled cell number and/or density in VM, PC, CL, CM and MD after RFA injections were significantly larger than those after CFA injections. On the other hand, labeled cell number and/or density in VPL and VL were significantly higher after CFA injections than after RFA injections. In comparison with findings in primates, the results suggest that the cortical motor areas of rats may be specialized for different aspects of motor control.

To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates. In addition, these results provide further evidence for proposed subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar.

According to their model, core auditory cortex receives predominantly unimodal sensory input from the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGBv); whereas belt cortex receives predominantly cross-modal sensory input from nuclei outside the MGBv. We previously characterized distinct response properties in rat primary (A1) versus ventral auditory field (VAF) cortex; however, it has been unclear whether VAF should be categorized as a core or belt auditory cortex. The current study employed high-resolution functional imaging to map intrinsic metabolic responses to tones and to guide retrograde tracer injections into A1 and VAF. The size and density of retrogradely labeled somas in the medial geniculate body (MGB) were examined as a function of their position along the caudal-to-rostral axis, subdivision of origin, and cortical projection target. A1 and VAF projecting neurons were found in the same subdivisions of the MGB but in rostral and caudal parts, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells projected to both regions. VAF projecting neurons were smaller than A1 projecting neurons located in dorsal (MGBd) and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei. Thus, soma size varied with both caudal-rostral position and cortical target. Finally, the majority (>70%) of A1 and VAF projecting neurons were located in MGBv. These MGB connection profiles suggest that rat auditory cortex, like primate auditory cortex, is made up of multiple distinct core regions. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:1630-1646, 2010.

Pyramidal neurons in PFC deep layer 3 play a central role in both thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry. Given that somal size tends to be associated with both the dendritic and axonal architecture of a neuron, abnormalities in these circuits in schizophrenia may be associated with a change in the somal size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Methods: We used design-based stereology to estimate the somal volume of pyramidal neurons in deep layer 3 of PFC area 9 in 28 subjects with schizophrenia, each of whom was matched to 1 normal comparison subject for sex, age, and postmortem interval. Results: The geometric mean of the somal volume estimates in the subjects with schizophrenia was significantly (P=.02) decreased by 9.2%. This decrease was associated with a shift in the distribution of somal volumes toward smaller sizes. Neither antipsychotic medication treatment history nor duration of illness was associated with somal size. Conclusions: These findings independently replicate previous reports of decreased somal size in the PFC in schizophrenia. The reduction in size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons is consistent with abnormalities in thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry, suggesting that disruption of these circuits may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia.;"Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Lewis, DA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, 3811 Ohara St,W1650 BST, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;;Lewis, David A/G-4053-2014;Lewis, David A/0000-0002-3225-6778;NIMH NIH HHS [MH60473, MH45156, MH18951, MH00519] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;58;188;188;0;1;AMER MEDICAL ASSOC;CHICAGO;515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA;0003-990X;;;ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT;Arch.

The rare surviving geniculate projection neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from extra-striate cortex and retinogeniculate terminals were labelled by an intraocular injection of HRP. Retinal terminals in the degenerated dLGN made synaptic contact exclusively with the dendrites of interneurons immunopositive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in both parvocellular and magnocellular regions of dLGN. As well as being postsynaptic to retinal terminals these vesicle-containing dendrites were pre- and postsynaptic to other similar dendrites, and presynaptic to relay cells. Surviving labelled projection neurons received retinal input indirectly, via both the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and GABA-immunonegative terminals characteristic of those from the superior colliculus. In the degenerated, as opposed to the normal dLGN, about 20% of retinal terminals were GABA-immunopositive and GABA-immunoreactivity was prominently elevated in the ganglion and amacrine cell layers of the degenerated half of the retina. The optic nerve also contained numerous GABA-immunopositive axons but very few such axons were found in a normal optic nerve processed in identical manner. The surviving pathways from the retina must underlie the visual abilities that survive striate cortical removal in monkeys and human patients and may involve the degenerated dLGN as well as the mid-brain.;"UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, S PARKS RD, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND; UNIV MUNICH, INST MED PSYCHOL, W-8000 MUNICH 2, GERMANY; MRC, ANAT NEUROPHARMACOL UNIT, OXFORD OX1 3QT, ENGLAND; HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI, UNITED RES ORG, H-1094 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY; SEMMELWEIS UNIV, SCH MED, H-1094 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY";"University of Oxford; University of Munich; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Semmelweis University";;;;;;;;;80;46;46;0;4;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

This introduces the possibility of a re-entrant motion signal affecting the relay of the retinal input through the LGN to the visual cortex. The question is whether the response of LGN cells to moving stimuli involves a component derived from this feedback. By producing a reversible focal pharmacological block of the activity of an MT direction column we show the presence of such an influence from MT on the responses of magno, parvo and koniocellular cells in the macaque LGN. The pattern of effect in the LGN reflects the direction bias of the MT location inactivated. This suggests a moving stimulus is captured by iterative interactions in the circuit formed by visual cortical areas and visual thalamus. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the impact of amblyopia on the white matter within the visual system. We studied the properties of six major visual white-matter pathways in a group of adults with amblyopia (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 10) using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography. While we did not find significant differences in diffusion properties in cortico-cortical pathways, patients with amblyopia exhibited increased mean diffusivity in thalamo-cortical visual pathways. These findings suggest that amblyopia may systematically alter the white matter properties of early visual pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is growing evidence that such knowledge may be acquired through a number of different means, each perhaps with its own neuronal substrate. One major distinction is between serial order information acquired intentionally and leading to explicit conscious knowledge of the sequence structure, and information acquired incidentally through experience. While this latter form of knowledge influences behaviour, it may do so without the participant being aware of the sequential information, i.e. it is acquired implicitly. Evidence from physiological and lesion studies in animals and imaging studies in humans suggests that these two forms of learning may have dissociable neuronal substrates. Specifically, the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit centred on the caudate nucleus is proposed to be involved in intentional sequence learning and that based on the putamen on incidental learning. The present study tested one part of this proposed dissociation by assessing patients with Huntington's disease on tasks of the two forms of learning. On the test of trial-and-error intentional learning there were marked deficits, which were closely related to disease progression and to measures of executive cognitive dysfunction. This finding was in contrast to the finding from the incidental learning task. Performance of the Huntington's disease group was essentially normal and unrelated to measures of disease progression and cognitive status. The results, although supportive of the proposed dual-system hypothesis, offer only partial confirmation. Further direct study is required using similar tasks in patients with putamenal disorder or lesions within the skeletomotor striato-thalamo-cortical circuit.;"Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol, London SE5 8AF, England; UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England; Hosp Virgen Macarena, Dept Neurol, Seville, Spain; Hosp Virgen Macarena, Dept Mol Genet, Seville, Spain";"University of London; King's College London; University of London; University College London; Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena; Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena";Brown, RG (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.;r.brown@iop.kcl.ac.uk;"Channon, Shelley/C-1754-2008; Brown, Richard G/A-9599-2010";Brown, Richard G/0000-0001-9021-0172;;;;;78;37;38;0;12;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;NOV;2001;124;;11;;;;2188;2202;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/124.11.2188;;;15;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;494QC;11673321;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000172295500007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and its consequences on brain functions, is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive) and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds, and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls. We found AT8-positive staining and 4R-tau inclusions only in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques. Characteristic pathological hallmarks of progressive supranuclear palsy, including globose and neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes and coiled bodies, were found close to the injection sites but also in connected brain regions that are known to be affected in progressive supranuclear palsy (striatum, pallidum, thalamus). Interestingly, while glial AT8-positive lesions were the most frequent near the injection site, we found mainly neuronal inclusions in the remote brain area, consistent with a neuronal transsynaptic spreading of the disease. Our results demonstrate that progressive supranuclear palsy patient-derived tau aggregates can induce motor and behavioural impairments in non-human primates related to the prion-like seeding and spreading of typical pathological progressive supranuclear palsy lesions. This pilot study paves the way for supporting progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaque as a relevant animal model to accelerate drug development targeting this rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease.

However, growing recognition of the dopamine (DA) loss and other pathology in extra-striatal brain regions has led to uncertainty whether loss of DA in the striatum is sufficient to cause parkinsonian signs. We tested this hypothesis by infusing cis-flupenthixol (cis-flu: a broad-spectrum D1/D2 receptor antagonist) into different regions of the macaque putamen (3 hemispheres of 2 monkeys) while the animal performed a visually-cued choice reaction time task in which visual cues indicated the arm to reach with and the peripheral target to contact to obtain food reward. Following reward delivery, the animal was required to self-initiate release of the peripheral target and return of the chosen hand to its home position (i.e., without the benefit of external sensory cues or immediate rewards). Infusions of cis-flu at 15 of 26 sites induced prolongations of reaction time (9 of 15 cases), movement duration (6 cases), and/or dwell time of the hand at the peripheral target (8 cases). Dwell times were affected more severely (+ 95%) than visually-triggered reaction times or movement durations (+25% and +15%, respectively). Specifically, the animal's hand often 'froze' at the peripheral target for up to 25-s, similar to the akinetic freezing episodes observed in PD patients. Across injections, slowing of self-initiation did not correlate in severity with prolongations of visually-triggered reaction time or movement duration, although the latter two were correlated with each other. Episodes of slowed self-initiation appeared primarily in the arm contralateral to the injected hemisphere and were not associated with increased muscle co-contraction or global alterations in behavioral state (i.e., inattention or reduced motivation), consistent with the idea that these episodes reflected a fundamental impairment of movement initiation. We found no evidence for an anatomic topography within the putamen for the effects elicited. We conclude that acute focal blockade of DA transmission in the putamen is sufficient to induce marked akinesia-like impairments. Furthermore, different classes of impairments can be induced independently, suggesting that specific parkinsonian signs have unique pathophysiologic substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and its consequences on brain functions, is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive) and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds, and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls. We found AT8-positive staining and 4R-tau inclusions only in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques. Characteristic pathological hallmarks of progressive supranuclear palsy, including globose and neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes and coiled bodies, were found close to the injection sites but also in connected brain regions that are known to be affected in progressive supranuclear palsy (striatum, pallidum, thalamus). Interestingly, while glial AT8-positive lesions were the most frequent near the injection site, we found mainly neuronal inclusions in the remote brain area, consistent with a neuronal transsynaptic spreading of the disease. Our results demonstrate that progressive supranuclear palsy patient-derived tau aggregates can induce motor and behavioural impairments in non-human primates related to the prion-like seeding and spreading of typical pathological progressive supranuclear palsy lesions. This pilot study paves the way for supporting progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaque as a relevant animal model to accelerate drug development targeting this rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease.

This state-dependence is believed to arise, at least in part, in response to inputs from subcortical structures that release neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, often nonsynaptically. The mechanisms that underlie the interaction between these nonsynaptic signals and the more point-to-point synaptic cortical circuitry are not well understood. This review highlights the state of the field, with a focus on cholinergic action in early visual processing. Key anatomical and physiological features of both the cholinergic and the visual systems are discussed. Furthermore, presenting evidence of cholinergic modulation in visual thalamus and primary visual cortex, we explore potential functional roles of acetylcholine and its effects on the processing of visual input over the sleep-wake cycle, sensory gain control during wakefulness, and consider evidence for cholinergic support of visual attention.;"[Krueger, Juliane; Disney, Anita A.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 311 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA";Duke University;Krueger, J (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 311 Res Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.;juliane.krueger@duke.edu;;"Krueger, Juliane/0000-0001-9074-7025; Disney, Anita/0000-0003-3390-0681";National Institutes of Health [R01 EY025422, R00 MH093567];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Numbers: R01 EY025422, R00 MH093567;;161;17;17;0;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

This would be reflected in significant structural differences between poor-outcome (i.e., Kraepelinian) and non-Kraepelinian patients. To assess this possibility, we have evaluated the degree of deviation in brain structure in Kraepelinian patients with respect to controls and non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients. We used voxel-brain morphometry (VBM) to assess the differences in gray matter volume across the brain in the Kraepelinian group with respect to the healthy controls and non-Kraepelinian patients. Twenty-six Kraepelinian and 18 non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients and 41 healthy controls were included. With respect to the healthy controls, the Kraepelinian patients showed a very significant decrease in gray matter in the frontal, occipital, and limbic cortices, and, at a subcortical level, bilaterally in the striatum and thalamus. In comparison with the non-Kraepelinian patients, the Kraepelinian individuals continued to show a similar subcortical decrease. Thus, Kraepelinian patients may be characterized by a distinct pattern of brain abnormalities, in particular, in subcortical regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

While MMN has been extensively used in human electrophysiological studies of auditory processing, the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying its generation remain unclear. We investigate possible homologs of the MMN in macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) using a frequency oddball paradigm in which rare deviant tones are randomly interspersed among frequent standard tones. Standards and deviants had frequencies equal to the best frequency (BF) of the recorded neural population or to a frequency that evoked a response half the amplitude of the BF response. Early and later field potentials, current source density components, multiunit activity, and induced high-gamma band responses were larger when elicited by deviants than by standards of the same frequency. Laminar analysis indicated that differences between deviant and standard responses were more prominent in later activity, thus suggesting cortical amplification of initial responses driven by thalamocortical inputs. However, unlike the human MMN, larger deviant responses were characterized by the enhancement of obligatory responses rather than the introduction of new components. Furthermore, a control condition wherein deviants were interspersed among many tones of variable frequency replicated the larger responses to deviants under the oddball condition. Results suggest that differential responses under the oddball condition in macaque A1 reflect stimulus-specific adaptation rather than deviance detection per se.

The thalamic input to these two subregions was studied and quantified to gain more information about the influence of the cerebellum and basal ganglia on the oculomotor control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex. A recent study using transneuronal transport of virus demonstrated that there are neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellum that project to the FEFsac with only a single intervening synapse (Lynch et al., 1994). In the present study, we concentrated on the thalamic input to the FEFsem to define possible basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex and cerebellum-thalamus-cortex channels of information flow to the FEFsem. We localized the functional subregions using low threshold microstimulation, and retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were then placed into the FEFsem and FEFsac. The neurons that project to the FEFsem are distributed in (1) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (2) the caudal portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (3) the mediodorsal nucleus, (4) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars parvocellularis, and (5) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars magnocellularis. In contrast, the large majority of neurons that project to the FEFsac are located in the paralaminar region of the mediodorsal nucleus. The FEFsac and FEFsem thus each receive neural input from both basal ganglia-receiving and cerebellar-receiving cell groups in the thalamus, but each receives input from a unique combination of thalamic nuclei.;"UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT ANAT, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA; UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA; UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT NEUROL, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA";"University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center";;;;;NEI NIH HHS [2-R01-EY-04159] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;109;50;51;0;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The following study utilized a double labeling paradigm, using antibodies that recognize non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and other neuronal markers, to further define, quantitatively, the subclasses of neurons that contain immunoreactivity for the AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor subunits in the monkey prefrontal cortex. Double labeling with an antibody that recognizes common epitopes in AMPA/kainate subunits GluR2 and GluR3 (GluR2/3) in combination with an antibody that recognizes the kainate receptor subunits GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 (GluR5/6/7) demonstrated that immunoreactivity for these two receptor classes was highly colocalized in a great majority of the pyramidal neurons in this region but present in only a minority of neurochemically identified subclasses of GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, GluR2/3 immunoreactivity had principally a somatic distribution whereas GluR5/6/7 labeling was predominately found in the perikarya and/or particular dendritic domains. In contrast, intense GluR1 labeling was observed in a small subpopulation of interneurons and low GluR1 immunoreactivity was present in many other cortical neurons. These results demonstrate that there is a high degree of specificity in the distribution of AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor-class proteins to subclasses of neurons within the neocortex. A neuron's combination of excitatory amino acid receptor subunits may regulate its response to excitatory inputs and further defines the role of identified subclasses of neurons in the complex circuitry of the cerebral cortex and may also indicate the basis for the apparent cellular selectivity of excitotoxic degenerative processes.;"CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL, BOX 1065, 1 GUSTAVE L LEVY PL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, HYBRIDOMA FACL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; SALK INST BIOL STUDIES, MOLEC NEUROBIOL LAB, LA JOLLA, CA 92037 USA; UNIV COLORADO, HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT PHARMACOL, DENVER, CO 80262 USA";"City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Salk Institute; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Colorado Denver";;;"Morrison, John H/F-9229-2012; Vickers, James C/J-7464-2014";"Vickers, James C/0000-0001-5671-4879; Huntley, George W./0000-0003-3645-6192";NIA NIH HHS [AG06647] Funding Source: Medline;NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA));;;64;143;143;0;4;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

However, the mechanisms by which attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.;"[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

The present study addressed this question from the point of view of connectional properties by comparing the afferent and efferent projections of the caudal forelimb area (CFA), considered to be the equivalent of the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (MI), and a second forelimb motor representation, the rostral forelimb area (RFA). As a result of various tracing experiments (including double labeling), it was observed that CFA and RFA had reciprocal corticocortical connections characterized by preferential, asymmetrical, laminar distribution, indicating that RFA may occupy a different hierarchical level than CFA, according to criteria previously discussed in the visual cortex of primates. Furthermore, it was found that RFA, but not CFA, exhibited dense reciprocal connections with the insular cortex. With respect to their efferent projection to the basal ganglia, it was observed that CFA projected very densely to the lateral portion of the ipsilateral caudate putamen, whereas the contralateral projection was sparse and more restricted. The ipsilateral projection originating from RFA was slightly less dense than that from CFA, but it covered a larger portion of the caudate putamen (in the medial direction); the contralateral projection from RFA to the caudate putamen was of the same density and extent as the ipsilateral projection. The reciprocal thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of RFA and CFA differed from each other in the sense that CFA was mainly interconnected with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, while RFA was mainly connected with the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. Altogether, these connectional differences, compared with the pattern of organization of the motor cortical areas in primates, suggest that RFA in the rat may well be an equivalent of the premotor or supplementary motor area. In contrast to the corticocortical, corticostriatal, and thalamocortical connections, RFA and CFA showed similar efferent projections to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, tectum, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, and spinal cord.";;;ROUILLER, EM (corresponding author), UNIV FRIBOURG,INST PHYSIOL,RUE MUSEE 5,CH-1700 FRIBOURG,SWITZERLAND.;;Liang, Fengyi/A-7521-2018;"Liang, Fengyi/0000-0003-1162-6212; Rouiller, Eric/0000-0003-1355-6019";;;;;66;141;141;0;11;CARFAX PUBL CO;ABINGDON;PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

In this study, we examined the extent and anatomical organization of cerebellar input to multiple regions of prefrontal cortex. We first used conventional retrograde tracers to map the origin of thalamic projections to five prefrontal regions: medial area 9 (9m), lateral area 9 (9l), dorsal area 46 (46d), ventral area 46, and lateral area 12. Only areas 46d, 9m, and 9l received substantial input from thalamic regions included within the zone of termination of cerebellar efferents. This suggested that these cortical areas were the target of cerebellar output. We tested this possibility using retrograde transneuronal transport of the McIntyre-B strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 from areas of prefrontal cortex. Neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport of virus were found in the dentate nucleus only after injections into areas 46d, 9m, and 9l. The precise location of labeled neurons in the dentate varied with the prefrontal area injected. In addition, the dentate neurons labeled after virus injections into prefrontal areas were located in regions spatially separate from those labeled after virus injections into motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Our observations indicate that the cerebellum influences several areas of prefrontal cortex via the thalamus. Furthermore, separate output channels exist in the dentate to influence motor and cognitive operations. These results provide an anatomical substrate for the cerebellum to be involved in cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, and rule-based learning.;"Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, W1640 Biomed Sci Tower,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.;strickp@pitt.edu;;Middleton, Frank/0000-0002-3107-7188;NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH056661, MH48185, F31 MH011262, MH11262, MH56661] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;122;727;747;1;35;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The present study examined stimulus-evoked brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female cynomolgus macaques following unilateral L7 spinal nerve ligation and the effects of clinical analgesics pregabalin, duloxetine, and morphine on brain activation in these macaques. A modified straight leg raise test was used to assess pain severity in awake animals and to evoke regional brain activation in anesthetized animals. The potential effects of clinical analgesics on both awake pain behavior and regional brain activation were examined. Following spinal nerve ligation, both male and female macaques showed significantly decreased ipsilateral straight leg raise thresholds, suggesting the presence of radicular-like pain. Morphine treatment increased straight leg raise thresholds in both males and females whereas duloxetine and pregabalin did not. In male macaques, the ipsilateral straight leg raise activated contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII), and thalamus. In female macaques, the ipsilateral leg raise activated cingulate cortex and contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex. Straight leg raises of the contralateral, unligated leg did not evoke brain activation. Morphine reduced activation in all brain regions in both male and female macaques. In males, neither pregabalin nor duloxetine decreased brain activation compared with vehicle treatment. In females, however, pregabalin and duloxetine decreased the activation of cingulate cortex compared with vehicle treatment. The current findings suggest a differential activation of brain areas depending on sex following a peripheral nerve injury. Differential brain activation observed in this study could underlie qualitative sexual dimorphism in clinical chronic pain perception and responses to analgesics.

Results: The probabilistic tractography was consistent from subject-to-subject and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract. Higher overlap between the tractography-identified location and the tcMRgFUS treatment-induced lesion highly correlated with better treatment outcome (r=-0.929, -0.75, -0.643, p=0.00675, 0.0663, 0.139 for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus, respectively, at 1 year post-treatment). The correlation for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex is the highest for all time points (r=-0.719, -0.976, -0.707, -0.929, p=0.0519, 0.000397, 0.0595, 0.00675 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment, respectively). Conclusion: Our data support the use of diffusion tractography as a complementary approach to current targeting methods for tcMRgFUS thalamotomy.;"[Tian, Qiyuan; Pauly, Kim Butts] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tian, Qiyuan; Wintermark, Max; Ghanouni, Pejman; Goubran, Maged; Thaler, Christian; Airan, Raag; Zeineh, Michael; Pauly, Kim Butts; McNab, Jennifer A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Elias, W.

Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (induding direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.;"[Merchant, Hugo] UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Grahn, Jessica] Univ Western Ontario, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Grahn, Jessica] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Trainor, Laurel] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rohrmeier, Martin] MIT Intelligence Initiat, Dept Linguist & Philosophy, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fitch, W.

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources.

Although brain regions involved in strategic memory retrieval in general have been identified, differences in retrieval operations related to distinct retrieval strategies are not well-understood. Thus, our aim was to identify brain regions whose activity is differentially involved in spatial-associative and temporal-associative retrieval. First, we showed that our behavioral paradigm probing memory for a set of object-location associations promoted the use of a spatial-associative structure following an encoding condition that provided Multiple associations to neighboring objects (spatial-associative condition) and the use of a temporal-associative structure following another study condition that provided predominantly temporal associations between sequentially presented items (temporal-associative condition). Next, we used an adapted version of this paradigm for functional MRI, where we contrasted brain activity related to the recall of object-location associations that were either encoded in the spatial- or the temporal-associative condition. In addition to brain regions generally involved in recall, we found that activity in higher-order visual regions, including the fusiform gyrus, the lingual gyrus, and the cuneus, was relatively enhanced when subjects used a spatial-associative structure for retrieval. In contrast, activity in the globus pallidus and the thalamus was relatively enhanced when subjects used a temporal-associative structure for retrieval. In conclusion, we provide evidence for differential involvement of these brain regions related to different types of strategic memory retrieval and the neural structures described play a role in either spatial-associative or temporal-associative memory retrieval.;"[de Rover, Mischa; Petersson, Karl Magnus; Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, FC Donders Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Werf, Sieberen R.; Berger, Hans J.] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Med Psychol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Cools, Alexander R.] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Psychneuropharmacol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Fernandez, Guillen] Univ Med Ctr Nijmegen, Dept Neurol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands";"Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen";de Rover, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Downing Site, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.;md415@cam.ac.uk;"Petersson, Karl Magnus/E-8188-2012; Petersson, Karl Magnus/HDO-0143-2022; GNC, GNC/B-5716-2013; Fernandez, Guillen/B-3771-2009";"Petersson, Karl Magnus/0000-0002-8245-0392; Petersson, Karl Magnus/0000-0002-8245-0392; Fernandez, Guillen/0000-0002-5522-0604";;;;;81;25;25;0;12;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1065-9471;1097-0193;;HUM BRAIN MAPP;Hum.

These effects have not been confirmed in humans because of the lack of a non-inva- sive, practical in vivo imaging tool with the ability to detect these changes. Following the successful use of ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy (UBS) to monitor in vivo cell death in breast tumors, we aimed to use UBS to assess the neuro- toxicity of the anesthetic sevoflurane (SEVO) in a non -human primate (NHP) model. Sixteen 2- to 7 -day -old rhesus macaques were exposed for 5 h to SEVO. Ultrasound scanning was done with a phased array transducer on a clinical ultrasound scanner operated at 10 MHz. Data consisting of 10 - 15 frames of radiofrequency (RF) echo signals from coronal views of the thalamus were obtained 0.5 and 6.0 h after initiating exposure. The UBS parameter ?effective scat- terer size?(ESS) was estimated by fitting a scattering form factor (FF) model to the FF measured from RF echo sig- nals. The approach involved analyzing the frequency dependence of the measured FF to characterize scattering sources and selecting the FF model based on a chi(2) goodness -of -fit criterion. To assess data quality, a rigorous acceptance criterion based on the analysis of prevalence of diffuse scattering (an assumption in the estimation of ESS) was estab- lished. ESS changes after exposure to SEVO were compared with changes in a control group of five primates for which ultrasound data were acquired at 0 and 10 min (no apoptosis expected). Over the entire data set, the average measured FF at 0.5 and 6.0 h monotonically decreased with frequency, justifying fitting a single FF over the analysis bandwidth. chi(2) values of a (inhomogeneous continuum) Gaussian FF model were one -fifth those of the discrete fluid sphere model, suggesting that a continuum scatterer model better represents ultrasound scattering in the young rhesus brain. After application of the data quality criterion, only 5 of 16 subjects from the apoptotic group and 5 of 5 subjects from the con- trol group fulfilled the acceptance criteria. All subjects in the apoptotic group that passed the acceptance criterion exhibited a significant ESS reduction at 6.0 h. These changes ( - 6.4%, 95% Interquartile Range: -14.3% to -3.3%) were larger than those in the control group ( - 0.8%, 95% Interquartile Range:- 2.0% to 1.5%]). Data with a low prevalence of diffuse scattering corresponded to possibly biased results. Thus, ESS has the potential to detect changes in brain microstructure related to anesthesia -induced apoptosis.

A fully automated synthesis of (-)-[F-18]flubatine as a sterile isotonic solution suitable for clinical use is reported, as well as the first evaluation in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared by fluorination of the Boc-protected trimethylammonium iodide precursor with [F-18]fluoride in an automated synthesis module. Subsequent deprotection of the Boc group with 1-M HCl yielded (-)-[F-18]flubatine, which was purified by semi-preparative HPLC. (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared in 25% radiochemical yield (formulated for clinical use at end of synthesis, n=3), >95% radiochemical purity, and specific activity=4647Ci/mmol (171.9GBq/mu mol). Doses met all quality control criteria confirming their suitability for clinical use. Evaluation of (-)-[F-18]flubatine in rhesus macaques was performed with a Concorde MicroPET P4 scanner (Concorde MicroSystems, Knoxville, TN). The brain was imaged for 90min, and data were reconstructed using the 3-D maximum a posteriori algorithm. Image analysis revealed higher uptake and slower washout in the thalamus than those in other areas of the brain and peak uptake at 45min. Injection of 2.5 mu g/kg of nifene at 60min initiated a slow washout of [F-18]flubatine, with about 25% clearance from the thalamus by the end of imaging at 90min.

However, association cortices also receive, albeit weak, direct thalamocortical sensory inputs of unknown function. For example, while information proceeds from primary (SI) to secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex in a serial fashion, both areas are known to receive direct thalamocortical sensory input. The present study examines the potential roles of such parallel input arrangements. The subjects were presented with median nerve somatosensory stimuli with the instruction to respond with the contralateral hand. The locations and time courses of the activated brain areas were first identified with magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a subsequent session, these brain areas were modulated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 15-210 ms after the somatosensory stimulus while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. TMS pulses at 15-40 ms post-stimulus significantly speeded up reaction times and somatosensory-evoked responses, with largest facilitatory effects when the TMS pulse was given to contralateral SII at about 20 ms. To explain the results, we propose that the early somatosensory-evoked physiological SII activation exerts an SII -> SI influence that facilitates the reciprocal SI -> SII pathway - with TMS to SII we apparently amplified this mechanism. The results suggest that the human brain may utilize parallel inputs to facilitate long-distance cortico-cortical connections, resulting in accelerated processing and speeded reaction times. This arrangement could also allow very early top- down modulation of the bottom-up stream of sensory information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes inmagnetic relaxation (T2/T2'), is often prone, however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity. Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus, reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We have examined and quantified in primate prefrontal cortex the subcellular distribution of two isoforms of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, which are components of the signal transduction pathway accessed by the D-1 dopamine receptor. Both PP1 alpha- and PP1 gamma1-labeled puncta are seen in cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and thalamus. Viewed with the electron microscope, both PP1 isoforms are selectively localized to dendritic spines and are found in different percentages of spines; PP1 alpha is present in roughly 70% and PP1 gamma1 in roughly 40% of dendritic spines. Our analysis indicates that three populations of spines are defined by the distribution of these PP1 isoforms: those that contain both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, those that contain only PP1 alpha and those that contain neither. The D-1 receptor is present in a subset of the population that contains both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1. The nonhomogeneous distribution of signal transduction proteins in the spines and dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells may help to explain differences in the actions of receptors that nominally use the same signal-transduction pathway.

Responsiveness within the hand region of the second somatosensory area of cortex (SII) was investigated in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in association with cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the primary somatosensory area, SI. The aims were to determine whether thalamocortical systems in this primate species are organized according to a serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII as the next hierarchical level of processing and to establish whether primates are fundamentally different, in this respect, from mammals in which tactile information is conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII. 2. Inactivation of the SI hand area was achieved when the temperature at the face of the silver cooling block over this SI region was lowered to less than or equal to 13 degrees C. Inactivation was confirmed by abolition of the SI surface potential evoked by a brief tap stimulus to the hand and by the abolition of responsiveness in single SI neurons located beneath and around the edge of the block. 3. The effect of SI inactivation on SII-evoked potentials was investigated in 20 experiments by simultaneous recording of the SI- and SII-evoked potentials. The SII response was never abolished and was unchanged in the majority (12/20) of experiments. In the remainder, the SII-evoked potentials underwent a reduction in amplitude that was usually <30% but never >50%. 4. Tactile responsiveness was examined quantitatively in 47 individual SII neurons of different functional classes before, during, and after the inactivation of SI. Controlled tactile stimuli consisted of trains of sinusoidal vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the glabrous or hairy skin of the hand. 5. Thirteen of the 47 SII neurons (28%) were unaffected in their response levels in association with SI inactivation. The remaining 34 SII neurons underwent some reduction in responsiveness, but in only 6% (3/47) was responsiveness abolished by SI inactivation. As the same range of functional classes of tactile neurons were represented among the affected and unaffected SII neurons, there was no evidence for a differential susceptibility among SII tactile neurons to the effect of SI inactivation. 6. Where reductions in amplitude of the SII-evoked potential or in response levels of SII neurons were observed, the effects were not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SI to the SII hand area as there was no cooling-induced prolongation of either the evoked potential or spike waveform in SII, an effect that is known to precede cooling-induced reductions in responsiveness. 7. These lines of evidence indicate that reductions in SII responsiveness in association with SI inactivation may be attributable to a loss of a background facilitatory influence rather than to a blockage of a component of peripheral input that comes over a putative serial path to SII via SI. First, as SI was cooled, there was a progressive increase in latency and time course of the SI responses before their disappearance, but no comparable delay in the SII responses as might be expected if SI were placed earlier than SII in a strict hierarchical scheme of thalamocortical processing. Second, SI inactivation failed to bring about a tightening in the phase-locking of SII responses to vibrotactile stimuli as might have been expected if the inputs to the SII neurons come via both a direct path from the thalamus and an indirect intracortical path via SI. Blockage of the indirect intracortical pathway through SI might be expected to reduce temporal dispersion in the input to SII neurons and result in an improvement in phase-locking in the SII responses to skin vibration. Third, the background activity of some SII neurons was reduced during SI inactivation along with the reduction in their responses to tactile stimulation. If this background activity is endogenous to SII and not generated by afferent drive that comes via SI, it appears that the inactivation removes a source of background facilitation that arises in SI and affects a proportion of SII neurons. 8. In conclusion, the retention of tactile responsiveness in >90% of marmoset SII neurons in association with SI inactivation demonstrates that within this primate species, tactile inputs can reach SII without traversing an indirect, serially organized path through SI. The results establish that in the marmoset monkey, as in nonprimate species, there is a parallel organization of the SI and Sn areas for tactile processing and therefore necessitate a revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which signals are conveyed from the thalamus to SI, and thence to SII. The results indicate that there is no longer justification for the view that there are fundamental differences between simian primates, in general, and other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems that supply SI and SII.;UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA;University of New South Wales Sydney;;;;;;;;;85;78;78;0;9;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Quantitative evaluation of connections examined with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers indicated that both gyri received strong thalamic projections from the medial geniculate body (MG) and the lateromedial-suprageniculate (LM-Sg) complex, and a weaker projection from the posterior (Po) nuclei. On the basis of the connectivity patterns and cytoarchitectonic features we distinguished the anterior (CPa) and posterior (CPp) areas in posterior composite gyrus and the anterior (SA), dorsal (SD) and posterior (SP) sylvian areas. Afferents from individual thalamic nuclei were focused in distinct areas, forming dominant projections, and diminished gradually in the adjacent areas as non-dominant projections. The most prominent MG projection arose from the dorsal caudal (MGdc) nucleus. Its ventral subdivision sent a dominant projection into the SP and CPa, whereas the dorsal MGdc subdivision was connected with the SA, SD and CPp areas. The most substantial connections from the LM-Sg complex were directed to areas SA, SD and CPp, with weak connections to areas CPa and SP. A gradient of density of LM-Sg afferents was distributed in the opposite direction to that sent from the MGdc. The origin of the CPa and SP afferents in the ventral MGdc, like connections reaching the posterior ectosylvian cortex, suggest that these areas are related to processing of auditory information. In contrast, areas SA and Up, receive dominant projections from the polymodal LM-Sg, and therefore may constitute successive steps in a hierarchy of cortical areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The injections were placed in the forelimb and eye-movement representations of PMD and in the forelimb representation of PMV as determined by microstimulation mapping. For comparison, injections were also placed in the forelimb representation of primary motor cortex (MI) of two owl monkeys. The results indicate that both PMD and PMV receive dense projections from the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus, and sparser projections from the ventromedial (VM), mediodorsal (MD) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. Labeled neurons in VL were concentrated in the anterior (VLa) and the medial (VLx) nuclei, with only a few labeled cells in the dorsal (VLd) and posterior (VLp) nuclei. In VA, labeled neurons were concentrated in the parvocellular division (VApc) dorsomedial to VLa. Labeled neurons in MD were concentrated in the most lateral and posterior parts of the nucleus. VApc projected more densely to PMD than PMV, especially to rostral PMD, whereas caudal PMD received stronger projections from neurons in VLx and VLa. VLd projected exclusively to PMD, and not to PMV. In addition, neurons labeled by PMD injections tended to be more dorsal in VL, IL, and MD than those labeled by PMV injections. The results indicate that both premotor areas receive indirect inputs from the cerebellum (via VLx, VLd and IL) and globus pallidus (via VLa, VApc, and MD). Comparisons of thalamic projections to premotor and M1 indicate that both regions receive strong projections from VLx and VLa, with the populations of cells projecting to M1 located more laterally in these nuclei. VApc, VLd, and MD project mainly to premotor areas, while VLp projects mainly to M1. Overall, the thalamic connectivity patterns of premotor cortex in New World owl monkeys are similar to those reported for Old World monkeys. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the functional roles of this complex remain to be fully elucidated. Here we have examined whether the CM-Pf complex is involved in the process of covert attention. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a task in which a visual target stimulus for button release appeared at either the same location as the preceding visual instruction cue (a validly cued target) or a location on the opposite side (an invalidly cued target). Reaction times (RTs) to a validly cued target were significantly shorter than those to an invalidly cued target, leading to a validity effect of about 20 ms. We recorded the activity of 97 neurons in the CM-Pf while the monkeys performed the attention task with the hand that was contralateral to the neuronal recording. Seventy CM-Pf neurons showed task-related activity after the appearance of either the instruction cue or the target stimulus: 33 neurons responded with a prominent short-latency facilitation (SLF), whereas 37 responded with a short-latency suppression followed by a long-latency facilitation (LLF). Most of the SLF neurons responded preferentially to a cue appearing on the contralateral side (76%) and to an invalidly cued target appearing on the contralateral side (61%). In contrast, LLF neurons showed a short-latency suppression after the cue stimulus, regardless of whether the cue appeared on the contra- or ipsilateral side (84%). Inactivating the CM-Pf complex by local injection (1 mul) of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1-5 mug/mul) resulted in a significant increase in the RT to a validly cued target presented on the contra- but not the ipsilateral side. In contrast, inactivating the CM-Pf complex did not affect RTs to invalidly cued targets on either the contra- or the ipsilateral side. Thus the validity effect was abolished only on the contralateral side. We conclude that the CM-Pf complex plays a specific and essential role in the process of attentional orienting to external events occurring on the contralateral side, probably through the projection of primary outputs to the striatum, which is involved in the action-selection mechanisms of the basal ganglia.;Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine;Kimura, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.;mkimura@basic.kpu-m.ac.jp;"Minamimoto, Takafumi/AAD-8726-2020; Minamimoto, Takafumi/D-6610-2012";"Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174";;;;;59;134;138;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

T(1)-weighted coronal, horizontal, and sagittal MR slices of fixed left cerebral hemispheres were obtained from one male fetus at embryonic days (EDs) 70-150. The timetable for fetal sulcation by MRI was in good agreement with that by gross observations, with a lag time of 10-30 days. A difference in detectability of some sulci seemed to be associated with the length, depth, width, and location of the sulci. Furthermore, MRI clarified the embryonic days of the emergence of the callosal (ED 70) and circular (ED 90) sulci, which remained unpredictable under gross observations. Also made visible by the present MRI were subcortical structures of the forebrain such as the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, major subdivisions of the thalamus, and hippocampal formation. Their adult-like features were formed by ED 100, corresponding to the onset of a signal enhancement in the gray matter, which reflects neuronal maturation. The results reveal a highly reproducible level of gross structural changes in the forebrain using a high spatial 7-tesla MRI. The present MRI study clarified some changes that are difficult to demonstrate nondestructively using only gross observations, for example, the development of cerebral sulci located on the deep portions of the cortex, as well as cortical and subcortical neuronal maturation.;"[Sawada, Kazuhiko] Tsukuba Int Univ, Anat Lab, Dept Phys Therapy, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 3000051, Japan; [Sun, Xue-Zhi] Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Regulat Sci Res Grp, Chiba 2638555, Japan; [Fukunishi, Katsuhiro; Kashima, Masatoshi; Tokado, Hiroshi] Shin Nippon Biomed Labs, Kagoshima 8911394, Japan; [Sakata-Haga, Hiromi; Fukui, Yoshihiro] Univ Tokushima, Dept Anat & Dev Neurobiol, Grad Sch, Inst Hlth Biosci, Tokushima 7708503, Japan; [Aoki, Ichio] Natl Inst Radiol Sci, MR Mol Imaging Team, Mol Imaging Ctr, Chiba 2638555, Japan";"National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology; Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories Ltd.; Tokushima University; National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology";Sawada, K (corresponding author), Tsukuba Int Univ, Anat Lab, Dept Phys Therapy, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Tsuchiura, Ibaraki 3000051, Japan.;k-sawada@tius-hs.jp;"Aoki, Ichio/G-2529-2011; Aoki, Ichio/ABF-7336-2020; Sawada, Kazuhiko/AAV-3923-2020";"Aoki, Ichio/0000-0002-4429-5053; ";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [20590176]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20590176] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (20590176) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

To this day, our understanding of the visual system in mammals beyond the few studied animal models remains limited. In the present study, we examined the primary visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls that live on land (sheep, Pere David deer, giraffe); in the sea (bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, long-finned pilot whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale and fin whale); or in an amphibious environment (hippopotamus). We also sampled and studied the visual cortex of the horse (a closely related perissodactyl) and two primates (chimpanzee and pig-tailed macaque) for comparison. Our histochemical and immunohistochemical results indicate that the visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls is characterized by a peculiar organization, structure, and complexity of the cortical column. We noted a general lesser lamination compared to simians, with diminished density, and an apparent simplification of the intra- and extra-columnar connections. The presence and distribution of calcium-binding proteins indicated a notable absence of parvalbumin in water species and a strong reduction of layer 4, usually enlarged in the striated cortex, seemingly replaced by a more diffuse distribution in neighboring layers. Consequently, thalamo-cortical inputs are apparently directed to the higher layers of the column. Computer analyses and statistical evaluation of the data confirmed the results and indicated a substantial correlation between eye placement and cortical structure, with a markedly segregated pattern in cetaceans compared to other mammals. Furthermore, cetacean species showed several types of cortical lamination which may reflect differences in function, possibly related to depth of foraging and consequent progressive disappearance of light, and increased importance of echolocation.";"[Graic, Jean-Marie; Peruffo, Antonella; Cozzi, Bruno] Univ Padua, Dept Comparat Biomed & Food Sci, Viale Univ 16 Legnaro, I-35020 Padua, PD, Italy; [Corain, Livio] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy; [Finos, Livio] Univ Padua, Dept Dev Psychol & Socializat, Padua, Italy; [Grisan, Enrico] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, Padua, Italy; [Grisan, Enrico] London South Bank Univ, Sch Engn, London SE1 0AA, England";"University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua; University of Padua; London South Bank University";Graic, JM (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Comparat Biomed & Food Sci, Viale Univ 16 Legnaro, I-35020 Padua, PD, Italy.;jeanmarie.graic@unipd.it;"Grisan, Enrico/K-9381-2016; Finos, Livio/AAQ-6411-2020; Graïc, Jean-Marie/I-2710-2019";"Grisan, Enrico/0000-0002-7365-5652; Finos, Livio/0000-0003-3181-8078; Graïc, Jean-Marie/0000-0002-1974-8356; CORAIN, LIVIO/0000-0002-8104-1255; Peruffo, Antonella/0000-0003-0454-9087; Cozzi, Bruno/0000-0002-7531-7040";Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement;Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement;Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.;;175;3;3;1;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

For light microscopic analysis small biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or biocytin injections were placed in midrostral and dorsal portions of inferior parietal lobule (IPL), respectively. The distribution anterograde and retrograde labeling was charted, and representative axons and terminal fields were reconstructed in the sagittal plane to examine their features. Two types of fibers were identified-those of thin diameter forming diffuse terminal fields with small boutons, and thick fibers forming focal terminal fields with large boutons. Area PFG injection of BDA resulted in labeling of both types of fibers in LP, MD, and pulvinar, whereas only fibers of the first type were found in VL. Biocytin injection in area Opt resulted in preferential labeling of large fibers terminating in LP and pulvinar. Further electron microscopic analysis of labeled boutons in VL and LP, following a large wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase injection in the middle of IPL, confirmed the existence of small and large corticothalamic boutons and their different termination sites: the small boutons formed synapses on distal dendrites while the large boutons were found close to somata of thalamocortical projection neurons, on the dendrites of local circuit neurons and in complex synaptic arrangements, such as glomeruli. The results demonstrate that projections from small loci of the PPC to functionally and connectionally different thalamic nuclei differ anatomically, implying a different functional impact on these diverse targets.

However, little is known about possible structural alterations following amputation and chronic loss of afferent input in humans. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), based on high-resolution magnetic resonance images, we investigated the brain structure of 28 volunteers with unilateral limb amputation and compared them to healthy controls. Subjects with limb amputation exhibited a decrease in gray matter of the posterolateral thalamus contralateral to the side of the amputation. The thalamic gray matter differences were positively correlated with the time span after the amputation but not with the frequency or magnitude of coexisting phantom pain. Phantom limb pain was unrelated to thalamic structural variations, but was positively correlated to a decrease in brain areas related to the processing of pain. No gray matter increase was detected. The unilateral thalamic differences may reflect a structural correlate of the loss of afferent input as a secondary change following deafferentation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Despite several studies exploring the somatosensory system of marmosets, all results have come from anesthetized animals using invasive techniques and postmortem analyses. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility for getting high-quality and reproducible somatosensory mapping in awake marmosets with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We acquired fMRI sequences in four animals, while they received tactile stimulation (via air-puffs), delivered to the face, arm, or leg. We found a topographic body representation with the leg representation in the most medial part, the face representation in the most lateral part, and the arm representation between leg and face representation within areas 3a, 3b, and 1/2. A similar sequence from leg to face from caudal to rostral sites was identified in areas S2 and PV. By generating functional connectivity maps of seeds defined in the primary and second somatosensory regions, we identified two clusters of tactile representation within the posterior and midcingulate cortex. However, unlike humans and macaques, no clear somatotopic maps were observed. At the subcortical level, we found a somatotopic body representation in the thalamus and, for the first time in marmosets, in the putamen. These maps have similar organizations, as those previously found in Old World macaque monkeys and humans, suggesting that these subcortical somatotopic organizations were already established before Old and New World primates diverged. Our results show the first whole brain mapping of somatosensory responses acquired in a noninvasive way in awake marmosets. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used somatosensory stimulation combined with functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to reveal the topographic body representation in areas S1, S2, thalamus, and putamen. We showed the existence of a body representation organization within the thalamus and the cingulate cortex by computing functional connectivity maps from seeds defined in S1/S2, using resting-state fMRI data. This noninvasive approach will be essential for chronic studies by guiding invasive recording and manipulation techniques.;"[Clery, Justine C.; Hori, Yuki; Schaeffer, David J.; Gati, Joseph S.; Pruszynski, J.

However, these subdivisions show no correlation with those established by electrophysiological, immunocytochemical, or neuroanatomical tracer studies. In this work, we studied the connections of the pulvinar nucleus of Cebus monkey with visual areas V1, V2, V4, MT, and PO by means of retrograde fluorescent tracers injected into these areas. Based on the projection zones to cortical visual areas, the visual portion of the pulvinar. of Cebus monkey was subdivided into three subregions: P1, P2, and P3, similar to those described in the macaque (Ungerleider ct al., 1984). In Cebus, P1 includes the centrolateral portion of traditionally defined PI and adjacent portion of FL. P? is located in the dorsal portion of PL and P3 includes the medial portion of FI and extends dorsally into adjacent PL and PM. In addition, eve studied the histology of the pulvinar using multiple criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture; histochemistry for cytochrome oxidase, NADPH-diaphorase, and acetylcholinesterase; and immunocytochemistry for two calcium-binding proteins, calbindin and parvalbumin, and for a neurofilament recognized by the SMI-32 antibody. Some of these stains, mainly calbindin, showed additional subdivisions of the Cebus pulvinar, beyond the traditional PI, FL, and PM. Based on this immunohistochemical staining, the border of PI is moved dorsally above the brachium of the superior colliculus and PI can be subdivided in five regions (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PILS). Regions P1, P2, and P3 defined based on efferent connections with cortical visual areas are not architectonically/neurochemically homogeneous. Rather. they appear to consist of further chemoarchitectonic subdivisions.

The goal of the present study was to establish in monkeys whether these subdivisions also differ with regard to their callosal connectivity. Two fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected in each animal, one in the pre-SMA and the second in the SMA-proper. Tracer injections in the pre-SMA or in SMA-proper resulted in significant numbers of labeled neurons in the opposite SMA, premotor cortex (PM), cingulate motor areas (CMA), and cingulate gyrus. Labeled neurons in M1 were rare, being observed only after injection in the SMA-proper. The two subdivisions of the SMA differed in the proportion of labeled neurons found across areas providing their callosal inputs. The SMA-proper receives about half of its callosal inputs from its counterpart in the other hemisphere (42-65% across monkeys). A comparable proportion of neurons was found in the pre-SMA after injection in the opposite pre-SMA (32-47%). The pre-SMA receives more callosal inputs from the rostral halves of the dorsal PM, the ventral PM, and the CMA than from their caudal halves. In addition, the pre-SMA, but not the SMA-proper, receives callosal inputs from the prefrontal cortex. The SMA-proper receives more callosal inputs from the caudal halves of the, dorsal PM and ventral PM than from their rostral halves. The two subdivisions of the SMA receive callosal inputs from the same cortical areas except the prefrontal cortex and M1), but they differ with respect to the quantitative contribution of each area of origin. In conclusion, quantitative data now support the notion that pre-SMA receives more transcallosal inputs than the SMA-proper.J.Comp.Neurol.443:71-85,2002.

Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen, and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior.

Data are entered into the database by drawing injection and label sites from a particular tracer study directly onto canonical representations of the neuroanatomical structures of interest, along with providing descriptive text information. Searches may then be performed on the data by querying the database graphically, for example by specifying a region of interest within the brain for which connectivity information is desired, or via text information, such as keywords describing a particular brain region, or an author name or reference. Analyses may also be performed by accumulating data across multiple studies and displaying a colour-coded map that graphically represents the total evidence for connectivity between regions. Thus, data may be studied and compared free of areal boundaries (which often vary from one laboratory to the next), and instead with respect to standard landmarks, such as the position relative to well-known neuroanatomical substrates or stereotaxic coordinates. If desired, areal boundaries may also be defined by the user to facilitate the interpretation of results. We demonstrate the application of the database to the analysis of pulvinar-cortical connections in the macaque monkey, for which the results of over 120 neuroanatomical experiments were entered into the database.

In cases with small or medium-sized injections in VPL, labeled STT cells were located almost entirely in lamina V (in spinal segments consistent with the mediolateral VPL topography); few cells were labeled in lamina 1 (< 8%) and essentially none in lamina VII. Large and very large injections in VPL produced marked increases in labeling in lamina I, associated first with spread into VPI and next into the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo), and abundant labeling in lamina VII, associated with spread into the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus. Small injections restricted to VPI labeled many STT cells in laminae I and V with an anteroposterior topography. These observations indicate that VPL receives STT input almost entirely from lamina V neurons, whereas VPI receives STT input from both laminae I and V cells, with two different topographic organizations.

However, it is unclear whether the same intervention would be effective for thermal hyperalgesia. Therefore, using the macaque model, we examined behavioural responses to thermal stimuli following pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII. Methods Two CPSP model macaques were established based on collagenase-induced unilateral hemorrhagic lesions in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. To evaluate pain perception, withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 37, 45, 50, 52, and 55 degrees C to hands were measured. Several weeks after the lesion induction, pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII by microinjection of muscimol was performed. The effect of inactivation on withdrawal latency was assessed by comparison with withdrawal latency after vehicle injection. Results Several weeks after induction of the thalamic lesions, both macaques demonstrated a reduction in withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation (<50 degrees C) on the contralesional hand, indicating the occurrence of thermal hyperalgesia. When the PIC/SII were inactivated by muscimol, the withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 50 and 52 degrees C were significantly increased compared to those after vehicle injection. Conclusions Our data emphasize that increased activity in the PIC/SII after appearance of thalamic lesions can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities, and the modulation of PIC/SII activity may be a therapeutic approach for thermal hyperalgesia. Significance CPSP is caused by stroke lesions in the sensory system and characterized by mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia. Inactivation of the PIC/SII has an analgesic effect on mechanical allodynia; however, it is not clear whether the same intervention could reduce thermal hyperalgesia. Here, using the macaque model, we demonstrated that inactivation of these cortices reduces hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli.

Because the reactivation of deprived hand cortex by the face inputs could depend on axonal connections across the hand-face border, we determined the extent of such connections in New World marmosets, owl monkeys, and squirrel monkeys. Small injections of anatomic tracers were placed in the hand or the face representations after these representations were identified by microelectrode recordings. The positions of retrogradely labeled neurons were plotted in processed brain sections cut parallel to the brain surface, and their locations were related to anatomic isomorphs of the hand and face representations revealed in adjacent brain sections stained for myelin. In these sections, the hand-face border was clearly visualized as a myelin-poor septum. The intrinsic connections of area 3b labeled by injections in either the hand or face representations were almost completely confined to their respective representation, and very few neurons projected across the border. In addition, neurons in the somatosensory thalamus labeled by injections in either face or hand representations were confined to either VPM, representing the face, or the hand subnucleus of VPL.

Most, but not all (78%) of the contralateral retrogradely labeled lamina I STT cells were positive for calbindin. Calbindin-immunoreactivity was not selectively associated with any particular anatomical type of lamina I STT cell; 82% of the fusiform cells, 78% of the pyramidal cells and 67% of the multipolar cells were double-labeled. In the second experiment, oblique transverse sections from upper cervical spinal segments of three macaque monkeys, one squirrel monkey and five humans were stained for calbindin-immunoreactivity. In each case, a distinct bundle of fibers was densely stained in the middle of the lateral funiculus. This matches the location of anterogradely labeled ascending lamina I axons observed in prior work in cats and monkeys, and it matches the location of the classically described 'lateral spinothalamic tract' in humans. This bundle had variable shape across cases, an observation that might have clinical significance. These findings support the view that lamina I STT neurons are involved in spinal cordotomies that reduce pain, temperature and itch sensations.

While some memory inadequacies in OSA may result from earlier-described structural deficits in the hippocampus, mammillary body injury also could contribute, since these structures receive projections from the hippocampus via the fornix, project heavily to the anterior thalamus, and have been implicated in other conditions with memory deficiencies, such as Korsakoff's syndrome. However, volume loss in mammillary bodies has not been reported in OSA, likely a consequence of logistic difficulties in size assessment. We evaluated mammillary body volumes in 43 OSA (mean age +/- S.D., 46.9 +/- 9.2 years; mean apnea-hypopnea-index +/- S.D., 31.2 +/- 19.9 events/h) and 66 control subjects (age, 47.3 +/- 8.9 years). Two high-resolution T1-weighted image volumes were collected on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner, averaged to improve signal-to-noise, and reoriented (without warping) into a common space. Brain sections containing both mammillary bodies were oversampled, and the bodies were manually traced and volumes calculated. OSA patients showed significantly reduced left, right, and combined mammillary body volumes compared with control subjects, after partitioning for age, gender, and head size (multivariate linear model, p < 0.05). Left-side mammillary bodies showed greater volume reduction than the right side. Diminished mammillary body volume in OSA patients may be associated with memory and spatial orientation deficits found in the syndrome. The mechanisms contributing to the volume loss are unclear, but may relate to hypoxic/ischemic processes, possibly assisted by nutritional deficiencies in the syndrome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several brain imaging studies among patients with CPSP demonstrate that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this condition is the maladaptive plasticity of pain-related brain regions. However, the temporal profile of the regional plastic changes, as suggested by brain imaging of CPSP patients, as well as their cellular basis, is unknown. To investigate these issues, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical analysis with our established CPSP monkey model. From 8 weeks after a hemorrhagic lesion to the unilateral ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the monkeys exhibited significant behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting allodynia. The present VBM results revealed a decrease in gray matter volume in the pain-related areas after several weeks following the lesion. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining in the ipsilesional posterior insular cortex (ipsi-PIC) and secondary somatosensory cortex (ipsi-SII), where the significant reduction in gray matter volume was observed in the VBM result, displayed a significant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals compared to intact monkeys. Our results suggest that progressive changes in neuronal morphology, including synaptic loss in the ipsi-PIC/SII, are involved in the CPSP.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Bando, Daigo; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat & Interact Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Niigata 9503198, Japan; [Nemoto, Kiyotaka] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan; [Takashima, Ichiro; Bando, Daigo] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Niigata University; University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat & Interact Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Nemoto, Kiyotaka/C-4987-2013; Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016";"Nemoto, Kiyotaka/0000-0001-8623-9829; Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316";"KAKENHI from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17 J03104, 20 K19389, 20H04061]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan [20H05490]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H05490, 20H04061] Funding Source: KAKEN";"KAKENHI from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This work was supported by KAKENHI (Nos. 17 J03104 and 20 K19389 to K.N. and No. 20H04061 to N.H.) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Hyper-adaptability for overcoming body-brain dysfunction: Integrated empirical and system theoretical approaches (No. 20H05490 to N.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan.;;45;4;4;1;10;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at cervical levels in monkeys result in expansion of the intact chin inputs into the deafferented hand representation in area 3b, second somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas of the somatosensory cortex, ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus, and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. Here, we describe the extent and nature of reorganization of the cuneate and gracile nuclei of adult macaque monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns, and compare it with the reorganization of area 3b in the same monkeys. In both, area 3b and the cuneate nucleus chin inputs expand to reactivate the deafferented neurons. However, unlike area 3b, neurons in the cuneate nucleus also acquire receptive fields on the shoulder, neck, and occiput. A comparison with the previously published results shows that reorganization in the cuneate nucleus is similar to that in VPL. Thus, the emergent topography following deafferentations by spinal cord injuries undergoes transformation as the reorganized inputs ascend from subcortical nuclei to area 3b. The results help us understand mechanisms of the brain plasticity following spinal cord injuries.;"[Halder, Priyabrata; Kambi, Niranjan; Chand, Prem; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781; Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India [19-06/2011(i)EU-IV]; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-1]";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Council for Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)";Department of Biotechnology, Government of India to N.J.

In this task the correct, rewarded, response in each scene was to a particular object of a pair, which always occupied a particular position in a unique background which had been generated using randomly chosen colours and shapes. In each session, the monkey learned a new list of these unique scenes. The animals then underwent surgical ablation of either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the cingulate cortex. It was found that the animals with anterior thalamic lesions showed a substantial impairment, whereas the monkeys with cingulate cortex ablations were not significantly impaired at the task. These results confirm the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei in episodic memory, and suggest that the cingulate gyrus is not a region which is crucial in the type of episodic memory task used in the present experiment.

Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors.;"Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832";;;;;99;262;265;0;11;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Transcranial passive cavitation detection (PCD) provides methodology for monitoring the treatment in real time, but the skull effects remain a major challenge for its translation to the clinic. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity, reliability, and limitations of PCD through primate (macaque and human) skulls in vitro. The results were further correlated with the in vivo macaque studies including the transcranial PCD calibration and real-time monitoring of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, with magnetic resonance imaging assessing the opening and safety. The stable cavitation doses using harmonics (SCDh) and ultraharmonics (SCDu), the inertial cavitation dose (ICD), and the cavitation SNR were quantified based on the PCD signals. Results showed that through the macaque skull, the pressure threshold for detecting the SCDh remained the same as without the skull in place, whereas it increased for the SCDu and ICD; through the human skull, it increased for all cavitation doses. The transcranial PCD was found to be reliable both in vitro and in vivo when the transcranial cavitation SNR exceeded the 1-dB detection limit through the in vitro macaque (attenuation: 4.92 dB/mm) and human (attenuation: 7.33 dB/mm) skull. In addition, using long pulses enabled reliable PCD monitoring and facilitate BBB opening at low pressures. The in vivo results showed that the SCDh became detectable at pressures as low as 100 kPa; the ICD became detectable at 250 kPa, although it could occur at lower pressures; and the SCDu became detectable at 700 kPa and was less reliable at lower pressures. Real-time monitoring of PCD was further implemented during BBB opening, with successful and safe opening achieved at 250 to 600 kPa in both the thalamus and the putamen. In conclusion, this study shows that transcranial PCD in macaques in vitro and in vivo, and in humans in vitro, is reliable by improving the cavitation SNR beyond the 1-dB detection limit.";"[Wu, Shih-Ying; Tung, Yao-Sheng; Marquet, Fabrice; Downs, Matthew Eric; Sanchez, Carlos Sierra; Chen, Cherry Chen; Konofagou, Elisa] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Downs, Matthew Eric] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Ferrera, Vincent] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Konofagou, Elisa] Columbia Univ, Dept Radiol, New York, NY USA";"Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University";Wu, SY (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.;ek2191@columbia.edu;;"Downs, Matthew/0000-0001-6115-3156; Ferrera, Vincent/0000-0002-6599-7740";"National Institutes of Health [R01 AG038961, R01 EB009041]; Wallace H.

Here we report the synthesis of a novel PET radioligand, [(11)C]AZ10419369 (5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide), for in vivo visualization of 5-HT1B receptors in the brains of macaques and humans subjects. [(11)C]AZ10419369 was prepared by N-methylation of (8-(1-piperazinyl)5- methylchrom-2-en-4-one-2-(4-morpholinophenyl) carboxamide, using carbon-11 methyl triflate. Regional brain uptake patterns of [(11)C]AZ10419369 were characterized by PET measurements in two macaques and a preliminary study in two human subjects. In addition, AZ10419369 was prepared in tritium labeled form for in vitro autoradiography studies in macaque brain tissue sections. The radiochemical purity of [(11)C]AZ10419369 was >99% and specific radioactivity was >3600 Ci/ mmol. After iv injection of [(11)C]AZ10419369, 3-4% was in brain after 7.5 min. The regional brain distribution of radioactivity was similar in humans and macaques showing the highest uptake of radioactivity in the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia, in accord with autoradiographic studies performed using [(3)H]AZ10419369. Uptake was moderate in the temporal and frontal cortical regions, lower in the thalamus and lowest in the cerebellum. In macaques pre-treated with the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist, AR-A000002, binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with specific binding to 5-HT(1B) receptors. These data support [11C] AZ10419369 as a suitable radioligand for labeling 5-HT(1B) receptors in the primate brain. This radioligand may be useful in future studies evaluating drug-induced receptor occupancy and measurement of brain 5-HT1B receptor levels in patients with psychiatric disorders.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the existence of this projection could be confirmed unambiguously using electrophysiological methods and, if so, to determine the response characteristics of primate spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons. Fifteen neurons in the lumbar enlargement of macaque monkeys were antidromically activated using low-amplitude current pulses in the contralateral hypothalamus. The points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were found in the supraoptic decussation (n = 13) or in the medial hypothalamus (n = 2). Recording points were located in the superficial dorsal horn (n = 1), deep dorsal horn (n = 10), and intermediate zone (n = 4). Each of the 12 examined neurons had cutaneous receptive fields on the ipsilateral hindlimb. All neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli, suggesting that the transmission of nociceptive information is an important role of primate SHT axons. Twelve SHT neurons were also antidromically activated from the thalamus. Tn all cases, the antidromic latency from the thalamus was shorter than that from the hypothalamus, suggesting that the axons pass through the thalamus then enter the hypothalamus. These results confirm the existence of a SHT in primates and suggest that this projection may contribute to the production of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and emotional responses to noxious stimuli in primates, possibly including humans.;"Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Grad Program Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";Giesler, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Cell Biol & Neuroanat, 4-102 Owre Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;;;;"NIDA NIH HHS [DA-09641] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCR NIH HHS [DE-07288] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-25932] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIDCR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;16;17;17;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

In macaques and cats, for example, preferred orientations of neurons are organized in a specific pattern, where cells with similar selectivity are clustered in iso-orientation domains. However, the map is not always continuous, and there are pinwheel-like singularities around which all orientations are arranged in an orderly fashion. Although subject of intense investigation for half a century now, it is still not entirely clear how these maps emerge and what function they might serve. Here, we suggest a new model of orientation selectivity that combines the geometry and statistics of clustered thalamocortical afferents to explain the emergence of orientation maps. We show that the model can generate spatial patterns of orientation selectivity closely resembling the maps found in cats or monkeys. Without any additional assumptions, we further show that the pattern of ocular dominance columns is inherently connected to the spatial pattern of orientation.;"[Sadeh, Sadra; Rotter, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany";University of Freiburg;Rotter, S (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Bernstein Ctr Freiburg, Fac Biol, Hansastr 9a, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.;"sadra.sadeh@bcf.uni-freiburg.de; stefan.rotter@biologie.uni-freiburg.de";;Sadeh, Sadra/0000-0001-8159-5461;"German Ministry of Education and Research (BCCN Freiburg) [01GQ0420]; German Ministry of Education and Research (BFNT Freiburg*Tubingen) [01GQ0830]";"German Ministry of Education and Research (BCCN Freiburg); German Ministry of Education and Research (BFNT Freiburg*Tubingen)";We thank Almut Schutz for her constructive comments on previous versions of our manuscript.

In neocortex and other laminated structures, a simplified, one-dimensional CSD analysis can be computed by differentiation of voltages sampled at discrete points in a linear array. One-dimensional CSD analysis is a practical and accurate method for defining both regional activity patterns and neural generators of surface-recorded evoked and event-related potentials. In computing the CSD, common practices of differentiating across spatial grids of 200 mum or more and use of spatial smoothing routines help to reduce noise, but severely limit the spatial resolution available to the analysis. High-resolution CSD procedures (i.e., 3 point differentiation using a spatial grid of 100 mum or less) are more suited to identification of processes within individual cortical laminae or sublaminae, but can magnify the contributions of computational artifacts. Despite the inclusion of independent indices of cellular activity (e.g., multiunit activity), both high- and low-resolution analyses may indicate current source and sink configurations for which there is more than one plausible physiological interpretation. In the present study we examined the resolving capacity and pitfalls of common CSD procedures using simulated ensembles of current dipoles. These were positioned and oriented to model the depolarization of lamina 4C stellate cells and thalamocortical afferents in macaque striate cortex. Empirically, the surface N40 appears in association with a CSD configuration which includes current sinks within the thalamorecipient (stellate) subdivisions of lamina 4C and a large current source extending considerably below 4C. Dipole ensemble contributions to the CSD profile were computed and compared to physiological data from this region. Small asymmetries in activation of model stellate laminae were sufficient to produce substantial open field contributions. However, the best fit with empirical CSD profile was found when the simulation included contributions from thalamocortical axons, along with both open and closed field contributions from dual stellate cell sublaminae. High-resolution CSD profiles were shown to be interpretable when computational artifacts characteristic of closed and open fields were identified using a series of differentiation grids.;"YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROSCI,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,BRONX,NY 10461; YESHIVA UNIV ALBERT EINSTEIN COLL MED,DEPT PEDIAT,BRONX,NY 10461";"Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine";TENKE, CE (corresponding author), NYS,INST PSYCHIAT,DEPT BIOPSYCHOL,BOX 50,722 W168 ST,NEW YORK,NY 10032, USA.;;;Tenke, Craig/0000-0002-0924-4314;NIMH NIH HHS [NIMH MH06723, NIMH MH36295] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;33;61;61;0;6;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

The local-global paradigm dissociates two hierarchical levels of auditory predictive coding by examining the brain responses to first-order (local) and second-order (global) sequence violations. Using the macaque model, we previously demonstrated that, in the awake state, local violations cause focal auditory responses while global violations activate a brain circuit comprising prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices. Here we used the same local-global auditory paradigm to clarify the encoding of the hierarchical auditory regularities in anesthetized monkeys and compared their brain responses to those obtained in the awake state as measured with fMRI. Both, propofol, a GABAA-agonist, and ketamine, an NMDA-antagonist, left intact or even enhanced the cortical response to auditory inputs. The local effect vanished during propofol anesthesia and shifted spatially during ketamine anesthesia compared with wakefulness. Under increasing levels of propofol, we observed a progressive disorganization of the global effect in prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices and its complete suppression under ketamine anesthesia. Anesthesia also suppressed thalamic activations to the global effect. These results suggest that anesthesia preserves initial auditory processing, but disturbs both short-term and long-term auditory predictive coding mechanisms. The disorganization of auditory novelty processing under anesthesia relates to a loss of thalamic responses to novelty and to a disruption of higher-order functional cortical networks in parietal, prefrontal and cingular cortices.

The area of taste cortex was first identified physiologically in all the monkeys used in this anatomical study. The four injections into the middle and posterior part of this region resulted in large numbers of labelled cell bodies in the insular-opercular primary taste cortex. Following the two more anterior injections, label was found predominantly in the caudal part of the cardolateral orbitofrontal cortex itself. None of the injections resulted in labelled cells in the gustatory thalamic nucleus ventralis posterior medialis, pars parvocellularis, although all injections resulted in label of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Afferents were also seen from more anterior parts of the orbitofrontal taste cortex, which may represent backprojections from subsequent taste areas.

Although the anatomical and functional organization of the pulvinar has been extensively studied in old and new world monkeys, little is known about the organization of the human pulvinar. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, we identified two visual field maps within the ventral pulvinar, referred to as vPul1 and vPul2. Both maps contain an inversion of contralateral visual space with the upper visual field represented ventrally and the lower visual field represented dorsally. vPul1 and vPul2 border each other at the vertical meridian and share a representation of foveal space with iso-eccentricity lines extending across areal borders. Additional, coarse representations of contralateral visual space were identified within ventral medial and dorsal lateral portions of the pulvinar. Connectivity analyses on functional and diffusion imaging data revealed a strong distinction in thalamocortical connectivity between the dorsal and ventral pulvinar. The two maps in the ventral pulvinar were most strongly connected with early and extrastriate visual areas. Given the shared eccentricity representationandsimilarity in cortical connectivity, we propose that these two maps form a distinct visual field map cluster and perform related functions. The dorsal pulvinar was most strongly connected with parietal and frontal areas. The functional and anatomical organization observed within the human pulvinar was similar to the organization of the pulvinar in other primate species.;"Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University";Arcaro, MJ (corresponding author), Princeton Neurosci Inst, Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;marcaro@princeton.edu;Arcaro, Michael/H-8964-2019;"Arcaro, Michael/0000-0002-4612-9921; Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X";"National Institutes of Health [R01MH-064043, R01EY-017699, T90DA-022763]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1328270] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01MH-064043, R01EY-017699, and T90DA-022763.

Based on the known anatomical connectivity of hierarchically organized visual cortical areas and electrophysiological measurements of LFP interactions, a framework for interareal frequency-specific communication has emerged. Our goals were to test the predictions of this framework in the context of the early visual pathways and to understand how attention modulates communication between the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex. We recorded LFPs simultaneously in retinotopically aligned regions of the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex in alert and behaving macaque monkeys trained on a contrast-change detection task requiring covert shifts in visual spatial attention. Coherence and Granger-causal interactions among early visual circuits varied dynamically over different trial periods. Attention significantly enhanced alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency interactions, often in a manner consistent with the known anatomy of early visual circuits. However, attentional modulation of communication among early visual circuits was not consistent with a simple static framework in which distinct frequency bands convey directed inputs. Instead, neuronal network interactions in early visual circuits were flexible and dynamic. perhaps reflecting task-related shifts in attention. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Attention alters the way we perceive the visual world. For example, attention can modulate how visual information is communicated between the thalamus and cortex. We recorded local field potentials simultaneously in the visual thalamus and cortex to quantify the impact of attention on visual information communication. We found that attentional modulation of visual information communication was not static, but dynamic over the time course of trials.;"[Mock, Vanessa L.] Dartmouth Coll, Program Expt & Mol Med, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Mock, Vanessa L.; Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Luke, Kimberly L.; Hembrook-Short, Jacqueline R.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol Dept, Lebanon, NH USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA";"Dartmouth College; University of Rochester; Dartmouth College; University of Rochester; University of Rochester; University of Rochester";Briggs, F (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;farran_briggs@urmc.rochester.edu;;"Hembrook-Short, Jacqueline/0000-0002-4516-4135; Briggs, Farran/0000-0002-4037-4731";"National Eye Institute [EY-018683, EY-013588, EY-025219, EY-023165]; National Science Foundation [EPSCoR 1632738]; Whitehall Foundation; Hitchcock Foundation; Graduate Fellowship from the Albert J.

What is the spatial scale of sleep rhythms? To answer this question, we adapted deep learning algorithms initially developed for detecting earthquakes and gravitational waves in high-noise settings for analysis of neural recordings in sleep. We then studied sleep spindles in non-human primate electrocorticography (ECoG), human electroencephalogram (EEG), and clinical intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings in the human. Within each recording type, we find widespread spindles occur much more frequently than previously reported. We then analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of these large-scale, multi-area spindles and, in the EEG recordings, how spindle patterns change following a visual memory task.

Macaque pulvinar includes two subregions that are connected to the visual cortex and are retinotopically organized, but the organizing principles of the visual portions of the human pulvinar are unknown. We employed two tasks to address the question of whether human pulvinar exhibits spatial organization using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The first was a global-motion discrimination with a rich visual stimulus and the second a luminance-discrimination task of similar difficulty that used a minimal visual stimulus. Both tasks required central fixation and covert peripheral attention. A group analysis of blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses elicited in the motion-discrimination task revealed activity bilaterally in the ventral pulvinar (z = 2 in Talairach space). Clear position specificity was observed with activity elicited only by contralateral stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli caused suppression. This locus of activity is distinct from the more dorsal (z = 10) region of the pulvinar that has previously been reported to be visually responsive but not retinotopic. In the luminance-discrimination task, similar activity was seen, but it was weaker and detectable only in the left pulvinar. In additional experiments with no task, passively viewed global-motion stimuli also activated the ventral pulvinar bilaterally. Our results show for the first time a distinct, bilateral visual representation in human inferior pulvinar that appears to be contralaterally organized.;Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England;"University of London; Royal Holloway University London";Smith, AT (corresponding author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Dept Psychol, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.;a.t.smith@rhul.ac.uk;;Smith, Andrew T/0000-0002-4751-6253;;;;;38;39;39;0;5;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

These zones are at the origin of parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical subloops involved in modulating the cortical motor output. However, it is still largely unknown how parietal and prefrontal areas, connected to premotor areas, and involved in controlling higher order aspects of motor control, project to the basal ganglia. Based on tracer injections at the cortical level, we analyzed the corticostriatal projections of the macaque hand-related ventrolateral prefrontal, ventral premotor, and inferior parietal areas forming a network for controlling purposeful hand actions (lateral grasping network). The results provided evidence for partial overlap or interweaving of these projections in correspondence of 2 putaminal zones, distinct from the motor putamen, one located just rostral to the anterior commissure, the other in the caudal and ventral part. Thus, the present data provide evidence for partial overlap or interweaving in specific striatal zones (input channels) of projections from multiple, even remote, areas taking part in a large-scale functionally specialized cortical network. Furthermore, they suggest the presence of multiple hand-related input channels, possibly differentially involved in controlling goal-directed hand actions.;"[Gerbella, Marzio; Borra, Elena; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Gerbella, Marzio] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Brain Ctr Social & Motor Cognit, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Mangiaracina, Chiara] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Biomed Biotecnol & Traslaz SBiBi, I-43100 Parma, Italy";"University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Parma";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016";"Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2010MEFNF7_005]; European Commission [FP7-250013]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission(European Commission Joint Research Centre); Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)";The work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (grant number: PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005), European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013, and Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11.;;76;29;30;1;3;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

In slow-wave sleep, spindles (7-16 Hz) are a prominent spontaneous oscillation generated by thalamic circuits and triggered by cortical slow waves. In wakefulness and under anesthesia, brief peripheral sensory stimuli can evoke 10-Hz reverberations due potentially to similar thalamic mechanisms. Functionally, sleep spindles and peripherally evoked spindles may play a role in memory consolidation and perception, respectively. Yet, rarely have the circuits involved in these two rhythms been compared in the same animals and never in primates. Here, we investigated the entrainment of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons to both rhythms in ketamine-sedated macaques. First, we compared spontaneous spindles in sedation and natural sleep to validate the model. Then, we quantified entrainment with spike-field coherence and phase-locking statistics. We found that S1 neurons entrained to spontaneous sleep spindles were also entrained to the evoked spindles, although entrainment strength and phase systematically differed. Our results indicate that the spindle oscillations triggered by top-down spontaneous cortical activity and bottom-up peripheral input share a common cortical substrate. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Brief sensory stimuli evoke 10-Hz oscillations in thalamocortical neuronal activity and in perceptual thresholds. The mechanisms underlying this evoked rhythm are not well understood but are thought to be similar to those generating sleep spindles. We directly compared the entrainment of cortical neurons to both spontaneous spindles and peripherally evoked oscillations in sedated monkeys. We found that the entrainment strengths to each rhythm were positively correlated, although with differing entrainment phases, implying involvement of similar networks.;"[Sritharan, Srihari Y.; Contreras-Hernandez, Enrique; Richardson, Andrew G.; Lucas, Timothy H.] Univ Penn, Ctr Neuroengn & Therapeut, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine";Richardson, AG (corresponding author), Univ Penn, 175A Stemmler Mall,3450 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;andrew.richardson@pennmedicine.upenn.edu;Richardson, Andrew G./AAI-1645-2020;Richardson, Andrew G./0000-0002-4752-3867;National Science Foundation [CBET-1404041];National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF));This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant CBET-1404041.;;66;5;5;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Tracers were visualized using standard immunohistochemistry or evaluated in vivo using manganese (Mn2+) as an MRI paramagnetic tracer. The in vivo tract tracing turned out to be very sensitive with a high correspondence to the histological labelling. Tracers injected into the mediodorsal thalamus labelled the medial and rostral pole of the frontal lobe as well as the anterior cingulate, anterior insular and dorsomedial frontal cortices. Subsequently, the reciprocity and specificity of these connections were tested from injections into the traced frontal cortices indicating that the PFC has cortical connections to different parts of the MD nucleus. Although the granular layer IV, characteristic of primate PFC could not be identified, both cytoarchitectonic and connectional data suggests that the Gottingen minipig has a structurally divided prefrontal cortex. Stereological estimates of PFC volume showed that the Gottingen minipig PFC constitutes about 24% of the total neocortex volume and 10% of the total brain volume. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Various mechanisms, including divergence of preexisting connections, expression of latent synapses, and sprouting of new synapses, have been proposed to explain such phenomena, which probably underlie altered sensory experiences associated with limb amputation and peripheral nerve injury in humans. Putative cortical mechanisms have received the greatest emphasis but there is increasing evidence for substantial reorganization in subcortical structures, including the brainstem and thalamus, that may be of sufficient extent to account for or play a large part in representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex. Recent studies show that divergence of ascending connections is considerable and sufficient to ensure that small alterations in map topography at brainstem and thalamic levels will be amplified in the projection to the cortex. In the long term, slow, deafferentation-dependent transneuronal atrophy at brainstem, thalamic, and even cortical levels are operational in promoting reorganizational changes, and the extent to which surviving connections can maintain a map is a key to understanding differences between central and peripheral deafferentation.;Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA;"University of California System; University of California Davis";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS21377] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;169;263;271;2;18;ANNUAL REVIEWS;PALO ALTO;4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA;0147-006X;1545-4126;;ANNU REV NEUROSCI;Annu.

A total of 23 subjects participated in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Liquid stimuli were presented at supra-threshold concentrations and delivered by means of a computer controlled gustometer. Left and right sides of the mouth were stimulated separately in order to correlate statistical parametrical maps to both the site of the stimulus and the specific taste quality. Following the effects of the site of stimulation through primary and secondary gustatory cortices an effort was made to explore the laterality of the gustatory pathways. Our results showed for both tastants a predominance of ipsilateral connections at the thalamus level. Insula left and right regions were both involved for both tastants. In these regions we found a high proportion of ipsilateral connection again for both the tastants. Considering orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex, left-sided stimulation with NaCl or MSG produced left-sided activation of the orbito-frontal cortex clearly indicating the presence of an ipsilateral path. Finally, the hypothesis of frontal operculum as primary gustatory cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex as secondary was also supported by the results from dynamic causal modeling.

The parvalbumin pathway, ascending from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, is the more direct and terminates in the ventral nucleus. The calbindin pathway is more diffuse in its origins and terminates in the dorsal and medial nuclei. Ventral nucleus neurons are sharply tuned, tonotopically organized and consistent in their responses. They project to core areas of the auditory cortex characterized by high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and by similar neuronal properties. Neurons in the dorsal and medial nuclei are not frequency specific or tonotopic and are labile in their responses. They project more diffusely to belt areas of the auditory cortex in which parvalbumin immunoreactivity is reduced and in which neuronal responses are less specific than in the core. The belt areas are the origins of streams of corticocortical connections leading into the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes.

TrkC-like immunoreactivity was widespread and consisted primarily of varicose fibers. The most dense populations of fibers were in the basal forebrain (in the cholinergic cell groups Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4), in the raphe complex throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and in the locus coeruleus. Other fibers were present in the thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray matter of the midbrain, dorsal midline of the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The only neuronal cell bodies with consistent labeling were located in the lateral hypothalamus. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum showed variable labeling. Specific labeling of varicosities and cell bodies was abolished by omission of the primary antiserum or by preabsorption with the TrkC peptide antigen. We conclude that TrkC-like immunoreactivity can be detected in a wide variety of subcortical locations in the adult rhesus monkey. Labeling was particularly prominent in the vicinity of the major cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic nuclei, known from other studies to be vulnerable in the ageing brain. This suggests that the ligand for TrkC, neurotrophin-3, may persist as a survival factor for critical neurons into adulthood. (C) 1998 IBRO.

It is highly developed in human and nonhuman primates, but its origin, mode, and dynamics of development, resolution, and eventual extinction are not well understood because human postmortem tissue offers only static descriptive data, and mice cannot serve as an adequate experimental model for the distinct regional differences in primates. Here, we take advantage of the large and slowly developing SP in macaque monkey to examine the origin, settling pattern, and subsequent dispersion of the SP neurons in primates. Monkey embryos exposed to the radioactive DNA replication marker tritiated thymidine ([H-3]dT, or TdR) at early embryonic ages were killed at different intervals postinjection to follow postmitotic cells' positional changes. As expected in primates, most SP neurons generated in the ventricular zone initially migrate radially, together with prospective layer 6 neurons. Surprisingly, mostly during midgestation, SP cells become secondarily displaced and widespread into the expanding SP zone, which becomes particularly wide subjacent to the association cortical areas and underneath the summit of its folia. We found that invasion of monoamine, basal forebrain, thalamocortical, and corticocortical axons is mainly responsible for this region-dependent passive dispersion of the SP cells. Histologic and immunohistochemical comparison with the human SP at corresponding fetal ages indicates that the same developmental events occur in both primate species.;"[Duque, Alvaro; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Duque, Alvaro; Rakic, Pasko] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Krsnik, Zeljka; Kostovic, Ivica] Univ Zagreb, Sch Med, Croatian Inst Brain Res, Zagreb 10000, Croatia";"Yale University; Yale University; University of Zagreb";"Rakic, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.;Rakic, P (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Kavli Inst Neurosci, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.";pasko.rakic@yale.edu;Krsnik, Zeljka/AAI-2999-2020;Krsnik, Zeljka/0000-0001-5238-6820;"NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse [R01-DA023999]; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01-NS014841]; NIH/National Eye Institute [R01-EY002593]; Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University; Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost)";"NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NIH/National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University; Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost)";This work was supported by grants from the NIH/National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01-DA023999), NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01-NS014841), NIH/National Eye Institute (R01-EY002593), and Kavli Institute for Neuroscience at Yale University (to P.R.), as well as a Croatian Science Foundation Award HRZZ (Hrvatska zaklada za znanost) (to I.K.).;;26;71;71;0;6;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Forty individual axons were analyzed by serial section reconstruction and divided into two major groups. The majority of axons have numerous (typically 500-1,000) small, spinous endings (boutons terminaux). These axons have terminal fields that are beam-like or elongated (E, corresponding to classical type 1) and highly divergent (1.0-3.0 mm). These frequently innervate several of the traditionally designated pulvinar subdivisions; namely inferior pulvinar (PI) and the ventral part of interal pulvinar (PL); medial pulvinar (PM) and dorsal FL, and (one axon) PM, dorsal FL, and PI. Some axons, however (R or round, corresponding to classical type 2), have a small number (typically 70-160) of primarily large, beaded endings (boutons en passant), which concentrate in sharply delimited, round arbors (diameters 100-125 mu m). R axons appear to be larger caliber than E axons (1.0-1.5 mu m vs. 0.5-1.0 mu m, respectively). These differences in phenotype are probably associated with distinct types of projection neurons. In visual areas, corticopulvinar terminations are reported to originate from pyramidal cell subpopulations in layer 5. Indirect evidence, presented here, suggests that the more numerous medium-sized neurons give rise to E axons, and the sparser giant pyramids give rise to R corticopulvinar axons. If this is correct, corticopulvinar connectivity may be involved in multiple transformations. Spatially, axons of giant neurons (with basal dendrites that collect intracortically from a disc-like area, about 1.0 mm in diameter) converge onto a small number of pulvinar neurons. Axons of medium neurons (with basal dendrites that occupy a small intracortical disc, about 0.3 mm in diameter) diverge over 1.0-3.0 mm in the pulvinar and may form many contacts. Giant neurons, although numerically few in relation to medium pyramids (1 or 2: 50?), are likely to have distinctive membrane properties (functionally equivalent to bursting neurons?). Their larger boutons and axon caliber may be associated with a faster transmission that compensates for their small numbers. In primates, the E and R duality does not characterize cortical projections to the caudate, lateral geniculate nucleus, pens, or superior colliculus and thus may be essentially linked to pulvinar-specific processes.

However, the actual function of these large nuclei of the thalamus remains unknown. In contrast to the nearby lateral geniculate nucleus, the LP-P complex does not receive any substantial direct projections from the retina. Its main visual inputs come from the mesencephalon and the neocortex. Most cells in the LP-P complex behave like cortical units. They are tuned to the orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies of the visual stimulus. In addition, most units are binocular and sensitive to relative retinal disparity. Despite their multiple inputs, the LP-P complex cells form an homogeneous population and their overall properties do not reflect those of a given cortical or subcortical area. On the basis of its afferent and efferent connectivity, it has been proposed that the LP-P complex may serve as a relay of an extrageniculate ascendant pathway which originates from the superior colliculus, and/or provide another route for the geniculo-striate input to reach the extrastriate areas. Despite the fact that there is some electro-physiological evidence of such functions, it is now often suggested that the LP-P complex may integrate its multiple inputs and be involved in functions which go beyond those of a simple thalamic relay. Recent findings suggest that the LP-P complex might play a role in visual spatial attention.;"UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT BIOL, MONTREAL H3C 3J7, QUEBEC, CANADA; HOP ST ANTOINE, DEPT OPHTALMOL, F-75571 PARIS 12, FRANCE";"Universite de Montreal; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP";CASANOVA, C (corresponding author), UNIV SHERBROOKE, FAC MED, DEPT OPHTALMOL, SHERBROOKE J1H 5N4, QUEBEC, CANADA.;;;;;;;;151;11;11;0;1;MASSON EDITEUR;MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9;21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE;0021-7948;;;J PHYSIOLOGY PARIS;;;1991;85;1;;;;;44;57;;;;;;14;Physiology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Physiology;GC265;1941643;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1991GC26500006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this study was to compare the effective connectivity of dorsal pulvinar (dPul) and LIP and to probe the dependency of microstimulation effects on task demands and spatial tuning properties of a given brain region. To this end, we applied unilateral electrical microstimulation in the dPul (mainly medial pulvinar) and LIP in combination with event-related BOLD fMRI in monkeys performing fixation and memory-guided saccade tasks. Microstimulation in both dPul and LIP enhanced task-related activity in monosynaptically-connected frontoparietal cortex and along the superior temporal sulcus (STS) including putative face patch locations, as well as in extrastriate cortex. LIP microstimulation elicited strong activity in the opposite homotopic LIP while no homotopic activation was found with dPul stimulation. Both dPul and LIP stimulation also elicited activity in several heterotopic cortical areas in the opposite hemisphere, implying polysynaptic propagation of excitation. Despite extensive activation along the intraparietal sulcus evoked by LIP stimulation, there was a difference in frontal and occipital connectivity elicited by posterior and anterior LIP stimulation sites. Comparison of dPul stimulation with the adjacent but functionally dissimilar ventral pulvinar also showed distinct connectivity. On the level of single trial timecourses within each region of interest (ROI), most ROIs did not show task-dependence of stimulation-elicited response modulation. Across ROIs, however, there was an interaction between task and stimulation, and task-specific correlations between the initial spatial selectivity and the magnitude of stimulation effect were observed. Consequently, stimulation-elicited modulation of task-related activity was best fitted by an additive model scaled down by the initial response amplitude. In summary, we identified overlapping and distinct patterns of thalamocortical and corticocortical connectivity of pulvinar and LIP, highlighting the dorsal bank and fundus of STS as a prominent node of shared circuitry. Spatial task-specific and partly polysynaptic modulations of cue and saccade planning delay period activity in both hemispheres exerted by unilateral pulvinar and parietal stimulation provide insight into the distributed interhemispheric processing underlying spatial behavior.;"[Kagan, Igor; Gibson, Lydia; Spanou, Elena; Wilke, Melanie] Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Cognit Neurosci Lab, Decis & Awareness Grp, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kagan, Igor; Gibson, Lydia; Wilke, Melanie] Univ Goettingen, Dept Cognit Neurol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Kagan, Igor; Wilke, Melanie] Leibniz Sci Campus Primate Cognit, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany";"Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ); University of Gottingen";Kagan, I (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Cognit Neurosci Lab, Decis & Awareness Grp, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.;ikagan@dpz.eu;spanou, elena/D-7411-2017;Wilke, Melanie/0000-0002-2883-6593;"Hermann and Lilly Schilling Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG) [WI 4046/1-1, GA1475-B4, KA 3726/2-1]; Primate Platform of the DFG Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain (CNMPB)";"Hermann and Lilly Schilling Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Primate Platform of the DFG Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain (CNMPB)";This research was supported by the Hermann and Lilly Schilling Foundation, German Research Foundation (DFG) grants WI 4046/1-1 and Research Unit GA1475-B4, KA 3726/2-1, and the Primate Platform of the DFG Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain (CNMPB).;;138;4;4;2;4;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;Oct 15;2021;240;;;;;;;;118283;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118283;;Jul 21;27;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";UM5HI;34147628;Green Submitted, gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000693361400009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Injections were placed in either the crest of the precentral gyrus or the rostral bank of the central sulcus. The sites for injection in the sulcus were determined by using intracortical stimulation to map the location of hand representation. We found that the precentral gyrus and central sulcus receive their predominant input from different subdivisions of the ventrolateral thalamus. Ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation on the gyrus. In contrast, Ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation in the sulcus. Prior studies have shown that VPLo is a major site of termination of cerebellar efferents and that VLo is a major site of termination of pallidal efferents. Thus, our results indicate that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum directly influence the hand representation of the primary motor cortex.;"VET ADM MED CTR, RES SERV 151, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT PHYSIOL, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT NEUROSURG, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA";"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";;;;Holsapple, James/0000-0003-0419-4474;PHS HHS [24328, 02957, 843902] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;69;136;137;0;5;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

To test this hypothesis in the macaque monkey, we used a subtype-specific antibody to the m2 muscarinic receptor. Immunoreactive cells were well visualized in the nucleus basalis, where some of these cells displayed dense m2 immunoreactivity, while others were lightly labeled. This heterogeneity of labeling intensity was not based on peculiarities of the methodology, because cholinergic cells of the striatum expressed uniformly dense m2 immunoreactivity. Concurrent labeling with choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity proved that most of the heavily m2-labeled cells in the nucleus basalis were also choline acetyltransferase positive. The Endings demonstrate that at least 10-25% of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of the monkey are densely m2 immunoreactive. In the striatum, concurrent labeling demonstrated that the majority, if not all, choline acetyltransferase-positive cells also contained m2 immunoreactivity. In addition, these experiments identified a population of smaller striatal cells which were m2 immunoreactive and choline acetyltransferase negative. Consecutive labeling with m2 immunoreactivity and NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry demonstrated that many of these m2-immunoreactive non-cholinergic neurons belonged to the population of nitric oxide-synthesizing medium aspiny neurons. The findings indicate that the m2 muscarinic receptor may be expressed at high levels in only a subset of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. In contrast, m2 receptors appear to be expressed by all cholinergic cells of the striatum. (C) 1999 IBRO.

Here, we have newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and medical research using marmosets. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Previous experiments have indicated that the periodicity of these columns can be influenced by visual experience: compared to normally raised animals both strabismic cats and cats raised with alternating monocular exposure displayed an increased spacing of adjacent ocular dominance columns in the primary visual cortex (area 17). However, recently it was shown that the formation of ocular dominance columns begins much earlier than previously supposed, indicating that early visual experience might only have a limited influence on the development of the spatial pattern of ocular dominance columns. We therefore visualized the complete pattern of ocular dominance columns in area 17 of normally raised and strabismic kittens during early postnatal development (age 3-6 weeks), particularly focussing on littermates. In addition, we used a previously developed spatial analysis (period statistics) to quantify columnar spacing two-dimensionally. We observed a pronounced interindividual variability in both normally raised and strabismic animals, with column spacings ranging from 783 to 1362 mum. In contrast to previous reports, there were no significant differences in columnar periodicity between normally raised and strabismic cats. These data indicate that rearing has less influence on column spacing while the interindividual variability is much greater than previously supposed, suggesting that genetic differences have an influence on column spacing.;"Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Forschergrp Visuelle Entwicklung & Plast, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany; Max Planck Inst Hirnforsch, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany";"Leibniz Institut fur Neurobiologie (LIN); Max Planck Society";Lowel, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Forschergrp Visuelle Entwicklung & Plast, Brenneckestr 6, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany.;loewel@ifn-magdeburg.de;;;;;;;46;9;11;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

A fundamental issue concerns the roles that thalamocortical input and intracortical connectivity play in generating the activities. Here we addressed this issue in guinea pigs using in vivo and in vitro real-time optical imaging techniques. As reported previously, tone-evoked activity propagated dorsoventrally along a strip (an IS) in AI. We found that an electrical pulse applied focally within the strip, triggered activity propagation with a spatiotemporal pattern highly similar to tone-evoked activation. The propagation velocity of electrically evoked activity was significantly slower than that of tone-evoked activity, but was comparable to the velocity of lateral activity propagation in cortical slices, suggesting that the electrically evoked activity propagation in vivo is mediated by intracortical circuits. To test this notion, we lesioned the auditory thalamus chemically; in such animals, electrically evoked activity in AI was not affected, although tone-evoked activity was abolished. Further, in slices of the AI, the extent of electrically evoked activity propagation in layer II/III was significantly larger in coronal slices than in horizontal slices.

Large injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase or small injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were made in the medial geniculate complex of Macaca fuscata. The terminal distributions of labeled axons in the cortex were correlated with auditory cortical fields demonstrable by different intensities of immunoreactivity for parvalbumin. Fibers from the ventral nucleus terminated mainly in layer TV and deep portion of layer III (IIIB), with additional terminations in layers I-IIIA and in layer VI. In layers IIIB-IV, a major terminal plexus was formed by a small number of dense patches, 300-500 mu m in diameter, surrounded by smaller satellite patches. The patches conformed to a similarly lobulated pattern of parvalbumin fiber immunoreactivity. Terminations of some individually labeled thalamocortical fibers were restricted to a single patch, whereas others innervated more than one patch by collateral branches. Fibers from the dorsad nuclei ending in areas of less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity surrounding the primary auditory cortex formed much larger terminal patches centered largely in layer IIIB. Fibers from the magnocellular nucleus had relatively few terminal branches but innervated extremely wide areas by collaterals of single axons. Two types of axons arose from the magnocellular nucleus, one terminating preferentially in middle cortical layers and the other exclusively in layer I. These may arise respectively from parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cell populations in the magnocellular nucleus.

Left and right IFCop are implicated in developmental stuttering. Weak left IFCop connections and divergent connectivity of hyperactive right IFCop regions have been related to impeded speech. Here, we reanalyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 83 children (41 stuttering). We generated connection probability maps of functionally segregated area 44 parcels and calculated hemisphere-wise analyses of variance. Children who stutter showed reduced connectivity of executive, rostral-motor, and caudal-motor corticostriatal projections from the left IFCop. We discuss this finding in the context of tracing studies from the macaque area 44, which leads to the need to reconsider current models of speech motor control. Unlike the left, the right IFCop revealed increased connectivity of the inferior posterior ventral parcel and decreased connectivity of the posterior dorsal parcel with the anterior insula, particularly in stuttering boys. This divergent connectivity pattern in young children adds to the debate on potential core deficits in stuttering and challenges the theory that right hemisphere differences might exclusively indicate compensatory changes that evolve from lifelong exposure.

The specificity of SEF pathways was determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry to compare its connections with those of the arcuate frontal eye field (FEF), contiguous dorsocaudal area 6 (6DC), and primary motor cortex (M1, arm/hand region). Results indicate that patterns of SEF connectivity were similar to the FEF and markedly different from areas 6DC and M1. Primary reciprocal thalamic pathways of the SEF were with the magnocellular ventral anterior (VA) nucleus, medial parvicellular VA, medial area X, and paralaminar medialis dorsalis (multiformis and parvicellularis). FEF showed similar connections but its most robust pathway was with MD rather than VA. In contrast, area 6DC showed the most extensive reciprocal connections with lateral VApc and lateral area X with only sparse connections with paralaminar MD. Area 6DC also exhibited reciprocal connections with the ventral lateral (VL) complex and the ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo). M1 showed dense bidirectional connections with VPLo, and to a lesser extent, with VL. M1 pathways with the medial dorsal nucleus were negligible. All areas exhibited connections with the paracentral and central lateral nuclei and only M1 lacked connections with the central superior lateral nucleus. SEF and FEF exhibited similar efferent projections to the caudate and putamen. In the caudate, terminal fields were restricted to a central longitudinal core while those from area 6DC were more widely distributed. Eye field efferents were restricted to the putamen's face region while 6DC projections were more exuberant. The arm/hand region of M1 projected to the arm/hand region of the putamen.

Striatal neurone degeneration is a hallmark in Huntington's disease and we were interested in estimating total neurone and glial number in this thalamic nuclear complex. Serial 500-mu m-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal sections of the left hemisphere from six cases of Huntington's disease patients (three females, three males) and six age- and sex-matched controls were investigated applying Cavalieri's principle and the optical disector. Mean neurone number in the controls was 646,952 +/- 129,668 cells versus 291,763 +/- 60,122 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Total glial cell number (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and unclassifiable glial profiles) was higher in controls with 9,544,191 +/- 3,028,944 versus 6,961,989 +/- 2,241,543 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.021). Considerable increase of fibrous astroglia within the centromedian-parafascicular complex could be observed after Gallyas' impregnation. Most probably this cell type enhanced the numerical ratio between glial number and neurone number (glial index: Huntington's disease patients = 24.4 +/- 8.1; controls = 15.0 +/- 5.2; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.013). The neurone number in the centromedian-parafascicular complex correlated negatively, although statistically not significantly, with the striatal neurone number. This lack of correlation between an 80% neuronal loss in the striatum and a 55% neurone loss in the centromedian-parafascicular complex points to viable neuronal circuits connecting the centromedian-parafascicular complex with cortical and subcortical regions that are less affected in Huntington's disease.";"NERVENKRANKENHAUS BEZIRKS UNTERFRANKEN,D-97816 LOHR,GERMANY; PSYCHIAT LANDESKRANKENHAUS WIESLOCH,D-69155 WIESLOCH,GERMANY; KLINIKUM BAYREUTH,INST PATHOL,D-95445 BAYREUTH,GERMANY; NERVENKRANKENHAUS BEZIRKS OBERFRANKEN,D-95445 BAYREUTH,GERMANY; UNIV MUNICH,INST RECHTS MED,D-80337 MUNICH,GERMANY; INST PATHOL,KLINIKUM ASCHAFFENBURG,D-63739 ASCHAFFENBURG,GERMANY; UNIV WURZBURG,INST PATHOL,D-97080 WURZBURG,GERMANY";"Klinikum Bayreuth; University of Munich; University of Wurzburg";Heinsen, H (corresponding author), UNIV WURZBURG,NERVENKLIN,FUCHSLEINSTR 15,D-97080 WURZBURG,GERMANY.;;;;;;;;68;77;78;0;3;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0001-6322;;;ACTA NEUROPATHOL;Acta Neuropathol.;FEB;1996;91;2;;;;;161;168;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004010050408;;;8;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Pathology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Pathology";TR758;8787149;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1996TR75800006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The animals were trained on two reaching tasks and one tactile texture discrimination task. Task 1 simply involved reaching toward and grasping a reward from one of five well positions. Task 2 required the monkey to use both hands simultaneously to obtain a reward. The tactile texture discrimination task required the monkey to signal the roughness of a passively delivered texture using its jaw. After lesions to area 5, the monkeys showed a decrease in hand use for tasks 1 and 2 and an inability to perform task 2 in specific locations in visual space. These deficits recovered within several days. No deficits were observed in the tactile texture discrimination task or in an analgesic control monkey. Electrophysiological recordings made just before the lesion, immediately after the lesion, and 2 months after the lesion demonstrated that cortical areas just rostral to the lesioned area 5, and areas 1 and 2, were topographically reorganized and that receptive fields for neurons in these fields changed location on the body surface. These cortical map changes are correlative and may, in part, contribute to the rapid behavioral recovery observed. The mechanism for such rapid changes may be the unmasking of existing divergent and convergent thalamocortical connections that are part of the normal cortical circuitry.;"[Padberg, Jeffrey; Recanzone, Gregg; Engle, James; Cooke, Dylan; Goldring, Adam; Krubitzer, Leah] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Padberg, Jeffrey] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Biol, Conway, AR 72035 USA; [Engle, James; Goldring, Adam; Krubitzer, Leah] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Recanzone, Gregg] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Central Arkansas; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Krubitzer, L (corresponding author), Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;lakrubitzer@ucdavis.edu;Cooke, Dylan F./O-9954-2019;"Cooke, Dylan F./0000-0002-5976-705X; Goldring, Adam/0000-0003-0082-9532";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01-NS35103]; National Eye Institute (NEI) [R01-EY013458, F32-EY014503-01A1]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Eye Institute (NEI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))";This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant R01-NS35103 (to L.K.), National Eye Institute (NEI) Grant R01-EY013458 (to G.

However, it is unclear when and how the cerebellar outputs contribute to M1 activity. To address this question, we examined the response of M1 neurons to electrical stimulation of the DN and M1 activity during performance of arm-reaching tasks. Based on response patterns to DN stimulation, M1 neurons were classified into facilitation-, suppression-, and no-response-types. During tasks, not only facilitation- and suppression-type M1 neurons, but also no response-type M1 neurons increased or decreased their firing rates in relation to arm reaching movements. However, the firing rates of facilitation- and suppression-type neurons were higher than those of no-response-type neurons during both inter-trial intervals and arm reaching movements. These results imply that cerebellar outputs contribute to both spontaneous and movement-related activity in the M1, which help to maintain muscle tones and execute coordinated movements, although other inputs also contribute to movement-related activity. Pharmacological inactivation of the DN supports this notion, in that DN inactivation reduced both spontaneous firing rates and movement-related activity in the M1.

After rabies injections into the SEF, many neurons in the restricted region, the ventral aspects of the dentate nucleus (DN), the caudal pole of the DN, and the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of DN and PIN neurons labeled from the motor cortex. In the basal ganglia, a large number of labeled neurons were confined to the dorsomedial portion of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) as more neurons were labeled in the inner portion of the GPi (GPii) than in the outer portion of the GPi (GPio).

This paper focuses on our current knowledge of the dynamics the receptive field (RF) as broken down into the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) in primate LGN. CRFs in the LGN are known to be similar to those in the retinal ganglion cell layer in terms of both spatial and temporal characteristics, leading to the standard interpretation of the LGN as a relay center from retina to primary visual cortex. ECRFs have generally been found to be large and inhibitory, with some differences in magnitude between the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways. The specific contributions of the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex to LGN ECRF properties are presently unknown. Some reports suggest a retinal origin for extra-classical suppression based on latency arguments and other reports have suggested a thalamic origin for extra-classical suppression. This issue is complicated by the use of anesthetized animals, where cortical activity is likely to be altered. Thus further study of LGN ECRFs is warranted to reconcile these discrepancies. Producing descriptions of RF properties of LGN neurons could be enhanced by employing preferred naturalistic stimuli. Although there has been significant work in cats with natural scene stimuli and noise that statistically imitates natural scenes, we highlight a need for similar data from primates. Obtaining these data may be aided by recent advancements in experimental and analytical techniques that permit the efficient study of nonlinear RF characteristics in addition to traditional linear factors. In light of the reviewed topics, we conclude by suggesting experiments to more clearly elucidate the spatial and temporal structure of ECRFs of primate LGN neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

[C-11]-Mecamylamine was prepared and evaluated as a putative radioligand for positron emission tomography to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The radiosynthesis consisted in the [C-11]-methylation of the desmethyl precursor within 40 min with 30-40% radiochemical yield decay corrected. Biodistribution studies in rats showed that radioligand crossed the blood-brain barrier (0.39% ID at 30 min) and only unmetabolized tracer was recovered from brain at 45 min. Ex vivo autoradiography studies in rats did not indicate preferential uptake, and pre-treatment mecamylamine or with chlorisondamine, an nicotinic receptor inhibitor, did not demonstrate a significant specific binding. To investigate possible specie differences and effects of anesthesia, in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out on anaesthetized baboons and conscious macaques. The regional brain distribution of [C-11]-mecamylamine in the two species of primates exhibited similar kinetics as did the rat with steady state reached about 45-50 min after radiotracer administration. Uptake values were two-fold higher in brain of conscious macaque than in anaesthetized baboon (thalamus: 0.258% ID/(kg mL) in conscious macaques and 0.129% ID/(kg mL) in baboons). PET images showed a radioactivity distribution which was quite homogeneous throughout the brain but with somewhat higher uptake in grey matter than in white. Brain distribution was unaltered by saturation or displacement studies. Possible explanation for the failure to establish specific binding in vivo could be long-lived structural modifications of the ionotropic channel by the unlabeled ligand administered before the tracer. In conclusion, [C-11]-mecamylamine did not satisfy the requirements for a PET tracer of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Two specific retinothalamic projections to area MT have been speculated to relay through the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar nucleus (PIm) and the koniocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although a number of studies have demonstrated retinal inputs to regions of the thalamus where relays to area MT have been observed, the relationship between the retinal terminals and area MT relay cells has not been established. Here we examined direct retino-recipient regions of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) pulvinar nucleus and the LGN following binocular injections of anterograde tracer, as well as area MT relay cells in these nuclei by injection of retrograde tracer into area MT. Retinal afferents were shown to synapse with area MT relay cells as demonstrated by colocalization with the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin. We also established the presence of direct synapes of retinal afferents on area MT relay cells within the PIm, as well as the koniocellular K1 and K3 layers of the LGN, thereby corroborating the existence of two disynaptic pathways from the retina to area MT that bypass V1.;"[Warner, Claire E.; Goldshmit, Yona; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Warner, Claire E.] Monash Univ, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia";"Monash University; Monash University";Bourne, JA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Level 1 N,Bldg 75,STRIP 1, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;james.bourne@armi.monash.edu.au;Bourne, James/B-5265-2018;Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108;National Health and Medical Research Council [436620];National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia);"The authors would like to thank Prof. Paul Martin, Dr Tobias Merson and Rowan Tweedale for making many suggestions that improved this manuscript, Robert Bryson-Richardson for assistance with confocal microscopy and the facilities, scientific and technical assistance of Monash Micro Imaging, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.

Although developmental mechanisms that govern the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex have been characterized in rodents(6-9), the mechanisms that underlie the development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity and the lateral expansion of the PFC with a distinct granular layer 4 in primates(10,11) remain unknown. Here we report an anterior (frontal) to posterior (temporal), PFC-enriched gradient of retinoic acid, a signalling molecule that regulates neural development and function(12-15), and we identify genes that are regulated by retinoic acid in the neocortex of humans and macaques at the early and middle stages of fetal development. We observed several potential sources of retinoic acid, including the expression and cortical expansion of retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzymes specifically in primates as compared to mice. Furthermore, retinoic acid signalling is largely confined to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a retinoic-acid-catabolizing enzyme, which is upregulated in the prospective motor cortex. Genetic deletions in mice revealed that retinoic acid signalling through the retinoic acid receptors RXRG and RARB, as well as CYP26B1-dependent catabolism, are involved in proper molecular patterning of prefrontal and motor areas, development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity, intra-PFC dendritic spinogenesis and expression of the layer 4 marker RORB. Together, these findings show that retinoic acid signalling has a critical role in the development of the PFC and, potentially, in its evolutionary expansion.;"[Shibata, Mikihito; Pattabiraman, Kartik; Lorente-Galdos, Belen; Andrijevic, David; Kim, Suel-Kee; Kaur, Navjot; Muchnik, Sydney K.; Xing, Xiaojun; Santpere, Gabriel; Sousa, Andre M.

To answer this question, we first located flexible and stable value-coding areas in the caudate head (CDh) and caudate tail (CDt) of two rhesus macaque monkeys, and then injected different retrograde tracers into these areas of each monkey. We found that CDh and CDt received different inputs from several cortical and subcortical areas including temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, claustrum and thalamus. Superior temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex projected to both CDh and CDt, with more CDt-projecting than CDh-projecting neurons. In superior temporal cortex and dorsal inferior temporal cortex, layers 3 and 5 projected to CDh while layers 3 and 6 projected to CDt. Prefrontal and cingulate cortex projected mostly to CDh bilaterally, less to CDt unilaterally. A cluster of neurons in the basolateral amygdala projected to CDt. Rostral-dorsal claustrum projected to CDh while caudal-ventral claustrum projected to CDt. Within the thalamus, different nuclei projected to either CDh or CDt. The medial centromedian nucleus and lateral parafascicular nucleus projected to CDt while the medial parafascicular nucleus projected to CDh. The inferior pulvinar and lateral dorsal nuclei projected to CDt. The ventral anterior and medial dorsal nuclei projected to CDh. We found little evidence of neurons projecting to both CDh and CDt across the brain. These data suggest that CDh and CDt can control separate functions using anatomically separate circuits. Understanding the roles of these striatal projections will be important for understanding how value memories are created and stored.;"[Griggs, Whitney S.; Ghazizadeh, Ali; Costello, M.

Here, we studied the functional and anatomical connections of this oculomotor region we call parietal eye field (PEF) with frontal eye field (FEF) and other cortical regions in 2 squirrel monkeys. We demonstrated these connections with intrinsic optical imaging and injections of anatomical tracers. Optical imaging of frontal cortex during stimulation of the PEF evoked focal functional activation within FEF. Tracing studies confirmed the functional PEF-FEF connections. Moreover, tracer injections revealed PEF connections with other PPC regions on the dorsolateral and medial brain surface, cortex in the caudal LS, and visual and auditory cortical association areas. Subcortical projections of PEF were primarily with superior colliculus, and pontine nuclei as well as nuclei of the dorsal posterior thalamus and caudate. These findings suggest that PEF in squirrel monkey is homologous to lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of macaque, supporting the notion that these brain circuits are organized similarly to mediate ethologically relevant oculomotor behaviors.;"[Stepniewska, Iwona; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Kahler-Quesada, Sofia; Friedman, Robert M.] OHSU, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Stepniewska, Iwona] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall, 111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center; Vanderbilt University";Stepniewska, I (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall, 111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;"iwona.stepniewska@vanderbilt.edu; skahlerq@gmail.com; friedmro@ohsu.edu";;;;;;;135;1;1;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Recent findings in the monkey and in humans have led to a parallel and interconnected network. Nevertheless, little is known about these networks. Here, we present two cases of patients with a parietal low-grade glioma. They underwent surgery under local anesthesia with cortical and subcortical mapping. For patient 1, subcortical electrostimulation immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced movement disorders, with an inhibition of leg and arm movements medially and, more laterally, an acceleration of arm movement. For patient 2, electrostimulation of white matter immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced an inhibition of both arm movement. It means that the detected fibers in the parietal lobe may be involved in the motor control modulation. They are distributed veil-like immediately posterior to thalamocortical pathways and could correspond to a fronto-parietal movement control subnetwork.

Here, we determined whether the upstream cortical areas, secondary somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas, also undergo reorganization after lesions of the dorsal columns. Areas S2, PV, and 3b were mapped after long-term unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns at cervical levels in adult macaque monkeys. In areas S2 and PV, we found neurons responding to touch on the face in regions in which responses to touch on the hand and other body parts are normally seen. In the reorganized parts of S2 and PV, inputs from the chin as well as other parts of the face were observed, whereas in area 3b only the chin inputs expand into the deafferented regions. The results show that deafferentations lead to a more widespread brain reorganization than previously known. The data also show that reorganization in areas S2 and PV shares a common substrate with area 3b, but there are specific features that emerge in S2 and PV.;"[Tandon, Shashank; Kambi, Niranjan; Lazar, Leslee; Mohammed, Hisham; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122050, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122050, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023";"Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; tandon, shashank/0000-0002-8109-0129; Lazar, Leslee/0000-0002-2564-7324";"Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship; Trust [063259/Z/00/Z]; National Brain Research Centre";"Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship(Wellcome Trust); Trust; National Brain Research Centre";"This work was supported by Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship (N.

Dysregulation of the CRF system may underlie the pathophysiology of several disorders, including depression and anxiety. The distribution of CRF1 mRNA and CRF1 specific ligand binding has been reported by multiple groups in rodents using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, respectively. More recently, somewhat conflicting rodent anti-CRF1 immunohistochemical studies were reported. In this study we report the generation of an antihuman CRF1 antiserum and provide the first immunohistochemical description of CRF1 distribution in a primate brain, that of the rhesus monkey. The specificity of anti-CRF-R1 antiserum R221 was demonstrated using transfected hCRF(1)-expressing HEK 293 cells and rhesus monkey pituitary. CRF1-immunoreactive neurons were widespread in the rhesus brain. CRF1 staining was associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites and was primarily intracellular, suggesting a high rate of receptor turnover or receptor sequestration. Anti-CRF1 immunoreactivity was most abundant in pituitary, cerebellum, and in portions of brain stem associated with sensorimotor function. CRF1 staining was also observed in cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, portions of the basal ganglia, and thalamus. Staining was relatively low in prefrontal cortex and in limbic areas, which may reflect masking of the N-terminal epitope. The distribution of CRF1 immunoreactivity is suggestive of roles in attentional processing as well as the processing of motor and sensory information.

Peak dose dyskinesia is a major problem in the treatment of parkinsonian patients with levodopa therapy but this remains the best pharmacological agent for treating the condition. The hypothesis was derived from previous work which has suggested that reduced pallidal inhibition of the thalamus results in dyskinesia [Crossman (1990) Movement Dis. 5, 100-108]. A neuroanatomical tracing study was carried out prior to the thalamotomy work, using the anterograde tracer wheatgerm-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. This delineated the anterior part of the ventrolateral thalamus in the primate in terms of its afferent inputs. Wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the medial segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three Macaca fascicularis and traced to terminals in the ventral thalamus and other brain areas. The appropriate thalamic area involved was plotted on atlas sections in preparation for stereotactic thalamotomy. Previous studies of neuronal input to the ventral thalamus are confusing due to the different nomenclatures used by different workers. Early workers used cytoarchitectonic boundaries which do not correspond with function. There are also differences in nomenclature between man, monkey and other animals. The current study maps the pallidal terminal territory within the thalamus in terms of stereotactic co-ordinates related to a published macaque atlas [Shantha et al. (1968) A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Java Monkey Brain. S. Karger, Basel] and can thus be used by other workers in the field. A well-established primate model of Parkinsonism was used for the thalamotomy study. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak-dose dyskinesia which was scored in terms of its choreic and dystonic components. A radiofrequency electrode was used to create the ablative lesions. Chorea was always reduced and frequently abolished by a thalamotomy located in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies in a total of six animals. Four animals received bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations and two animals underwent unilateral surgery. Lesions which were positioned medial to the pallidal terminal territory (n = 3) had no permanent effect upon chorea. Lesions were also made in the thalamic areas which receive cerebellar and nigral inputs and in other areas which receive input from the medial segment of the globus pallidus, including the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the pedunculopontine nucleus. None of these lesions had a significant effect upon peak-dose chorea. In contrast to the dramatic effects upon chorea, peak-dose dystonia was not affected by any of the thalamic lesions. The data suggest that: (i) levodopa-induced chorea can be alleviated by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory of the thalamus and (ii) chorea and dystonia are mediated by different pathophysiological circuits.;;;PAGE, RD (corresponding author), UNIV MANCHESTER,DEPT CELL & STRUCT BIOL,MANCHESTER M13 9PT,LANCS,ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;45;64;65;0;1;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;JUL;1993;55;1;;;;;147;165;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90462-O;;;19;Neurosciences;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";Neurosciences & Neurology;LL163;7688878;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1993LL16300013;View Full Record in Web of Science

TorsinA immunoreactivity was visualized using a monoclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein encoding exon 4 of human torsinA. Western blot analysis of brain homogenates revealed a major species of about 39 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of glycosylated torsinA protein. By light microscopy, torsinA like-immunoreactivity was enriched in gray matter in all brain regions examined. Immunoreactivity was concentrated in the neuropil and immunopositive cell bodies were not observed. Structures particularly enriched in torsinA like-immunoreactivity included the cerebral cortex, the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, the hippocampal formation, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and molecular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Cell bodies of pigmented dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. pars compacta were immunonegative. Biochemical fractionation of the human striata revealed a concentration of torsinA immunoreactivity in particulate fractions. Ultrastructural studies of the human and Macaque striata further revealed an association of torsinA immunostaining with small vesicles within axons and presynaptic terminals forming symmetric synapses. These ultrastructural studies are consistent with a pre-synaptic localization of torsinA protein in the adult striatum and are consistent with a role of torsinA in modulating striatal signaling, although the widespread localization of the protein suggests it probably also participates in signaling in other regions.

These effects seemed to be derived from the supplementary motor area (SMA). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) was used to check this hypothesis. Brain activations were contrasted in Time production and (control) Force production tasks involving left-hand responding. These tasks, presented in mixed order, were designed to be of equivalent difficulty and involve comparable levels of attention. Several brain areas were activated in both tasks relative to baseline: the SMA, the putamen, and the lateral cerebellum. Contrasts between tasks gave clear-cut differences. Activations specific to the Time task were found in the SMA proper and the left primary motor cortex. The Force task activated the right sensorimotor cortex and the left cerebellum, and, bilaterally, the infero-parietal cortex and the insula. The main result, i.e. prominent activation of the SMA proper in relation to temporal production, corroborates our previous studies based on slow cortical potentials. The data are referred to current evidence suggesting that timing processes are subtended by a striato-thalamo-cortical pathway including the SMA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report that these events correspond to momentary drops in cortical arousal and are associated with activity changes in the basal forebrain and thalamus. Combining fMRI and electrophysiology in macaques, we first establish that fMRI transients co-occur with spectral shifts in local field potentials (LFPs) toward low frequencies. Applying this knowledge to fMRI data from the human connectome project, we find that the fMRI transients are strongest in sensory cortices. Surprisingly, the positive cortical transients occur together with negative transients in focal subcortical areas known to be involved with arousal regulation, most notably the basal forebrain. This subcortical involvement, combined with the prototypical pattern of LFP spectral shifts, suggests that commonly observed widespread variations in fMRI cortical activity are associated with momentary drops in arousal.;"[Liu, Xiao; de Zwart, Jacco A.; Chang, Catie; Duyn, Jeff H.] NINDS, Adv MRI Sect, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Liu, Xiao] Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Multimodal & Computat Neuroimaging Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Xiao] Penn State Univ, Inst CyberSci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Schoelvinck, Marieke L.] Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NINDS, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Max Planck Society; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";"Liu, X (corresponding author), NINDS, Adv MRI Sect, Lab Funct & Mol Imaging, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Liu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Multimodal & Computat Neuroimaging Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Liu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Inst CyberSci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.";xxl213@engr.psu.edu;"Duyn, Jozef H/F-2483-2010; Liu, Xiao/C-5943-2016";"Liu, Xiao/0000-0002-8459-3135; de Zwart, Jacco/0000-0001-8155-8185; Scholvinck, Marieke/0000-0001-5750-825X";"NIH Intramural Research [ZIA MH002896, ZIC MH002899]; NIH [(K99/R00) 4R00NS092996-02]";"NIH Intramural Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This research was supported (in part) by the NIH Intramural Research (ZIA MH002896, ZIC MH002899), and the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) 4R00NS092996-02.

While selective basal ganglia lesions (caudate and/or putamen exclusively) did not affect voluntary movements of the extremities, lesions of the anterior (plus caudate/putamen) or posterior limb of the internal capsule led to an initially severe motor impairment followed by excellent recovery, hand function included. In contrast, lesions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule in combination with damage to lateral thalamus compromised motor outcome. In experimental tracing of the topography of the internal capsule in macaque monkeys, we found axons of primary motor cortex passing through the middle third of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Axons of premotor cortex (dorsolateral and post-arcuate area 6) passed through the capsular genu, and those of supplementary motor area (mesial area 6) through the anterior limb. Small capsular lesion can therefore disrupt the output of functionally and anatomically distinct motor areas selectively. The clinically similar motor deficits with a similar course of functional restitution following disruption of these different descending motor pathways indicate a parallel operation of cortical motor areas.

Importantly, these studies demonstrate that the corticothalamic projection cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be considered as an integral part of a thalamo-corticothalamic circuit which intimately interconnects the thalamus and cortex for sensory processing.;"[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

Pulvinar neurons have been shown to integrate the component signals of a plaid pattern into a coherent global percept (pattern-motion selectivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have investigated the possibility that the human pulvinar is also involved in plaid-defined higher-order motion integration. Plaid patterns were presented to normal observers in two conditions (coherent vs. transparent) created by varying the relative spatial frequency of the two gratings comprising the plaid. Regions of interest analysis revealed a significant activation of the pulvinar in the coherent condition supporting the notion that the human pulvinar nucleus is involved in higher-order motion processing. Plaid pattern activation was also observed in the media temporal gyrus (area MT/V5), a motion area with strong anatomical connections to the pulvinar. These data provide the first direct evidence that the human pulvinar is involved in complex motion integration, as previously shown in animal models, and further support the existence of cortico-thalamo-cortical computational networks involved in higher-order visual processing.

The mechanism is poorly understood. High-frequency STN DBS has been reported to affect motor cortex excitability in a complex way, but the timing between STN stimuli and changes in motor cortical (M1) excitability has not been investigated. We examined the time course of changes in motor cortical excitability following single pulse STN DBS. We studied 14 PD patients with implanted DBS electrodes in the STN, 2 patients with electrodes in internal globus pallidus (GPi), and 1 patient with an electrode in the sensory thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the M1 ipsilateral to the DBS with induced currents either in the anterior-posterior direction in the brain to evoke indirect ( I) waves or in the lateral-medial direction to activate corticospinal axons directly. Single pulse stimulation through the DBS contacts preceded the TMS by 0 - 10 ms. Surface EMG was recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. Three milliseconds after STN stimulation, the motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitudes produced by anterior-posterior current were significantly larger than control responses, while the responses to lateral-medial currents were unchanged. Similar facilitation also occurred after GPi stimulation, but not with thalamic stimulation. Single pulse STN stimulation facilitates the M1 at short latencies. The possible mechanisms include antidromic excitation of the cortico-STN fibers or transmission through the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway.;"Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Western Res Inst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Div Neurol, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Div Neurosurg, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada";"University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto";Hanajima, R (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.;hanajima-tky@umin.ac.jp;"Lozano, Andres M/A-5058-2012; Lang, Anthony/ABF-8114-2021; Chen, Robert/B-3899-2009";"Chen, Robert/0000-0002-8371-8629; Lang, Anthony/0000-0003-1229-3667; Lozano, Andres M./0000-0001-8257-3694";;;;;42;44;46;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Although numerous changes have been reported in local functional studies, few studies have reported on the anatomical network of the entire brain. Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey. Then, the drifts in centrality from normal to PD networks were described in terms of complex network analysis and summarized with principal component analysis. Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns. The present study also demonstrated that the current targets of DBS shared a common feature: their centrality values being relatively low in the normal brain while intensely drifting with PD.

However, the structural organization of the IPCC is a controversial issue. For example, cytoarchitectonic parcellations reported in the literature range from 2 to 7 areas. Moreover, anatomical descriptions of the human IPCC are often based on experiments in the macaque monkey. In this study, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging combined with probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity of the human IPCC, and used this information to parcellate this cortex area. This provides a new structural map of the human IPCC, comprising 3 subareas (inferior parietal cortex anterior, IPC middle, and IPC posterior) of comparable size, in a rostro-caudal arrangement in the left and right hemispheres. Each subarea is characterized by a connectivity fingerprint, and the parcellation is similar to the subdivision reported for the macaque IPCC with 3 areas in a rostro-caudal arrangement (PF, PFG, and PG). However, the present study also reliably demonstrates new structural features in the connectivity pattern of the human IPCC, which are not known to exist in the macaque. This study quantifies intersubject variability by providing a population representation of the subarea arrangement and demonstrates the substantial lateralization of the connectivity patterns of the IPCC.;"[Ruschel, Michael; Knoesche, Thomas R.; Anwander, Alfred] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Res Grp Cort Networks & Cognit Funct, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Friederici, Angela D.; Anwander, Alfred] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neuropsychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Turner, Robert; Geyer, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurophys, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany";"Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society";Anwander, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.;anwander@cbs.mpg.de;Anwander, Alfred/B-5874-2011;"Anwander, Alfred/0000-0002-4861-4808; Turner, Robert/0000-0001-5055-9644";"University Leipzig MD grant; Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open [238292]";"University Leipzig MD grant; Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open";This work was supported by a University Leipzig MD grant to M.R. and the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project CONNECT of the European Union, under FET-Open (grant no. 238292): http://www.brain-connect.eu.;;59;59;59;0;15;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

The high affinity, K-D = 30 pM, makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing both striatal and extrastriatal binding in the brain. In this work, dynamic PET studies of two macaque monkeys were acquired along with arterial plasma samples. Compartmental analysis and Logan plots were used to analyze the striatum, thalamus, frontal, and temporal cortices and to validate a reference region of analysis which yields a distribution volume ratio (DVR). The cerebellum was used as the reference region. The results indicate that all methods of analysis are in close agreement over all the analyzed regions in the brain. The average DVRs for the two monkeys was found to be: caudate = 26, putamen = 29, thalamus = 3.8, frontal ctx = 1.7, and temporal ctx = 1.7 on a high-resolution PET scanner. It was found that a scan time of 2 h is needed to accurately estimate the DVR for all regions of the brain. The striatal regions require the longest to linearize and are the most sensitive to variations in time average tissue-to-plasma efflux constant, (k) over bar(2). For the extrastriatal regions, the effect of the (k) over bar(2) term on DVR calculation is negligible. Repeatability measurements for all regions were found to be within 10% using the DVR parameter.

We hypothesize that these waves are the predominant physiological process reflected in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal fluctuations. The correlation structure (functional connectivity) of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques.

Here, we show that a pulvino-cortical circuit model, composed of the pulvinar and two cortical areas, captures several physiological and behavioral observations related to the macaque pulvinar. Effective connections between the two cortical areas are gated by the pulvinar, allowing the pulvinar to shift the operation regime of these areas during attentional processing and working memory and resolve conflict in decision making. Furthermore, cortico-pulvinar projections that engage the thalamic reticular nucleus enable the pulvinar to estimate decision confidence. Finally, feedforward and feedback pulvino-cortical pathways participate in frequency-dependent inter-areal interactions that modify the relative hierarchical positions of cortical areas.

Patients are afflicted primarily with progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Studies in mice, cats, and sheep have indicated safety and widespread distribution of Hex in the CNS after intracranial vector infusion of AAVrh8 vectors encoding species-specific Hex alpha- or beta-subunits at a 1: 1 ratio. Here, a safety study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques (cm), modeling previous animal studies, with bilateral infusion in the thalamus as well as in left lateral ventricle of AAVrh8 vectors encoding cm Hex alpha- and beta-subunits. Three doses (3.2 x 10(12) vg [n= 3]; 3.2 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]; or 1.1 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]) were tested, with controls infused with vehicle (n= 1) or transgene empty AAVrh8 vector at the highest dose (n= 2). Most monkeys receiving AAVrh8-cmHexa/b developed dyskinesias, ataxia, and loss of dexterity, with higher dose animals eventually becoming apathetic. Time to onset of symptoms was dose dependent, with the highest-dose cohort producing symptoms within a month of infusion. One monkey in the lowest-dose cohort was behaviorally asymptomatic but had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the thalami. Histopathology was similar in all monkeys injected with AAVrh8cm-Hex alpha/beta, showing severe white and gray matter necrosis along the injection track, reactive vasculature, and the presence of neurons with granular eosinophilic material. Lesions were minimal to absent in both control cohorts. Despite cellular loss, a dramatic increase in Hex activity was measured in the thalamus, and none of the animals presented with antibody titers against Hex. The high overexpression of Hex protein is likely to blame for this negative outcome, and this study demonstrates the variations in safety profiles of AAVrh8-Hex alpha/beta intracranial injection among different species, despite encoding for self-proteins.";"[Golebiowski, Diane; Maitland, Stacy; GuhaSarkar, Dwijit; Sena-Esteves, Miguel] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Worcester, MA USA; [Golebiowski, Diane; Maitland, Stacy; GuhaSarkar, Dwijit; Sena-Esteves, Miguel] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Horae Gene Therapy Ctr, Worcester, MA USA; [van der Bom, Imramsjah M.

Tic generation has been linked to disturbed networks of brain areas involved in planning, controlling and execution of actions, particularly structural and functional disorders in the striatum and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. We therefore applied structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize changes in intrahemispheric white matter connectivity in cortico-subcortical circuits engaged in motor control in 15 GTS patients without psychiatric comorbidities. White matter connectivity was analyzed by probabilistic fiber tractography between 12 pre-defined cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Connectivity values were combined with measures of clinical severity rated by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). GTS patients showed widespread structural connectivity deficits. Lower connectivity values were found specifically in tracts connecting the supplementary motor areas (SMA) with basal ganglia (pre-SMA-putamen, SMA-putamen) and in frontal cortico-cortical circuits. There was an overall trend towards negative correlations between structural connectivity in these tracts and YGTSS scores. Structural connectivity of frontal brain networks involved in planning, controlling and executing actions is reduced in adult GTS patients which is associated with tic severity. These findings are in line with the concept of GTS as a neurodevelopmental disorder of brain immaturity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the spatial organization of the connections that link digit representations of areas 3b with other somatosensory areas is less understood. Here we examined the cortical inputs to individual digit representations of area 3b in four squirrel monkeys and one prosimian galago. Retrograde tracers were injected into neurophysiologically defined representations of individual digits of area 3b. Cortical tissues were cut parallel to the surface in some cases and showed that feedback projections to individual digits overlapped extensively in the hand representations of areas 3b, 1, and parietal ventral (PV) and second somatosensory (S2) areas. Other regions with overlapping populations of labeled cells included area 3a and primary motor cortex (M1). The results were confirmed in other cases in which the cortical tissues were cut in the coronal plane. The same cases also showed that cells were primarily labeled in the infragranular and supragranular layers. Thus, feedback projections to individual digit representations in area 3b mainly originate from multiple digits and other portions of hand representations of areas 3b, 1, PV, and S2. This organization is in stark contrast to the segregated thalamocortical inputs, which originate in single digit representations and terminate in the matching digit representation in the cortex. The organization of feedback connections could provide a substrate for the integration of information across the representations of adjacent digits in area 3b. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3768-3790, 2013.

Currently, there are no effective therapies for this disease. Previously, we have shown that RNA interference mediated silencing of ATXN1 mRNA provides therapeutic benefit in mouse models of the disease. Adeno-associated viral delivery of an engineered microRNA targeting ATXN1 to the cerebella of well-established mouse models improved motor phenotypes, neuropathy, and transcriptional changes. Here, we test the translatability of this approach in adult rhesus cerebella. Nine adult male and three adult female rhesus macaque were unilaterally injected with our therapeutic vector, a recombinant adeno-associated virus type 1 (rAAV1) expressing our RNAi trigger (miS1) and co-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rAAV1.miS1eGFP) into the deep cerebellar nuclei using magnetic resonance imaging guided techniques combined with a Stealth Navigation system (Medtronics Inc.). Transduction was evident in the deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar Purkinje cells, the brainstem and the ventral lateral thalamus. Reduction of endogenous ATXN1 messenger RNA levels were a parts per thousand yen30% in the deep cerebellar nuclei, the cerebellar cortex, inferior olive, and thalamus relative to the uninjected hemisphere. There were no clinical complications, and quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that this therapeutic intervention strategy and subsequent reduction of ATXN1 is well tolerated. Collectively the data illustrate the biodistribution and tolerability of rAAV1.miS1eGFP administration to the adult rhesus cerebellum and are supportive of clinical application for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.;"[Keiser, Megan S.; Davidson, Beverly L.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Raymond G Perelman Ctr Cellular & Mol Therapeut, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kordower, Jeffrey H.] Rush Univ, Dept Neurol Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Gonzalez-Alegre, Pedro] Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Davidson, Beverly L.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; Rush University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania";Davidson, BL (corresponding author), Ctr Cellular & Mol Therapeut, Colket Translat Res Bldg,3501 Civic Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;davidsonbl@email.chop.edu;;Davidson, Beverly/0000-0002-3715-6290;"National Institutes of Health [NS045667]; University of Iowa Roy J.

However, when simulations are conducted on models with sufficient biophysical details, great challenges arise from limited computer power, thereby restricting most existing computational works with biophysical models only to small-scale networks. On the other hand, with the emergence of powerful computing platforms, many recent works are geared to performing large-scale simulations with simple spiking models. However, the applicability of those works is limited by the nature of the underlying phenomenological model. To bridge the gap, an intermediate step is taken to construct a scalable brain model with sufficient biophysical details. In this work, great efforts are devoted to taking into account not only local cortical microcircuits but also the global brain architecture, and efficient techniques are proposed and adopted to address the associated computational challenges in simulation of networks of such complexity. With the customized simulator developed, we are able to simulate the brain model to generate not only sleep spindle and delta waves but also the spike-and-wave pattern of absence seizures, and directly link those behaviors to underlying biophysical mechanism. Those initial results are interesting because they show the possibility to determine underlying causes of diseases by simulating the biologically realistic brain model. With further development, the work is geared to assisting the clinicians in selecting the optimal treatment on an individual basis in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using FDG PET data and Structural Equation Modeling, a formal depression model was created to explicitly test current theories of limbic-cortical dysfunction in MDD and to characterize at the path level potential sources of baseline variability reported in this patient population. A 7-region model consisting of lateral prefrontal cortex (latF9), anterior thalamus (aTh), anterior cingulate (Cg24), subgenual cingulate (Cg25), orbital frontal cortex (OF711), hippocampus (Hc), and medial frontal cortex (mF10) was tested in scans of 119 depressed patients and 42 healthy control subjects acquired during three separate studies at two different institutions. A single model, based on previous theory and supported by anatomical connectivity literature, was stable for the three groups of depressed patients. Within the context of this model, path differences among groups as a function of treatment response characteristics were also identified. First, limbic-cortical connections (latF9-Cg25-OF11-Hc) differentiated drug treatment responders from nonresponders. Second, nonresponders showed additional abnormalities in limbic-subcortical pathways (aTh-Cg24-Cg25-OF11-Hc). Lastly, more limited limbic-cortical (Hc-latF9) and cortical-cortical (OF11-mF10) path differences differentiated responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) from responders to pharmacotherapy.

In contrast, the projections from the pulvinar nucleus to the cortex are less clearly defined. The pulvinar projects predominantly to layer I in V1, and layer IV in extrastriate areas. These projection patterns suggest that the pulvinar nucleus most strongly influences (drives) activity in cortical areas beyond V1. Should this hypothesis be true, one would expect the spatiotemporal responses evoked by pulvinar activation to be different in V1 and extrastriate areas, reflecting the different connectivity patterns. We investigated this issue by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical visual areas' activity following thalamic electrical microstimulation in tree shrews, using optical imaging and voltage-sensitive dyes. As expected, electrical stimulation of the dLGN induced fast and local responses in V1, as well as in extrastriate and contralateral cortical areas. In contrast, electrical stimulation of the pulvinar induced fast and local responses in extrastriate areas, followed by weak and diffuse activation in V1 and contralateral cortical areas.

A proposal is made that both the dorsal and ventral streams must be concurrently active to generate conscious awareness and that V1 (striate cortex) provides a serial link between them. An argument is presented against a true extrastriate communication between the dorsal and ventral streams. Secondly, a detailed theory is developed for the structure of the visual hierarchy. Premotor theory states that each organism-object interaction can be described by the two quantitative measures of torque and change in joint position served by the basal ganglia and cerebellum, respectively. This leads to a component theory of motor efference copy providing a fundamental toot for categorizing dorsal and ventral stream networks. The rationale for this is that the dorsal stream specifies spatial coordinates of the external world, which can be coded by the reafference of changes in joint position. The ventral stream is concerned with object recognition and is coded for by forces exerted on the world during a developmental exploratory phase of the organism. The proposed pathways for a component motor efference copy from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia converge on the thalamus and modulate thalamocortical projections via the thalamic reticular nucleus. The origin of the corticopontine projections, which are a massive pathway for cortical information to reach the cerebellum, coincides with the area typically considered as part of the dorsal stream, whereas the entire cortex projects to the striatum. This adds empirical support for a new conceptualization of the visual streams. The model also presents a solution to the binding problem of a neural correlate of consciousness, that is, how a distributed neural network synchronizes its activity during a cognitive event. It represents a reinterpretation of the current status of the visual hierarchy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Face working memory demonstrated significant increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative to location working memory, in fusiform, parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, and in right thalamus and midline cerebellum. Location working memory demonstrated significant increases in rCBF relative to face working memory, in superior and inferior parietal cortex, and in the superior frontal sulcus.

Yet high-frequency EEG potentials (hf-EEG, f > 400 Hz) found in somatosensory evoked potentials of primates may reflect the mean population spike responses of coactivated cortical neurons. Since cortical responses to electrical nerve stimulation vary strongly from trial to trial, we investigated whether the hf-EEG signal can also echo single-trial variability observed at the single-unit level. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of behaving macaque monkeys and identified variable spike burst responses following peripheral stimulation. Each of these responses was classified according to the timing of its spike constituents, conforming to one of a discrete set of spike patterns. We here show that these spike patterns are accompanied by variations in the concomitant epidural hf-EEG. These variations cannot be explained by fluctuating stimulus efficacy, suggesting that they were generated within the thalamocortical network. As high-frequency EEG signals can also be reliably recorded from the scalp of human subjects, they may provide a noninvasive window on fluctuating cortical spike activity in humans.";"[Telenczuk, Bartosz] Humboldt Univ, Inst Theoret Biol, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Telenczuk, Bartosz; Curio, Gabriel] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Baker, Stuart N.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Herz, Andreas V.

What is the Bereitschaftspotential? Clin Neurophysiol 2006; 117:2341-56) were studied in patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MID) to elucidate the pathophysiology of voluntary movement. Methods: We studied nine genetically proven MJD patients and eight age-matched healthy subjects. Multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained during self-paced fast extensions of the wrist. EEG epochs were time-locked to electromyography (EMG) onset or offset of the voluntary EMG burst and averaged. Results: In the MJD patients, the early Bereitschaftspotential (early BP, -1500 to -500 ms) was not affected but the late BP was reduced over the central midline area and contralaterally to the movement side. The amplitude of the fpMP, a post-movement MRCP component, was also reduced. In addition, the offset cortical potential in the first 500 ms after EMG offset (Moff + 500) was attenuated bilaterally over a wide cortical area. Conclusions: Findings suggest that cortical activations associated with the initiation and termination of a voluntary movement are impaired in MJD patients.

Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as templates for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.;"[Falahpour, Maryam; Wong, Chi Wah; Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Funct MRI, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0677, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Radiol, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Liu, Thomas T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chang, Catie] NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA";"Falahpour, M; Liu, TT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Funct MRI, 9500 Gilman Dr MC 0677, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.";"mfalahpour@ucsd.edu; catie.chang@nih.gov; cwwong@ieee.org; ttliu@ucsd.edu";Wong, Chi Wah/AAQ-6381-2021;"Wong, Chi Wah/0000-0002-2833-979X; Liu, Thomas/0000-0002-1978-7486";NIH [R21MH112155];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported in part by NIH grant R21MH112155.;;51;40;40;0;12;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;Jul 01;2018;174;;;;;;317;327;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.03.012;;;11;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";GM9XK;29548849;Green Submitted, Green Accepted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000438609100028;View Full Record in Web of Science

Existence of this second pathway in primates, however, is not well established. A major question centers on whether the pulvinar acts as a relay, particularly in the path from the superior colliculus (SC) to the motion area in middle temporal cortex (MT). We used physiological microstimulation to identify pulvinar neurons belonging to the path from SC to MT in the macaque. We made three salient observations. First, we identified many neurons in the visual pulvinar that received input from SC or projected to MT, as well as a largely separate set of neurons that received input from MT. Second, and more importantly, we identified a subset of neurons as relay neurons that both received SC input and projected to MT. The identification of these relay neurons demonstrates a continuous functional path from SC to MT through the pulvinar in primates. Third, we histologically localized a subset of SC-MT relay neurons to the subdivision of inferior pulvinar known to project densely to MT but also localized SC-MT relay neurons to an adjacent subdivision. This pattern indicates that the pulvinar pathway is not limited to a single anatomically defined region. These findings bring new perspective to the functional organization of the pulvinar and its role in conveying signals to the cerebral cortex.;"[Berman, Rebecca A.; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda 20982, MD USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Berman, RA (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 2A50,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda 20982, MD USA.;bermanr@nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute Intramural Research;National Eye Institute Intramural Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health.

In the scans in which [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 was co-administered with vehicle, the brain areas with the highest standardised uptake values (SUVs) were the midbrain, cerebellum and thalamus, while the lowest SUVs were found in the pons. The addition of AZD8529 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) to [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 did not modify the SUVs obtained with [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 alone, and ex vivo blocking autoradiography with PAM AZD8529 (10, 100, 300 mu M) on marmoset brain sections showed increased signals in the blocking conditions compared to vehicle, suggesting that no competition occurred between the 2 ligands. The results we obtained here do not suggest that [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 interacts selectively, or even at all, with mGlu(2) receptors in the marmoset, in agreement with findings previously reported in macaque and human.;"[Kang, Min Su; Aliaga, Arturo; Rosa-Neto, Pedro] McGill Univ, Translat Neuroimaging Lab, Res Ctr Studies Aging, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kang, Min Su; Aliaga, Arturo; Mathieu, Axel; Rosa-Neto, Pedro] McGill Univ, Douglas Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kang, Min Su] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Artificial Intelligence & Computat Neurosci Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kang, Min Su] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Hurvitz Brain Sci Program, LC Campbell Cognit Neurol Unit, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hamadjida, Adjia; Bedard, Dominique; Ross, Karen; Bdair, Hussein; Tardif, Christine Lucas; Soucy, Jean-Paul; Massarweh, Gassan; Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Huot, Philippe] Montreal Neurol Inst Hosp Neuro, Neurodegenerat Dis Grp, 3801 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Nuara, Stephen G.; Gourdon, Jim C.] McGill Univ, Comparat Med & Anim Resource Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Frey, Stephen] Rogue Res Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Aliaga, Arturo; Ross, Karen; Hopewell, Robert; Tardif, Christine Lucas; Soucy, Jean-Paul; Massarweh, Gassan; Rosa-Neto, Pedro] Montreal Neurol Inst Hosp Neuro, McConnell Brain Imaging Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Huot, Philippe] McGill Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Huot, Philippe] McGill Univ, Dept Neurosci, Div Neurol, Movement Disorder Clin,Hlth Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada";"McGill University; McGill University; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; University of Toronto; Sunnybrook Health Science Center; Sunnybrook Research Institute; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University";"Huot, P (corresponding author), Montreal Neurol Inst Hosp Neuro, Neurodegenerat Dis Grp, 3801 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.;Huot, P (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Huot, P (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Neurosci, Div Neurol, Movement Disorder Clin,Hlth Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada.";philippe.huot@mcgill.ca;;;"Parkinson Canada, Parkinson Quebec, Fonds de Recherche Quebec - Sante; Weston Brain Institute; Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives";"Parkinson Canada, Parkinson Quebec, Fonds de Recherche Quebec - Sante; Weston Brain Institute; Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))";PH has had research support from Parkinson Canada, Parkinson Quebec, Fonds de Recherche Quebec - Sante, the Weston Brain Institute, the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives.;;35;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0028-1298;1432-1912;;N-S ARCH PHARMACOL;Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

We investigated how multiple projection systems to the thalamus are organized in prefrontal cortex after injection of distinct retrograde tracers in the principal mediodorsal (MD), the limbic anterior medial (AM), and the motor-related ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Neurons projecting to these nuclei were organized in interdigitated modules extending vertically within layers VI and V. Projection neurons were also organized in layers. The majority of projection neurons to MID or AM originated in layer VI (similar to 80%), but a significant proportion (similar to 20%) originated in layer V. In contrast, prefrontal neurons projecting to VA/VL were equally distributed in layers V and VI. Neurons directed to VA/VL occupied mostly the upper part of layer V, while neurons directed to MD or AM occupied mostly the deep part of layer V. The highest proportions of projection neurons in layer V to each nucleus were found in dorsal and medial prefrontal areas. The laminar organization of prefrontal cortico-thalamic projections differs from sensory systems, where projections originate predominantly or entirely from layer VI. Previous studies indicate that layer V corticothalamic neurons innervate through some large terminals thalamic neurons that project widely to superficial cortical layers. The large population of prefrontal projection neurons in layer V may drive thalamic neurons, triggering synchronization by recruiting several cortical areas through widespread thalamocortical projections to layer I. These pathways may underlie the synthesis of cognition, emotion and action. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to determine the proportion of labeled neurons contributing to this projection system by the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei, and to investigate the relationship of thalamic projections to specific architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex. We selected areas for study within both the basoventral (areas 11, 12, and ventral 46) and the mediodorsal (areas 32, 14, 46, and 8) prefrontal sectors. This choice was based on our previous studies, which indicate differences in cortical projections to these two distinct architectonic sectors (Barbas, '88; Barbas and Pandya, '89). In addition, for each sector we included areas with different architectonic profiles, which is also relevant to the connectional patterns of the prefrontal cortices. The results showed that MD included a clear majority (over 80%) of all thalamic neurons directed to some prefrontal cortices (areas 11, 46, and 8); it contributed just over half to some others (areas 12 and 32), and less than a third to area 14. Clusters of neurons directed to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal areas were largely segregated within MD: the former were found ventrally, the latter dorsally. However, the most striking findings establish a relationship between thalamic origin and laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. Most thalamic neurons directed to lateral prefrontal cortices, which are characterized by a high degree of laminar definition (areas 46 and 8), originated in the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions of MD, and only a few were found in other nuclei. In contrast, orbital and medial cortices, which have a low degree of laminar differentiation, were targeted by the magnocellular subdivision of MD and by numerous other limbic thalamic nuclei, including the midline and the anterior. Thus topographic specificity in the origin of thalamic projections increased as the laminar definition of the target area increased. Moreover, the rostrocaudal distribution of labeled neurons in MD and the medial pulvinar also differed depending on the degree of the laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. The rostral parts of MD and the medial pulvinar projected to the eulaminate lateral prefrontal cortices, whereas their caudal parts projected to orbital and medial limbic cortices. Selective destruction of caudal MD is known to disrupt mnemonic processes in both humans and monkeys, suggesting that this thalamic-limbic prefrontal loop may constitute an important pathway for memory.";BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA;Boston University;BARBAS, H (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV, DEPT HLTH SCI, 635 COMMONWEALTH AVE 431, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.;;;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;NINDS NIH HHS [NS24760] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;72;224;227;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Local rates of cerebral metabolism were determined after an intravenous infusion of 1.0 mg/kg cocaine or vehicle in six awake cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) trained to sit calmly in a primate chair. Cocaine administration decreased glucose utilization in a discrete set of structures that included both cortical and subcortical portions of the limbic system. Glucose metabolism in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens was decreased markedly, and smaller decrements were observed in the caudate and anterior putamen. In addition, cocaine administration produced significant decreases in limbic cortex. Metabolism was decreased in orbitofrontal cortex (areas 11, 12o, 13, 13a, 13b), portions of the gyrus rectus including area 25, entorhinal cortex, and parts of the hippocampal formation. The cortical regions in which functional activity was altered provide dense projections to the nucleus accumbens, and the decreased activity in these projections may be responsible in part for the large alterations in functional activity within the ventral striatum, Decreased metabolism also was evident in the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus, raphe nuclei, and locus ceruleus, The acute cerebral metabolic effects of cocaine in the conscious macaque, therefore, were contained primarily within a set of interconnected limbic regions, including ventral prefrontal cortex, medial temporal regions, the ventral striatal complex, and anterior thalamus. The decreased rates of glucose metabolism reported here resemble decrements found using positron emission tomography in humans. In the rat, by contrast, metabolic activity increased and changes were focused in subcortical regions, The present results represent an important expansion of the neural circuitry on which cocaine acts in the monkey as compared with the rat, and this in turn implies that cocaine affects a broader spectra of behaviors in primates than in rodents.;WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,CTR NEUROBIOL INVEST DRUGS ABUSE,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27157;"Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center";;;"Lyons, David James/AAA-2672-2021; Friedman, David P/G-7842-2011";Friedman, David P/0000-0003-1732-2404;NIDA NIH HHS [DA06829, DA07955, DA09085] Funding Source: Medline;NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA));;;65;99;100;1;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Quantitative electron microscopy was carried out on the posteromedial barrel subfield of mouse somatosensory cortex from postnatal day 4 (P4) when thalamocortical innervation of the barrels is becoming established, through to sexual maturity (>P32), and in adulthood. Both asymmetrical (putatively excitatory) and symmetrical (putatively inhibitory) synapses were present in all layers from P4. The symmetrical synapses were immunoreactive for BABA at all ages, There was a progressive increase in both asymmetrical and symmetrical synapses up to P32, density in all layers increasing 16-fold, with the production of asymmetrical synapses leading and greatly outstripping that of symmetrical. From P32 to P120, the oldest age studied, synaptic numbers declined by 18% to 13 times the P4 level, but this affected predominantly layers II/III, IV and V, and mainly involved asymmetrical synapses. The relative percentage of asymmetrical to symmetrical synapses from P4 to P8 was 57%/43% but at P32 it was 89.5%/10.5% and in adulthood 85.4%/14.6%. These data indicate that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the rodent cortex begins earlier than previously thought, a basis for inhibition being present from the earliest period. Pruning of all synapses occurs well after thalamocortical innervation is established and inhibitory synapses are less affected by the pruning process.;"UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717; CSIC,INST CAJAL,E-28002 MADRID,SPAIN; UNIV ALICANTE,INST NEUROCIENCIAS,SAN JUAN 03550,SPAIN";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Cajal (IC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante (IN); Universitat d'Alacant";;;DEFELIPE, JAVIER/D-1195-2014;DEFELIPE, JAVIER/0000-0001-5484-0660;;;;;67;205;208;0;7;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

This study reports the implementation of a baboon model for blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies (1.5 x 1.5 x 4 mm resolution) on a clinical 3 T-MRI scanner. BOLD fMRI responses to hypercapnic (5% CO2) challenge, 10 Hz flicker visual, and vibrotactile somatosensory-motor stimulations were investigated in baboons anesthetized sequentially with isoflurane and ketamine. Hypercapnia evoked robust BOLD increases. Paralysis was determined to be necessary to achieve reproducible functional activations within and between subjects under our experimental conditions. With optimized anesthetic doses (0.8-1.0% isoflurane or 6-8 mg/kg/h ketamine) and adequate paralysis (vecuronium, 0.2 mg/kg), robust activations were detected in the visual (V), primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory, primary motor (M cortices), supplementary motor area (SMA), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and thalamus (Th). Data were tabulated for 11 trials under isoflurane and 10 trials under ketamine on 5 baboons. S1, S2, M, and V activations were detected in essentially all trials (90-100% of the time, except 82% for S2 under isoflurane and 70% for M under ketamine). LGN activations were detected 64-70% of the time under both anesthetics. SMA and Th activations were detected 36-45% of the time under isoflurane and 60% of the time under ketamine. BOLD percent changes among different structures were slightly higher under ketamine than isoflurane (0.75% versus 0.58% averaging all structures), but none was statistically different (P>0.05). This baboon model offers an opportunity to non-invasively image brain functions and dysfunctions in large non-human primates. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In other respects, the responses of beta2-/- dLGN cells are quantitatively abnormal: the mutation is associated with higher spontaneous and visually evoked firing rates, faster visual response latencies, a preference for higher temporal frequencies, and a trend toward greater contrast sensitivity. The normal response properties in the beta2-/- dLGN show that none of the many effects of the mutation, including disrupted geniculate functional organization and abnormal cholinergic transmission, have any effect on spatial response characteristics and bursting behavior in dLGN neurons.

In addition, this result has important implications for studies of adult neuronal plasticity because it indicates that changes in 'higher-order' areas of the brain can trigger extensive changes in the receptive field characteristics of neurons located earlier in the processing pathway.;"Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA; Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Washington, DC 20057 USA";"Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Georgetown University";Pons, TP (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA.;tpons@wfubmc.edu;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH53369-02, MH11950-01] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS35246-01] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;25;126;126;1;5;NATURE AMERICA INC;NEW YORK;345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA;1097-6256;;;NAT NEUROSCI;Nat.

In the first series of experiments, the virus was injected into the MI forelimb region, and the time-dependent distribution patterns of transsynaptic labeling were analyzed in the frontal lobe with various survivals (2-4 d). Two days after the viral injection, neuronal labeling emerged in the caudal aspects of the nonprimary motor-related areas that are known to project to the MI directly. At the same time, the motor thalamus contained labeled neurons. On the third day, cortical labeling extended into the rostral motor-related areas and, also, prearcuate area 8. Moreover, a number of labeled neurons were located in the internal pallidum and the cerebellar nuclei. At the 4 d postinjection period, neuronal labeling occurred widely in prefrontal areas as well as in the putamen and the cerebellar cortex. In the second series of experiments, the viral injection was made into the MI hindlimb region, and the distribution pattern of prefrontal labeling on the fourth day was compared with that in the forelimb-injection case. The labeled neurons in each prefrontal area were much fewer in the hindlimb-injection case than in the forelimb-injection case. Whereas ventral area 46 was most densely labeled from the forelimb region, only sparse labeling from the hindlimb region was observed in this prefrontal area. The present results suggest the importance of ventral area 46 in the cognitive control of forelimb movements.;"Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838526, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi 3320012, Japan; Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; Natl Inst Infect Dis, Tokyo 1628640, Japan; Nagasaki Univ, Inst Trop Med, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan";"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Juntendo University; National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID); Nagasaki University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)";Miyachi, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, 2-6 Musashidai, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838526, Japan.;miyachi@tmin.ac.jp;;Nambu, Atsushi/0000-0003-2153-5445;;;;;60;70;75;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

VGLUT2 is localized in the cortical terminals of neuronal somas located in the main sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Thus, immunolabeling of cortex with antibodies to VGLUT2 can reveal geniculostriate terminal distributions in species in which connectivity cannot be studied with tract-tracing techniques, permitting broader comparative studies of cortical specializations. Here, we used VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry to compare the organization of geniculostriate afferents in primary visual cortex in hominid primates (humans, chimpanzees, and an orangutan), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaques and vervets), and New World monkeys (squirrel monkeys). The New and Old World monkeys had a broad, dense band of terminal-like labeling in cortical layer 4C, a narrow band of labeling in layer 4A, and additional labeling in layers 2/3 and 6, consistent with results from conventional tract-tracing studies in these species. By contrast, although the hominid primates had a prominent layer 4C band, labeling of layer 4A was sparse or absent. Labeling was also present in layers 2/3 and 6, although labeling of layer 6 was weaker in hominids and possibly more individually variable than in Old and New World monkeys. These findings are consistent with previous observations from cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and a very small number of connectivity studies, suggesting that the projections from the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4A were strongly reduced or eliminated in humans and apes following their evolutionary divergence from the other anthropoid primates.

Our immediate aim was to explore the inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to orientation selectivity, perhaps the most dramatic response property to emerge across the thalamocortical synapse. The broader goal was to understand how inhibitory circuits operate. Using whole-cell recording in cats in vivo, we found that layer 4 contains two populations of inhibitory cells defined by receptive field class-simple and complex. The simple cells were selective for stimulus orientation, whereas the complex cells were not. Our observations help to explain how neurons become sensitive to stimulus orientation and maintain that selectivity as stimulus contrast changes. Overall, the work suggests that different sources of inhibition, either selective for specific features or broadly tuned, interact to provide appropriate representations of elements within the environment.;"Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; Univ A Coruna, Dept Med, La Coruna 15006, Spain; SUNY Optometry, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA; Redwood Neurosci Inst, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA";"University of Southern California; Universidade da Coruna; State University of New York (SUNY) System";Hirsch, JA (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, 3641 Watt Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;jhirsch@usc.edu;Hirsch, Judith/E-9006-2013;Pillai, Cinthi/0000-0002-7662-443X;NEI NIH HHS [EY09593] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;50;145;145;0;5;NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP;NEW YORK;75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA;1097-6256;1546-1726;;NAT NEUROSCI;Nat.

Recently, increased attention has focused on using microstimulation to restore functions as diverse as somatosensation and memory. However, how microstimulation changes the neural substrate is still not fully understood. Microstimulation may cause cortical changes that could either compete with or complement natural neural processes, and could result in neuroplastic changes rendering the region dysfunctional or even epileptic. As part of our efforts to produce neuroprosthetic devices and to further study the effects of microstimulation on the cortex, we stimulated and recorded from microelectrode arrays in the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (area 1) in two awake macaque monkeys. We applied a simple neuroprosthetic microstimulation protocol to a pair of electrodes in the area 1 array, using either random pulses or pulses time-locked to the recorded spiking activity of a reference neuron. This setup was replicated using a computer model of the thalamocortical system, which consisted of 1980 spiking neurons distributed among six cortical layers and two thalamic nuclei. Experimentally, we found that spike-triggered microstimulation induced cortical plasticity, as shown by increased unit-pair mutual information, while random microstimulation did not. In addition, there was an increased response to touch following spike-triggered microstimulation, along with decreased neural variability. The computer model successfully reproduced both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the experimental findings. The physiological findings of this study suggest that even simple microstimulation protocols can be used to increase somatosensory information flow.;"[Song, Weiguo; Kerr, Cliff C.; Lytton, William W.; Francis, Joseph T.] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Physiol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Song, Weiguo; Kerr, Cliff C.; Lytton, William W.; Francis, Joseph T.] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Kerr, Cliff C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Lytton, William W.] Kings Cty Hosp, Dept Neurol, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Lytton, William W.; Francis, Joseph T.] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Robert Furchgott Ctr Neural & Behav Sci, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Lytton, William W.; Francis, Joseph T.] Joint Grad Program Engn SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Lytton, William W.; Francis, Joseph T.] NYU POLY, Brooklyn, NY USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center; University of Sydney; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center";Kerr, CC (corresponding author), Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Physiol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA.;cliffk@neurosim.downstate.edu;;"Francis, Joseph/0000-0002-2874-0452; Song, Weiguo/0000-0001-8415-9286; Lytton, William/0000-0002-3727-2849";DARPA REPAIR Contract [N66001-10-C-2008];DARPA REPAIR Contract;This work was supported by DARPA REPAIR Contract #N66001-10-C-2008.

As brain atlases are essential tools for brain investigation, the objective of the current work was to create the first 3D digital atlas of the mouse lemur brain. For this, a template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, we generated probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and probability maps, as well as imaging tools used to create and manipulate the template, can all be freely downloaded. The atlas was first used to automatically assess regional age-associated cerebral atrophy in a cohort of mouse lemurs previously studied by voxel based morphometry (VBM). Results based on the atlas were in good agreement with the VBM ones, showing age-associated atrophy in the same brain regions such as the insular, parietal or occipital cortices as well as the thalamus or hypothalamus. The atlas was also used as a tool for comparative neuroanatomy. To begin with, we compared measurements of brain regions in our MRI data with histology-based measures from a reference article largely used in previous comparative neuroanatomy studies. We found large discrepancies between our MRI-based data and those of the reference histology-based article. Next, regional brain volumes were compared amongst the mouse lemur and several other mammalian species where high quality volumetric MRI brain atlases were available, including rodents (mouse, rat) and primates (marmoset, macaque, and human). Unlike those based on histological atlases, measures from MRI atlases indicated similar cortical to cerebral volume indices in all primates, including in mouse lemurs, and lower values in mice. On the other hand, white matter to cerebral volume index increased from rodents to small primates (mouse lemurs and marmosets) to macaque, reaching their highest values in humans.;"[Nadkarni, Nachiket A.; Bougacha, Salma; Garin, Clement; Dhenain, Marc; Picq, Jean-Luc] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, UMR 9199,Neurodegenerat Dis Lab, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Nadkarni, Nachiket A.; Bougacha, Salma; Garin, Clement; Dhenain, Marc; Picq, Jean-Luc] Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat CEA, DRF, Inst Francois Jacob, MIRCen, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Bougacha, Salma] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, INSERM, UMR S U1237,GIP Cyceron, Caen, France; [Bougacha, Salma] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Neuropsychol & Imagerie Memoire Humaine, EPHE,INSERM,U1077,CHU Caen, F-14000 Caen, France; [Picq, Jean-Luc] Univ Paris 08, Lab Psychopathol & Neuropsychol, EA 2027, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93000 St Denis, France";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Caen Normandie; CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite Paris-VIII";Dhenain, M (corresponding author), CEA, CNRS, UMR 9199, 18 Route Panorama, F-92265 Fontenay Aux Roses, France.;marc.dhenain@cea.fr;"Garin, Clement M./AAS-3862-2021; Dhenain, Marc/K-5630-2013";"Garin, Clement M./0000-0003-0712-7330; Dhenain, Marc/0000-0001-8804-4101";"France-Alzheimer Association; Plan Alzheimer Foundation; French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program";"France-Alzheimer Association; Plan Alzheimer Foundation; French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program";We thank the France-Alzheimer Association, Plan Alzheimer Foundation and the French Public Investment Bank's ROMANE program for funding this study.;;44;15;15;0;22;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;Jan 15;2019;185;;;;;;85;95;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.010;;;11;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";HC2JN;30326295;Green Submitted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000451628200008;View Full Record in Web of Science

The thalamus receives extensive feedback from the cortex and this influences the firing pattern, synchronization and sensory response mode of relay cells. A crucial question concerns the extent to which the feedback simply controls the state and transmission mode of relay cells and the extent to which the feedback participates in the specific processing of sensory information. Using examples from experiments examining the influence of feedback from the visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we argue that thalamic mechanisms are selectively focused by visually driven feedback to optimize the thalamic contribution to segmentation and global integration. This involves effects on both the temporal and spatial parameters characterizing the responses of LGN cells and includes, for example, motion-driven feedback effects from MT (middle temporal visual area) relayed via layer 6 of V1 (primary visual cortex).;UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, Dept Vis Sci, London EC1V 9EL, England;"University of London; University College London";Sillito, AM (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, Dept Vis Sci, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.;a.sillito@ucl.ac.uk;;;;;;;64;130;135;0;13;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

The results show that the medial extrastriate region above the calcarine sulcus projects mainly to the lateral pulvinar (PL), medial pulvinar (PM), and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. In addition, the dorsal portion of the medial region has connections to the lateral dorsal (LD) as well as to intralaminar nuclei. The dorsolateral extrastriate region projects strongly to the PL and LP nuclei, to the PM and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei, and to the LD and intralaminar nuclei. The lateral extrastriate region above the inferior occipital sulcus (IOS) has strong connections to both the PL and PI nuclei and has minor projections to the PM and oral pulvinar nuclei. The ventrolateral extrastriate region below the IOS projects mainly to the PI nucleus and to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has some projections to the PM nucleus. The ventromedial extrastriate region medial to the occipitotemporal sulcus has strong connections with the ventral and medial sectors of the PI nucleus. This region also projects to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has minor connections to the LP nucleus. Finally, the annectant gyrus projects to the PL nucleus and to the rostral portion of the PI nucleus and has minor connections to the PM nucleus. Thus, the medial and dorsolateral extrastriate regions are related mainly to the PL and LP nuclei as well as to intralaminar nuclei. In contrast, the ventrolateral and ventromedial regions are connected strongly with the PI nucleus. This connectional organization appears to reflect functional differentiation at the cortical level.

Recent studies have suggested that parkinsonism is closely associated with increased amplitude and duration of beta burst activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). How beta burst dynamics are altered from the normal to parkinsonian state across the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) motor network, however, remains unclear. In this study, we simultaneously recorded local field potential activity from the STN, internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and primary motor cortex (M1) in three female rhesus macaques, and characterized how beta burst activity changed as the animals transitioned from normal to progressively more severe parkinsonian states. Parkinsonism was associated with an increased incidence of beta bursts with longer duration and higher amplitude in the low beta band (8-20 Hz) in both the STN and GPi, but not in M1. We observed greater concurrence of beta burst activity, however, across all recording sites (M1, STN, and GPi) in PD. The simultaneous presence of low beta burst activity across multiple nodes of the BGTC network that increased with severity of PD motor signs provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that low beta synchronized oscillations play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of PD. Given its immersion throughout the motor circuit, we hypothesize that this elevated beta-band activity interferes with spatial-temporal processing of information flow in the BGTC network that contributes to the impairment of motor function in PD.;"[Yu, Ying; Sanabria, David Escobar; Wang, Jing; Hendrix, Claudia M.; Zhang, Jianyu; Nebeck, Shane D.; Amundson, Alexia M.; Busby, Zachary B.; Bauer, Devyn L.; Johnson, Luke A.; Vitek, Jerrold L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";Vitek, JL (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Neurol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;vitek004@umn.edu;;"Wang, Jing/0000-0002-9883-4972; Bauer, Devyn/0000-0003-3414-411X; Yu, Ying/0000-0002-5693-0755; Johnson, Luke/0000-0002-9069-1436";NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS058945, R01 NS037019, R01 NS117822, R37 NS077657, P50 NS098573, R01 NS110613] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;68;11;11;0;6;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus also projects to V1, but this input is not well understood. We manipulated lateral pulvinar neural activity in prosimian primates and assessed the effect on supra-granular layers of V1 that project to higher visual cortex. Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields fourfold and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields toward the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations. Excitation of lateral pulvinar after LGN lesion activated supra-granular layer V1 neurons.

There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.;"[Ferster, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Priebe, Nicholas J.] Univ Texas Austin, Neurobiol Sect, Austin, TX 78712 USA";"Northwestern University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin";Ferster, D (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, 2205 Tech Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;ferster@northwestern.edu;;;;;;;148;251;252;4;37;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;1097-4199;;NEURON;Neuron;Feb 28;2008;57;4;;;;;482;497;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.005;;;16;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;270EQ;18304479;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000253703600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Tactile allodynia, in which innocuous tactile stimuli are perceived as painful, is common in patients with CPSP. Previous brain imaging studies have reported plastic changes in brain activity in patients with tactile allodynia after stroke, but a causal relationship between such changes and the symptoms has not been established. We recently developed a non-human primate (macaque) model of CPSP based on thalamic lesions, in which the animals show behavioral changes consistent with the occurrence of tactile allodynia. Here we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging under propofol anesthesia to investigate the changes in brain activation associated with the allodynia in this CPSP model. Before the lesion, innocuous tactile stimuli significantly activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. When behavioral changes were observed after the thalamic lesion, equivalent stimuli significantly activated pain-related brain areas, including the posterior insular cortex (PIC), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Moreover, when either PIC/SII or ACC was pharmacologically inactivated, the signs of tactile allodynia were dampened. Our results show that increased cortical activity plays a role in CPSP-induced allodynia.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, 5-3-1 Koujimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Kita Ku, 1398 Shimami, Niigata, Niigata 9503198, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tsukuba; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Niigata University";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016; Higo, Noriyuki/M-6385-2016";"Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316; Higo, Noriyuki/0000-0002-3448-1696";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants [25351004, 16K01489]; MEXT of Japan [17H05917, 17J03104]; PRESTO of Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25351004, 17H05917, 16K01489, 17J03104] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants; MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); PRESTO of Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";We are grateful to Mr. T.

Pioneering studies on perceptual suppression (PS) described specific local neural network responses in primary visual cortex, thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex of the macaque brain. Yet the neural effects of PS have rarely been studied with intracerebral recordings outside these cortices and simultaneously across distant brain areas. Here, we combined (1) a novel experimental paradigm in which we produced a similar perceptual disappearance and also re-appearance by using visual adaptation with transient contrast changes, with (2) electrophysiological observations from human intracranial electrodes sampling wide brain areas. We focused on broadband high-frequency (50-150 Hz, i.e., gamma) and low-frequency (8-24 Hz) neural activity amplitude modulations related to target visibility and invisibility. We report that low-frequency amplitude modulations reflected stimulus visibility in a larger ensemble of recording sites as compared to broadband gamma responses, across distinct brain regions including occipital, temporal and frontal cortices. Moreover, the dynamics of the broadband gamma response distinguished stimulus visibility from stimulus invisibility earlier in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus than in temporal regions, suggesting a possible role of fronto-insular cortices in top down processing for conscious perception. Finally, we report that in primary visual cortex only low-frequency amplitude modulations correlated directly with perceptual status. Interestingly, in this sensory area broadband gamma was not modulated during PS but became positively modulated after 300 ms when stimuli were rendered visible again, suggesting that local networks could be ignited by top down influences during conscious perception.;"[Vidal, Juan R.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe] INSERM, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Brain Dynam & Cognit Team, U1028,CNRS,UMR5292, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe] Univ Lyon 1, F-69365 Lyon, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France; [Vidal, Juan R.; Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela] CNRS, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, UMR 5105, F-38040 Grenoble, France; [Kahane, Philippe] CHU Grenoble, F-38043 Grenoble, France; [Kahane, Philippe] INSERM, Dept Neurol, U704, F-38043 Grenoble, France";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; CHU Grenoble Alpes; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)";Vidal, JR (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Pierre Mendes France, Lab Psychol & NeuroCognit, CNRS,UMR 5105, Batiment Sci Homme & Math BP 47, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France.;juan.vidal@upmf-grenoble.fr;"Lachaux, Jean-Philippe/K-1681-2017; KAHANE, PHILIPPE/P-5669-2016; Vidal, Juan R/C-7291-2016";Perrone-Bertolotti, Marcela/0000-0001-9981-7042;;;;;102;12;12;0;16;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-1078;;;FRONT PSYCHOL;Front.

Nine healthy subjects were recruited to the study and underwent scanning on a 3T magnet. We were able to define well-known image-forming (optic nerve -> lateral geniculate -> visual cortex) as well as a less known nonimage forming visual pathway from the optic chiasm to the pulvinar, and from the pulvinar to several associative cortical brain regions. Such pathway may allow photic signals to converge on a thalamic region we described recently to be selectively activated during migraine headache.

This differentiation occurs in a layer- and region-specific manner, and the neurons can re-form appropriate corticothalamic connections. We induced synchronous apoptotic degeneration(7,8) of corticothalamic neurons in layer VI of anterior cortex of adult mice and examined the fates of dividing cells within cortex, using markers for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) and progressive neuronal differentiation. Newly made, BrdU-positive cells expressed NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, in regions of cortex undergoing targeted neuronal death and survived for at least 28 weeks. Subsets of BrdU+ precursors expressed Doublecortin, a protein found exclusively in migrating neurons(9,10), and Hu, an early neuronal marker(11,12).

Some studies have suggested that functional and structural impairments in the default mode network may play a role in explaining these disorders. In contrast, others have proposed that dysfunctions in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit involving striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus may be the main underlying mechanism. Here, we provide the first report of structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting the nodes of the mesocircuit and the default mode network in 8 patients with DOC. We found evidence of significant damage to subcortico-cortical and cortico-cortical fibers, which were more severe in vegetative state patients and correlated with clinical severity as determined by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. In contrast, fiber tracts interconnecting subcortical nodes were not significantly impaired. Lastly, we found significant damage in all fiber tracts connecting the precuneus with cortical and subcortical areas. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the default mode network and most importantly the precuneus - and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the neural basis of the DOC.

We have begun studies of the monkey visual system to investigate the location and nature of these changes as well as to answer general questions about the effects of aging on neural structure and function. We began with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) because it is the main structure through which visual information passes on the way to cortex and because the parallel parvicellular and magnocellular pathways are most easily identified and studied in the LGN. In the present experiment, we determined the sizes, densities, and numbers of LGN neurons in young-adult (5 to 12.5 years) and old (23 to 27.5 years) rhesus monkeys. The measures were corrected for tissue shrinkage, and stereological procedures were used that yield unbiased estimates. In young-adult monkeys, neuron densities were lower in the magnocellular layers (about 14,000/mm3) than in the parvicellular layers (23,000/mm3). Neuron density increased about 28% from anterior to posterior in both types of layers. There was an average of approximately 1,267,000 neurons in the parvicellular layers and 148,000 neurons in the magnocellular layers; however, there was substantial variability (1.9-fold) among five brains studied. Aging produced a statistically significant decrease in neuron density in both the magnocellular (29% average decrease) and parvicellular (41% average decrease) layers. However, there was no significant loss of neurons. Rather, the density decrease was due to a small (nonsignificant) decrease in the number of neurons combined with a small (nonsignificant) increase in LGN volume. The increase in LGN volume was due to a significant increase in neuron soma-size and proportional increases in the volume of glial cells, blood vessels, and neuropil. These results, together with those of other studies, suggest that the effects of aging on the primate visual pathway from retina through striate cortex are relatively subtle. It is possible that the major neural changes occur more centrally. Alternatively, individual differences in the effects of aging may require much larger samples or prior screening to observe consistent changes.

The mismatch response, or mismatch negativity (MMN), is a neurophysiologic response to stimulus change. In humans and other animals, the MMN may underlie the ability to discriminate acoustic differences, a fundamental aspect of auditory perception. 2. This study investigated the role of the thalamus in the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in guinea pigs. Electrodes were placed in the caudomedial (nonprimary) and ventral (primary) subdivisions of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus). Surface epidural electrodes were placed at the midline and over the temporal lobe. The MMN was elicited by a deviant stimulus (2,450-Hz tone burst) embedded in a sequence of standard stimuli (2,300-Hz tone bursts). 3. A tone-evoked MMN was present in nonprimary thalamus but was absent in the primary thalamus. Surface-recorded MMNs were measured at the midline but not over the temporal lobe. The correspondence between nonprimary thalamic responses and midline surface potentials, and between primary thalamic responses and temporal surface potentials, is consistent with data reported for the auditory middle latency responses in guinea pigs. 4. The results demonstrate that the nonprimary auditory thalamus contributes to the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in the guinea pig. Furthermore, the data indicate that the guinea pig is a feasible model for investigating central auditory processes underlying acoustic discrimination.;"NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT NEUROBIOL & PHYSIOL,EVANSTON,IL 60208; NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT OTOLARYNGOL,EVANSTON,IL 60208";"Northwestern University; Northwestern University";KRAUS, N (corresponding author), NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT COMMUN SCI & DISORDERS,EVOKED POTENTIALS LAB,2299 N CAMPUS DR,EVANSTON,IL 60208, USA.;;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC-00264] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;87;150;151;0;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The development of a pseudotyped lentiviral vector with the property of retrograde infection allows us to introduce foreign genes into neurons that are localized in regions innervating the site of vector injection. Here, we report the efficiency of retrograde gene transfer of a recently developed FuG-E pseudotyped lentiviral vector in the primate brain by comparing its transduction pattern with that of the parental FuG-C pseudotyped vector. After injection of the FuG-E vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum of macaque monkeys, many GFP-immunoreactive neurons were found in regions projecting to the striatum, such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Quantitative analysis revealed that in all regions, the number of neurons retrogradely transduced with the FuG-E vector was larger than in the FuG-C vector injection case. It was also confirmed that the FuG-E vector displayed explicit neuronal specificity to the same extent as the FuG-C vector. This vector might promote approaches to pathway-selective gene manipulation and provide a powerful tool for effective gene therapy trials against neurological disorders through enhanced retrograde delivery.

The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that Occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected Current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.;"[Lempka, Scott F.; Miocinovic, Svjetlana; Johnson, Matthew D.; McIntyre, Cameron C.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA; [Lempka, Scott F.; Miocinovic, Svjetlana; McIntyre, Cameron C.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Vitek, Jerrold L.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Neurosci, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA";"Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Case Western Reserve University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation";McIntyre, CC (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Biomed Engn, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.;mcintyc@ccf.org;Johnson, Matthew D/B-6276-2015;"Johnson, Matthew D/0000-0001-9686-5540; Miocinovic, Svjetlana/0000-0001-9237-0276";"National Institutes of Health [R01 NS047388, R01 NS037019]; United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in the Areas of National Need (GAANN)";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Department of Education Graduate Assistance in the Areas of National Need (GAANN)(US Department of Education)";The authors would like to thank Justin Williams for his helpful discussion on in vivo EIS measurements and model analysis.

In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for >85% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina.;"[Sincich, Lawrence C.; Horton, Jonathan C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Salk Institute";Sincich, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, 10 Koret Way, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.;sincichl@vision.ucsf.edu;Sharpee, Tatyana O/E-8663-2010;"Sharpee, Tatyana/0000-0002-7483-5081; Horton, Jonathan/0000-0002-3952-435X";"National Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-0712852]; National Eye Institute [EY10217, EY02162]; National Institute of Mental Health [MH068904]; Alfred P.

Hence, thalamically projecting LCN neurons in the monkey are located in the rostral portion of the nucleus and comprise about one-third of the total population. Comparison of these data with reports in the literature imply that, unlike the cat, the major projection from LCN in monkeys is to the mesencephalon rather than to the thalamus.";SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, NEUROSURG RES LABS, 766 IRVING AVE, 3118 WEISKOTTEN HALL, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";;;;Apkarian, A.

Forward connections are involved in the representation of retinal images, whereas feedback pathways may play a role in the selection and interpretation of visual information. To examine the synaptic mechanisms of forward and feedback connections between primary and secondary visual cortical areas directly, we have performed intracellular recordings in slices of rat visual cortex. Irrespective of stimulus intensity and membrane potential, 78% (45/58) of the cells in striate cortex activated by feedback input showed monosynaptic responses that were depolarizing only, and inhibitory inputs were evident merely as a slight acceleration in the decay of EPSPs. In contrast, in 89% (17/19) of the cells, stimulation of forward input evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), followed by disynaptic, hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs followed by IPSPs also were recorded after stimulation of local connections within primary visual cortex (92%, 12/13) and after activation of thalamocortical input (91%, 10/11). These results suggest that the synaptic organization of feedback connections are distinct from forward, local, and thalamocortical circuits. The findings further indicate that intracortical back projections exert modulatory influences via synaptic mechanisms in which weak inhibitory input is strongly dominated by excitation.;WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,ST LOUIS,MO 63110;Washington University (WUSTL);;;;;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY005935, EY05935] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;73;111;111;0;3;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Manipulating visual experience in kittens by the induction of squint leads to the emergence of ocular dominance columns with a Larger size and larger column-to-column spacing than in normally raised animals. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is presently unknown. Theory suggests that experience cannot influence the spacing of columns if the development proceeds through purely Hebbian mechanisms. Here we study a developmental model in which Hebbian mechanisms are complemented by activity-dependent regulation of the total strength of afferent synapses converging onto a cortical neurone. We show that this model implies an influence of visual experience on the spacing of ocular dominance columns and provides a conceptually simple explanation for the emergence of larger sized columns in squinting animals. Assuming that during development cortical neurones become active in local groups, which we call co-activated cortical domains (CCDs), ocular dominance segregation is controlled by the size of these groups: (1) Size and spacing of ocular dominance columns are proportional to the size sigma of CCDs. (2) There is a critical size sigma* of CCDs such that ocular dominance columns form if sigma < <sigma>* but do not form spontaneously if sigma > sigma*. This critical size of CCDs is determined by the correlation functions of activity patterns in the two eyes and specifies the influence of experience on ocular dominance segregation. We show that sigma* is larger with squint than with normal visual experience. Since experimental evidence indicates that the size of CCDs decreases during development, ocular dominance columns are predicted to form earlier and with a larger spacing in squinters compared to normal animals.

Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.;SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;;;;;;;;40;154;158;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN-FEB;2000;17;1;;;;;55;62;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800171056;;;8;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";294TT;10750826;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000085927000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is anterogradely transported (e.g., from cell bodies to nerve terminals) in both rat and non-human primate (NHP) brain. In contrast, AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) is retrogradely transported from terminals to neuronal cell bodies in the rat brain. However, the directionality of axonal transport of AAV6 in the NHP brain has not been determined. In this study, two Cynomolgus macaques received an infusion of AAV6 harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum (caudate and putamen) by magnetic resonance (MR)-guided convection-enhanced delivery. One month after infusion, immunohistochemical staining of brain sections revealed a striatal GFP expression that corresponded well with MR signal observed during gene delivery. As shown previously in rats, GFP expression was detected throughout the prefrontal, frontal and parietal cortex, as well as the substantia nigra pars compacta and thalamus, indicating retrograde transport of the vector in NHP. AAV6-GFP preferentially transduced neurons, although a few astrocytes were also transduced. Transduction of non-neuronal cells in the brain was associated with the upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex-II and lymphocytic infiltration as previously observed with AAV1 and AAV9. This contrasts with highly specific neuronal transduction in the rat brain. Retrograde axonal transport of AAV6 from a single striatal infusion permits efficient transduction of cortical neurons in significant tissue volumes that otherwise would be difficult to achieve.;"[San Sebastian, W.; Samaranch, L.; Heller, G.; Kells, A.

This classification is supported by the. finding that response linearity is bimodally distributed across neurons in area V1 of anesthetized animals. However, recent studies suggest that such bimodal distribution may not reflect two neuronal types but a nonlinear relationship between the membrane potential and the spike output. A main limitation of these previous studies is that they measured response linearity in anesthetized animals, where the distance between the neuronal membrane potential and the spike threshold is artificially increased by anesthesia. Here, we measured V1 response linearity in the awake brain and its correlation with the neuronal spontaneous. ring rate, which is related to the distance between membrane potential and threshold. Our results demonstrate that response linearity is bimodally distributed in awake V1 but that it is poorly correlated with spontaneous. ring rate. In contrast, the spontaneous. ring rate is best correlated to the response selectivity and response latency to stimuli.;"[Chen, Yao; Anand, Sanjiv] SUNY, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY USA; [Martinez-Conde, Susana; Macknik, Stephen L.] Barrow Neurol Inst, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; [Bereshpolova, Yulia; Swadlow, Harvey A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT USA; [Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Community College; SUNY Maritime College; SUNY Optometry; Barrow Neurological Institute; University of Connecticut; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Community College; SUNY Maritime College; SUNY Optometry";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), 33 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;Macknik, Stephen L./H-7704-2019;Macknik, Stephen L./0000-0002-3143-9230;"NIH-EY [14345]; NIH-NS [059753]; The Research Foundation";"NIH-EY(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH-NS; The Research Foundation";We would like to thank Nadia Gamez Gomez and Javier Cubo Villalba for helping in the development of analysis software.

Interposed between these two sites is a large transitional field. We have earlier demonstrated experimentally in rats with H-3-thymidine autoradiography that this transitional field is a stratified structure composed of discrete layers of migrating and sojourning cells, and fiber bands. Here we show that the different layers of the stratified transitional field are identifiable without experimental procedures in the developing human cerebral cortex and that there are conspicuous regional differences in its stratification. At the peak of its development, the stratified transitional field contains three fibrous bands in an inside-out order: the commissural fibers of the corpus callosum, the thalamocortical and corticofugal projection fibers, and the expanding white matter. There are regional differences in the thickness of these fibrous layers as well as in the number and configuration of the perikaryal layers. This preview focuses on laminar differences of the transitional fields of the agranular frontal lobe and the granular parietal and occipital lobes. At the latter sites, but not in the frontal lobe, there is a distinctive multi-layered band, the honeycomb matrix, where radially oriented fiber columns are sandwiched between two perikaryal sublayers and are separated from one another by radially oriented cells. We postulate that the radial fiber columns of the honeycomb matrix are composed of topographically organized thalamocortical fibers and that the unspecified young neurons acquire their enduring topographic identity by making selective contacts with tagged fibers here before they resume their radial or tangential migration to the cortical plate.;Dev Neurobiol Lab, Indianapolis, IN 46278 USA;;Altman, J (corresponding author), Dev Neurobiol Lab, 7715 W 88th St, Indianapolis, IN 46278 USA.;;;;;;;;21;18;18;0;3;KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0300-4864;;;J NEUROCYTOL;J.

These are important for the accurate location of visual objects in extrapersonal space, It can be predicted that these areas will show increased activation during the performance of eye movements at high frequency. In the present study PET and measurements of the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used as indirect measures of neural activity. Two independent groups of normal volunteers performed large-amplitude self-generated eye movements in complete darkness, thus removing the confounding effects of visual stimulation on parietooccipital activation. The first group (group A; n = 5) served as a hypothesis-generating group and the second group (group B; n = 4) served as a hypothesis-testing group, The data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping at a significance level corrected for multiple comparisons (group A, Z > 4.08; group B, Z > 4.04), Significant rCBF increases were found for both groups in the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, cerebellar vermis and putamina/thalami. Additionally, activation was found in the cunei in the posterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus, Also, the extraocular muscles were activated and, as a consequence of the partial volume effect, projected to the orbitofrontal cortices, At a less conservative threshold, activation was found close to the intraparietal sulci on the left side (Z = 3.91, P = 0.09) and right side (Z = 3.33, P = 0.42), The locations of these areas were confirmed in group B with reference to high-resolution structural MRI scans. The activation of the parieto-occipital cortex without overt visual stimuli is interpreted as the result of neural activity related to the reception of efferent copies of motor commands and/or the activation of neurons coding for eye position relative to the orbits.

Their responses to various visual stimuli and to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were characterized. In retrograde double-labelling experiments, the pretectal projections to the LP-P and to the LGN were tested for possible overlap. Forty-five neurons were antidromically activated from the LP-P; 55 % of them could also be activated orthodromically from the optic chiasm. Most antidromically activated neurons responded to rapid movements of large textured visual stimuli as well as to 'on' or 'off' visual stimulation with short bursts. When stimulated with a slowly moving, large, structured visual stimulus, most cells showed a slight but significant activity increase. None of the neurons projecting to the LP-P was also activated antidromically from the LGN. Thus, the two populations are separate. This is supported by the results from the retrograde double-labelling experiments. None of the LP-P projecting neurons showed any directional selectivity to slow movements of large visual stimuli, a property by which pretectal neurons projecting to the inferior olive are characterized. Thus, neurons projecting to the LP-P do not bifurcate to the inferior olive. Response properties of neurons projecting to the LP-P were very similar to those of the 'jerk' neurons described by Schweigart and Hoffmann (Exp. Brain Res., 91, 273-283, 1992); therefore we believe them to be identical. Jerk neurons are known to react not only to rapid image shifts with short high-frequency bursts, but also to saccadic eye movements in the light.

After a warning stimulus was presented, a Go or NoGo stimulus was presented with equal probability. Both auditory and visual warning stimuli activated the midbrain. thalamus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) extending to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The warning-related activation in the pre-SMA and thalamus was greater when warnings were followed by Go events with faster reaction times than when followed by events with slower reaction times. The midbrain, thalamus. and ACC are known to be associated with vigilance or intrinsic alertness, and the pre-SMA is involved in movement selection and preparation. Thus, the warning effect may be partly mediated by the potentiation of the pre-SMA through the midbrain-thalamus-ACC alerting network (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society All rights reserved.;"[Yanaka, Hisakazu T.; Saito, Daisuke N.; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Dept Cerebral Res, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Yanaka, Hisakazu T.; Sadato, Norihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies Sokendai, Dept Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan; [Yanaka, Hisakazu T.; Sadato, Norihiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Inst Sci & Technol Soc RISTEX, Tokyo, Japan; [Uchiyama, Yuji] Toyota Cent Res & Dev Labs Inc, Nagakute, Aichi 48011, Japan; [Yanaka, Hisakazu T.; Saito, Daisuke N.; Sadato, Norihiro] Univ Fukui, Biomed Imaging Res Ctr, Fukui 910, Japan; [Yanaka, Hisakazu T.; Saito, Daisuke N.] Univ Fukui, Res & Educ Program Life Sci, Fukui 910, Japan";"National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Toyota Central R&D Labs Inc; University of Fukui; University of Fukui";Sadato, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Dept Cerebral Res, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.;;Uchiyama, Yuji/GVS-0186-2022;"Uchiyama, Yuji/0000-0003-1581-8668; Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17100003, 21220005]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17100003] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";The authors would like to thank Dr H.

Due to the putative importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in symptomatology, fibers that connect the OFC, SCT lesion, and either the thalamus or brainstem were investigated with two-tensor tractography using an unscented Kalman filter approach. From this dataset, fibers were warped to Montreal Neurological Institute space, and probability maps with center-of-mass analysis were subsequently generated. In comparing fibers from the same OFC region, including medial OFC (mOFC), central OFC (cOFC), and lateral OFC (lOFC), the area of divergence for fibers connected with the thalamus versus the brainstem is posterior to the anterior commissure. At the anterior commissure, fibers connected with the thalamus run dorsal to those connected with the brainstem. As OFC fibers travel through the ventral aspect of the internal capsule, lOFC fibers are dorsal to cOFC and mOFC fibers. Using neuroanatomical comparison, tracts coursing between the OFC and thalamus are likely part of the anterior thalamic radiations, while those between the OFC and brainstem likely belong to the medial forebrain bundle. These data support the involvement of the OFC in OCD and may be relevant to creating differential lesional procedures of specific tracts or to developing deep brain stimulation programming paradigms.;"[Papadimitriou, George; Liang, Lichen; Makris, Nikos] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Papadimitriou, George; Liang, Lichen; Makris, Nikos] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yang, Jimmy C.; Eskandar, Emad N.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Dougherty, Darin D.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Eckbo, Ryan; Bouix, Sylvain; Rathi, Yogesh; Shenton, Martha; Kubicki, Marek] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Psychiat Neuroimaging Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Yang, Jimmy C.; Dougherty, Darin D.; Bouix, Sylvain; Rathi, Yogesh; Shenton, Martha; Kubicki, Marek; Eskandar, Emad N.; Makris, Nikos] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Yeterian, Edward H.] Colby Coll, Dept Psychol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Shenton, Martha] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Brockton, MA USA";"Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Colby College; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Harvard University; VA Boston Healthcare System";Makris, N (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Morphometr Anal, A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;nikos@cma.mgh.harvard.edu;"Dougherty, Darin D./G-9896-2012; Shenton, Martha/V-8780-2019";Bouix, Sylvain/0000-0003-1326-6054;" [R01DA027804];  [R21EB016449]";"; ";R01DA027804 (NM), R21EB016449 (NM);;72;5;5;0;9;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1931-7557;1931-7565;;BRAIN IMAGING BEHAV;Brain Imaging Behav.;JUN;2015;9;2;;;;;342;352;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-014-9314-z;;;11;Neuroimaging;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;CI7TB;25103312;Green Submitted, Green Accepted;;;19.07.23;WOS:000354966600019;View Full Record in Web of Science

These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations. The differential laminar distributions of neurons projecting to the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus suggest that these structures may receive independent types of information from the prefrontal cortex.;"EDITH NOURSE ROGERS MEM VET ADM HOSP, BEDFORD, MA 01730 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BETH ISRAEL HOSP, HARVARD NEUROL UNIT, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center";YETERIAN, EH (corresponding author), COLBY COLL, DEPT PSYCHOL, WATERVILLE, ME 04901 USA.;;;;PHS HHS [16841] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;93;48;48;0;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

In order to optogenetically investigate the large and complex primate brain, an optical-/electrical probe, or optrode, must be inserted deeply, which requires the optrode to be not only long and stiff, but also sharp and smooth to reduce possible tissue damage. This study presents a tungsten microelectrode-based optrode that encloses optical fibers within its insulation glass. Optical fibers and a tungsten wire were tightly bound to each other and integrally coated with a smooth, thin layer of glass. This design satisfied the structural requirements for use in deep brain structures. The performance of the optrode was then examined in the thalamus of the rat and macaque monkeys which were injected with lentiviral vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-EYFP) transgene. With fluorescence measurements via the optical fiber, ChR2-EYFP expression was detected clearly in vivo, which was confirmed by histological analysis in the rat. With photostimulation and extracellular recording, photo-responsive single-unit activities were isolated in the monkeys. The depth distribution of these units and the peak of the EYFP fluorescence profile overlapped consistently with each other. Thus, by developing a new probe, optogenetic methodology was successfully applied to a primate subcortical structure. This smooth glass-coated optrode is a promising tool for chronic in vivo experiments with various research targets including deep brain structures in behaving monkeys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Since the human circadian timing system cannot be studied experimentally, we have used another primate, the macaque monkey, to help provide insight into the organization of the human circadian system. The retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) in the monkey projects to the SCN, the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, and the retrochiasmatic area in a pattern very similar to that in the rat. The monkey SCN has a population of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing (VIP+) neurons in a zone that overlaps the RHT termination and the termination of neuropeptide Y-containing (NPY+) axons arising in the IGL. This zone is surrounded by a population of vasopressin-containing (VP+) neurons. The human SCN is similar to that of other mammals with populations of VIP+ and VP+ neurons, but it differs in having a large population of neurotensin-containing (NT+) neurons that extends over the entire nucleus, and a moderate population of NPY+ neurons located centrally in the nucleus in the presumed area of RHT termination. The lateral geniculate nucleus in the monkey and human is quite different from that in rodents, but contains an area in the pregeniculate nucleus that receives bilateral retinal projections in the monkey and is characterized in both the monkey and human by a population of NPY+ neurons and a plexus of enkephalin- and substance P-containing axons. This nucleus appears homologous to the rodent IGL.;"UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PSYCHIAT,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT NEUROL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261; UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT BEHAV NEUROSCI,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";MOORE, RY (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,CTR NEUROSCI,BST W1657,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.;;Jansen, Heiko T./A-5770-2008;Jansen, Heiko T./0000-0003-0178-396X;;;;;15;50;52;0;1;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320;0748-7304;;;J BIOL RHYTHM;J.

In the current study we reveal features of the organization of the pulvinar complex in galagos by examining superior colliculus (SC) projections to this structure and comparing them with staining patterns of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT2. Cholera toxin subunit (CTB), Fluoro-ruby (FR), and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were placed in topographically different locations within the SC. Our results showed multiple topographically organized patterns of projections from the SC to several divisions of the pulvinar complex. At least two topographically distributed projections were found within the lateral region of the pulvinar complex, and two less obvious topographical projection patterns were found within the caudomedial region, in zones that stain darkly for VGLUT2. The results, considered in relation to recent observations in tree shrews and squirrels, suggest that parts of the organizational scheme of the pulvinar complex in primates are present in rodents and other mammals.

It has been thought that the thalamus prevents the relay of sensory information to cortex during sleep, but the consequences for cortical responses to sensory signals in this physiological state remain unclear. We recorded from two auditory cortical areas downstream of the thalamus in naturally sleeping marmoset monkeys. Single neurons in primary auditory cortex either increased or decreased their responses during sleep compared with wakefulness. In lateral belt, a secondary auditory cortical area, the response modulation was also bidirectional and showed no clear systematic depressive effect of sleep. When averaged across neurons, sound-evoked activity in these two auditory cortical areas was surprisingly well preserved during sleep. Neural responses to acoustic stimulation were present during both slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep, were repeatedly observed over multiple sleep cycles, and demonstrated similar discharge patterns to the responses recorded during wakefulness in the same neuron. Our results suggest that the thalamus is not as effective a gate for the flow of sensory information as previously thought. At the cortical stage, a novel pattern of activation/deactivation appears across neurons. Because the neural signal reaches as far as secondary auditory cortex, this leaves open the possibility of altered sensory processing of auditory information during sleep.;"[Issa, Elias B.; Wang, Xiaoqin] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA";Johns Hopkins University;Wang, XQ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Lab Auditory Neurophysiol, 720 Rutland Ave,Traylor 410, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.;xiaoqin.wang@jhu.edu;;Issa, Elias/0000-0002-5387-7207;"National Institutes of Health [R01 DC-03180]; Whitaker Fellowship";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitaker Fellowship";"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 DC-03180 ( X.

Twelve male subjects were selected for DSC perfusion MR imaging (age 4-8 years). The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) images were obtained by post-processing software. The values of rCBV and rCBF were recorded from the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, head of caudate nucleus, posterior limb of internal capsule, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellar, semioval area and splenium of the corpus callosum. The figures of rCBV and rCBF can clearly demonstrate the hemodynamic differences in various cerebral parts. It has been noted that rCBV and rCBF values have no significant difference between the right and left hemisphere (P > 0.05). The values of rCBF from cerebral cortex were significantly higher than that of white matter (P < 0.05). The values of rCBF were different (P < 0.05) at frontal cortex, parietal cortex and occipital cortex.

After s.c. inoculation, the dorsal column was spared, otherwise the spread was similar to that following i.m. inoculations. 3. After i.p. inoculation, virus spread in the spinal cord bilaterally, mainly along spinothalamic and central autonomic pathways. The peripheral motoneurons were conspicuously spared, even in the i.m. inoculation mode. In the brain stem, B virus antigen appeared bilaterally, at multiple sites. In the cerebrum, virus infected cells appeared first in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the motor cortex. The mode of spread from spinal levels was mainly orthograde along the ascending systems (dorsal columns, spinothalamic, spinoreticular tracts), but also retrograde along descending systems (pyramidal tract, central autonomic pathways).

Primates have traditionally been used in these studies because of their ability to perform more complex behaviors closely akin to those of humans, a desirable prerequisite since our ultimate aim is to elucidate the neuronal correlates of human behaviors. A wealth of knowledge has accumulated on the sensory and motor systems such as vision, audition, and eye movements. For more demanding behaviors where the main focus has been on attention, recordings in awake primates have begun to yield valuable data on the centers of the brain that are reactive to different attributes of this behavior. As a result, various hypotheses of the origin and distribution of attentional effects have evolved. For instance, visual attentional effects have been described not only in the higher cortical area (W) but also in areas earlier in the visual pathway which presumably involve a feedback mechanism in the latter region. Here we outline the ways in which we have successfully used these methods to make single-cell recordings in awake macaques to show how certain behavioral paradigms affect neurons of the thalamus (with emphasis on the lateral geniculate nucleus). As we have done with established techniques these methods can be readily adapted to incorporate most behaviors needed to be tested and allow recordings to be made in virtually any part of the brain.

Both similarities and differences were found. Maximal order of branching, branching angles, topological distribution of branches and boutons are similar for all axons, indicating strong constraints in arbor formation. CCC and MTC axons are indistinguishable for total arbor length and number of branches, although these parameters can vary across individual axons of each group. MTC axons have longer and bouton-richer end-branches (the 'transmission compartment') while, in CCC axons, proximal, boutonless branches (the 'conduction compartment') predominate. Therefore, the two classes of axons appear to he specialized for performing different types of operations, in agreement with the available electrophysiological data and computer simulations. Differences in the length of branches were also observed between MTC axons of normal and 'barrelless' mice, suggesting that this parameter can be regulated by conditions at the terminal sites.;"Univ Lausanne, Inst Cell Biol & Morphol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland; Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, Sect Neuroanat & Brain Dev, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden";"University of Lausanne; Karolinska Institutet";Innocenti, GM (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Cell Biol & Morphol, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Giorgio.Innocenti@neuro.ki.se;;;;;;;49;34;34;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

To determine whether a homologous metabolic pattern is also present in nonhuman primate models of parkinsonism, 11 adult macaque monkeys with parkinsonism secondary to chronic systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 12 age-matched healthy animals were scanned with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). A subgroup comprising five parkinsonian and six control animals was used to identify a parkinsonism-related pattern (PRP). For validation, analogous topographies were derived from other subsets of parkinsonian and control animals. The PRP topography was characterized by metabolic increases in putamen/pallidum, thalamus, pons, and sensorimotor cortex, as well as reductions in the posterior parietal-occipital region. Pattern expression was significantly elevated in parkinsonian relative to healthy animals (P < 0.00001). Parkinsonism-related topographies identified in the other derivation sets were very similar, with significant pairwise correlations of region weights (r> 0.88; P < 0.0001) and subject scores (r> 0.74; P < 0.01). Moreover, pattern expression in parkinsonian animals correlated with motor ratings (r> 0.71; P< 0.05). Thus, homologous parkinsonism-related metabolic networks are demonstrable in PD patients and in monkeys with experimental parkinsonism. Network quantification may provide a useful biomarker for the evaluation of new therapeutic agents in preclinical models of PD.

This issue was investigated for the marmoset monkey by recording from 55 single tactile-sensitive neurons in the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) with a projection to either SI or SII, identified with the use of the antidromic collision technique. Neurons activated from the hand and distal forearm were classified according to their peripheral source of input and characterized in terms of their functional capacities to determine whether the direct thalamic input can account for tactile processing in both SI and SII. Both the SI- and SII-projecting samples contained a slowly adapting (SA) class of neurons, sensitive to static skin displacement, and purely dynamically sensitive tactile neurons that could be subdivided into two classes. One was most sensitive to high-frequency (greater than or equal to 100 Hz) cutaneous vibration whose input appeared to be derived from Pacinian sources, while the other was sensitive to lower frequency vibration (less than or equal to 100 Hz) or trains of rectangular mechanical pulse stimuli, that appeared to receive its input from rapidly adapting (RA) afferent fibers presumed to be associated with intradermal tactile receptors. There appeared to be no systematic differences in functional capacities between SI- and SII-projecting neurons of each of these three classes, based on receptive field characteristics, on the form of stimulus-response relations, and on measures derived from these relations. These measures included threshold and responsiveness values, bandwidths of vibrational sensitivity, and the capacity for responding to cutaneous vibrotactile stimuli with phase-locked, temporally patterned impulse activity. The analysis indicates that low-threshold, high-acuity tactile information is conveyed directly to both SI and SII from overlapping regions within the thalamic VP nucleus. This direct confirmation of a parallel functional projection to both SI and SII in the marmoset is consistent with our separate studies at the cortical level that demonstrate first, that tactile responsiveness in SII largely survives the SI inactivation and second, that SI responsiveness is largely independent of SII. It therefore reinforces the evidence that SI and SII occupy a hierarchically equivalent network for tactile processing.;Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;University of New South Wales Sydney;Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;;Zhang, Shi Ping/G-9793-2013;Zhang, Shi Ping/0000-0002-6413-5778;;;;;86;39;40;0;1;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

In three experiments using blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural substrates of acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in which certain sounds can produce an intense somatosensory tingling sensation in a patient with a thalamic lesion. Compared with nine normal controls, the first experiment showed that the patient had a threefold greater BOLD response to sounds in the parietal operculum, the location of secondary somatosensory cortex. We hypothesized that this abnormal opercular activity might be the neural substrate of the patient's synesthesia. Supporting this hypothesis, the second experiment demonstrated that sounds that produced no somatosensation did not evoke a BOLD response in the operculum, while sounds that produced strong somatosensations evoked large BOLD responses. These abnormal responses may have resulted from plasticity induced by the loss of somatosensory inputs. Consistent with this idea, in the third experiment, BOLD responses to somatosensory stimulation were significantly weaker in the patient's operculum than in normal controls. These experiments demonstrate a double dissociation in the patient's secondary somatosensory cortex (increased responses to auditory stimulation and decreased responses to somatosensory stimulation), and suggest both that stroke-induced plasticity can result in abnormal connections between sensory modalities that are normally separate, and that synesthesia can be caused by inappropriate connections between nearby cortical territories.;"[Beauchamp, Michael S.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ro, Tony] CUNY City Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Ro, Tony] CUNY City Coll, Program Congnit Neurosci, New York, NY 10031 USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY)";Beauchamp, MS (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 6431 Fannin St,Suite G-550, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;"Michael.S.Beauchamp@uth.tmc.edu; tro@ccny.cuny.edu";Beauchamp, Michael/AAK-9813-2020;Beauchamp, Michael/0000-0002-7599-9934;;;;;39;46;47;0;10;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

However, as response properties of the mechanoreceptive afferent fibers supplying the skin have not been characterized for this primate, the present study was undertaken to classify fibers innervating the glabrous skin of the marmoset hand and determine whether they resembled those described for other mammalian species, including cat, macaque monkey, and human subjects. Forty-seven tactile afferent fibers with receptive fields (RFs) on the glabrous skin of the hand were isolated in fine median and ulnar nerve strands. Controlled tactile stimuli, including static indentation and skin vibration, were used to classify fibers. Twenty-six (55%) responded to static indentation in a sustained manner and were designated slowly adapting (SA) fibers, while 21 (45%) were selectively sensitive to the dynamic components of the stimulus. The SA fibers had well-defined boundaries to their RFs, lacked spontaneous activity in most cases (23/26 fibers), had an irregular pattern of discharge to static skin indentation, and displayed graded response levels as a function of indentation amplitude, attributes that were consistent with the properties of slowly adapting type I (SAI) fibers described in other species. The dynamically sensitive afferent fibers could be subdivided into two distinct functional classes, based on their responses to vibrotactile stimulation. The majority (15/21) responded best to lower frequency vibration (similar to 10-50 Hz) and had small RFs, whereas the second class responded preferentially to higher frequency vibration (50-700 Hz) with maximal sensitivity at similar to 200-300 Hz. These two classes resembled, respectively, the rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian corpuscle-related (PC) fiber classes found in other species, and like them, responded to vibration with tightly phase-locked patterns of response over a wide range of frequencies. The results demonstrate that the functional classes of tactile afferent fibers that supply the glabrous skin in the marmoset monkey appear to correspond with those described previously for the cat and macaque monkey, and are similar to those supplying the human hand and fingers, although the SA fibers in the human hand appear to fall into two classes, the SAI and SAII fibers. With the increasing use of the marmoset monkey as a primate model for somatosensory system studies, these data now allow tactile neurons identified at central locations, such as the cerebral cortex and thalamus, to be classified in relation to inputs from the peripheral classes identified in the present study.;Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;University of New South Wales Sydney;Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;;;;;;;;69;25;25;0;9;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Visual responses were recorded from neurones in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in two species of New World monkeys - the diurnal squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the nocturnal owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatis). Recording sites were reconstructed in postmortem tissue and comparisons were made between the response properties of magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 2. Receptive fields were characterized with both white noise and drifting gratings. We found that most of the differences between magnocellular and parvocellular neurones that have been described in the macaque monkey hold for the squirrel monkey and owl monkey. In squirrel monkey and owl monkey, receptive fields of magnocellular neurones were larger than those of parvocellular neurones at similar eccentricities. Although visual responses in the owl monkey were significantly slower than in the squirrel monkey, in both species magnocellular neurones differed from parvocellular neurones in that their responses (1) had higher contrast gains, (2) tended to peak at higher temporal frequencies (but with considerable overlap), (3) had shorter response latencies, and (4) were more transient. 3. The strength of a neurone's receptive-field surround was assessed by comparing neuronal responses to gratings of optimal spatial frequency with responses to gratings of low spatial frequency. Using this approach, receptive-field surrounds were found to be equally strong on average for magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 4. Spatial summation, as measured by a null test, was linear for all magnocellular and parvocellular cells tested; that is, Y cells were not observed in either species. Finally, most magnocellular neurones showed a contrast gain control mechanism, although this was not seen for parvocellular neurones.";Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA;"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Reid, RC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;clay_reid@hms.harvard.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [P30 EY012196, EY06604, F32 EY006604, EY10115, EY12196, R01 EY010115] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;55;56;57;0;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-3751;1469-7793;;J PHYSIOL-LONDON;J.

Decades of experimental and modeling work in the sensory cortex have demonstrated that a perceptual decision pool is usually composed of tens to hundreds of neurons, the responses of which are significantly correlated not only with each other, but also with the behavioral choices of an animal. Few studies, however, have measured neural activity in the sensory thalamus of awake, behaving animals. Therefore, it remains unclear how many thalamic neurons are recruited and how the information from these neurons is pooled at subsequent cortical stages to form a perceptual decision. In a previous study we measured neural activity in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) contrast detection task, and found that single LGN neurons were significantly correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices, despite their relatively poor contrast sensitivity and a lack of overall interneuronal correlations. We have now computationally tested a number of specific hypotheses relating these measured LGN neural responses to the contrast detection behavior of the animals. We modeled the perceptual decisions with different numbers of neurons and using a variety of pooling/readout strategies, and found that the most successful model consisted of about 50-200 LGN neurons, with individual neurons weighted differentially according to their signal-to-noise ratios (quantified as d-primes). These results supported the hypothesis that in contrast detection the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple thalamic neurons, and that the response fluctuations in these neurons can influence contrast perception, with the more sensitive thalamic neurons likely to exert a greater influence.;"[Jiang, Yaoguang; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Purushothaman, Gopathy; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37240 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University";Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, PMB407935 RM U-3218 MRB 3,465 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [EY001778, EY025422, R21 EY019132, EY008126, HD15052]; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health from grants EY001778 (VAC), EY025422 (VAC), R21 EY019132 (VAC), core grants EY008126 and HD15052, and funds from the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University.;;70;3;3;0;7;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5110;;;FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT;Front.

Therefore, the ability to accurately predict the precise locations of brain regions of interest (ROI) and to retrieve those areas as quickly as possible following the brain harvest is critical for Subsequent analyses. One way to achieve this objective is the utilization of high-resolution MRI to guide the subsequent dissections. In the present study, individual MRI images of the brains of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques that had chronically self-administered ethanol were employed in Order to determine which blocks of dissected tissue contained specific ROIs. MRI-guided brain dissection of discrete brain regions was completely accurate in 100% of the cases. In comparison, approximately 60-70% accuracy was achieved in dissections that relied on external landmarks alone without the aid of MRI. These results clearly demonstrate that the accuracy of targeting specific brain areas can be improved with high-resolution MR imaging. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

These regions, referred to as IPS1-4, show similar functional responses to the mapping tasks used to define them, yet differing responses to tests of other posterior parietal cortex (PPC) functions such as short-term memory, eye movements and object viewing, suggesting that they may have distinct patterns of structural connectivity to other parts of the brain. The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mapping with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to describe white matter connections of visuotopic regions along the IPS, in 25 neurotypical young-adult participants. We found that posterior IPS more likely connects to retinotopically defined visual regions, and superior temporal gyrus, relative to anterior IPS. Anterior IPS regions 3 and 4 had higher connection probabilities to prefrontal regions, relative to posterior IPS. All four IPS regions showed inter-hemispheric connections to analogous regions in the opposite hemisphere, as well as consistent connections to the thalamus and regions of the striatum. Multivariate pattern classification at the group level reliably distinguished IPS regions from one another on the basis of connectivity patterns, especially for the most distal pairs of regions; occipital and prefrontal regions provided the most discriminating information. These findings advance our understanding of the structure of visuotopic IPS, with implications for functional differences between regions, and possible homologies between humans and macaques. Visuospatial functions dependent on the parietal cortex are frequently impaired in individuals with developmental disorders and those afflicted by cerebrovascular disease; the findings described here can be used as a basis for comparing connectivity differences in these populations.

Given this limitation, our approach is to construct the maximum noise entropy response function of the system, leading to a closed-form and minimally biased model consistent with a given set of constraints on the input/output moments; the result is equivalent to conditional random field models from machine learning. For systems with binary outputs, such as neurons encoding sensory stimuli, the maximum noise entropy models are logistic functions whose arguments depend on the constraints. A constraint on the average output turns the binary maximum noise entropy models into minimum mutual information models, allowing for the calculation of the information content of the constraints and an information theoretic characterization of the system's computations. We use this approach to analyze the nonlinear input/output functions in macaque retina and thalamus; although these systems have been previously shown to be responsive to two input dimensions, the functional form of the response function in this reduced space had not been unambiguously identified. A second order model based on the logistic function is found to be both necessary and sufficient to accurately describe the neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, accounting for an average of 93% of the mutual information with a small number of parameters. Thus, despite the fact that the stimulus is highly non-Gaussian, the vast majority of the information in the neural responses is related to first and second order correlations. Our results suggest a principled and unbiased way to model multidimensional computations and determine the statistics of the inputs that are being encoded in the outputs.";"[Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fitzgerald, Jeffrey D.; Sharpee, Tatyana O.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sincich, Lawrence C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Beckman Vis Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA";"Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Francisco";Fitzgerald, JD (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Computat Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;sharpee@salk.edu;Sharpee, Tatyana O/E-8663-2010;Sharpee, Tatyana/0000-0002-7483-5081;"NIH [EY019493]; NSF [IIS-0712852, PHY-0822283]; Searle Funds; Alfred P.

Calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity is densely distributed in cells and neuropil within PI, except for a distinct centromedially located gap. This calbindin-poor zone, termed the medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(M)), corresponds precisely to a region that contains elevated cytochrome oxidase activity and parvalbumin immunostaining. The PI(M) extends slightly above and behind the classically defined limit of the inferior pulvinar, the corticotectal tract. Regions of inferior pulvinar with intense immunostaining for calbindin-D28k were the posterior division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(P), medial to PI(M)) and the central division (PI(C), lateral to PI(M)). A newly recognized lateral region, PI(L), adjoins the lateral geniculate nucleus and stains more lightly for calbindin and parvalbumin immunoreactivity and for cytochrome oxidase. Staining patterns for calbindin, parvalbumin, and cytochrome oxidase in the pulvinar of rhesus monkeys closely resemble those shown in squirrel monkey inferior pulvinar, suggesting that a common organization exists in all primates. In order to examine cortical connection patterns of the histochemically defined compartments in the inferior pulvinar, injections of up to five neuroanatomical tracers (wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent retrograde tracers) were placed in the same cerebral hemisphere. Single injection sites were in the middle temporal area (MT), and several separate injections were placed in a strip corresponding to the rostral subdivision of the dorsolateral area (DLr). Injections that involved only DLr and not MT labeled principally the PI(C), and more sparsely PI(P) and PI(L). DLr connections occupied a ''shell'' region dorsal to PI(M) that extended from PI(C) into the lateral and medial divisions of the pulvinar, PL and PM. Injection sites that included MT or were largely restricted to MT produced dense label in PI(M) and moderate label in PI(C) and PI(L). The retinotopic organization within the inferior pulvinar was inferred from patterns of connections. Connections with cortex related most closely to central vision were found posteriorly in PI(M) and in adjacent portions of PI(C) as it wraps around the caudal pole of PI(M). Cortex related to more peripheral locations in the lower visual field connected with more rostral PI(M) and PI(C). Patterns of label within the portions of PL and PM that were immediately adjacent to PI(M) roughly paralleled those in PI(M) and PI(C). Thus, a distinct chemoarchitectonic subdivision of the inferior pulvinar, PI(M), is the major source of thalamic projections to MT in squirrel monkeys. Interestingly, the relative scarcity of calbindin immunostaining in PI(M) is characteristic of ''primary'' thalamic relay nuclei, such as the ventroposterior and lateral geniculate nuclei. Thus, the PI(M)-MT pathway may share certain physiological characteristics with primary sensory relays, such as those involving intracellular calcium buffering and, perhaps, rapid and secure impulse transmission.

These changes can be attributed to processes that are intrinsic to the cortex, or can be inherited from alterations occurring at stages of sensory processing that are antecedent to the primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual system, focal binocular retinal lesions initially silence an area of cortex that represents the region of retina destroyed, but over a period of months this area recovers visually driven activity. The retinotopic map in the recovered area is altered, shifting its representation to the portion of retina immediately surrounding the lesion. This effectively shrinks the representation of the lesioned area of retina, and expands the representation of the lesion surround. To determine the loci along the visual pathway at which the reorganization takes place, we compared the course of topographic alterations in the primary visual cortex and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats and monkeys, At a time when the cortical reorganization is complete, the silent area of LGN persists, indicating that changes in cortical topography are due to alterations that are intrinsic to the cortex. To explore the participation of thalamocortical afferents in the reorganization, we injected a series of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers into reorganized and surrounding cortex of each animal. Our results show that the thalamocortical arbors do not extend beyond their normal lateral territory and that this physical dimension is insufficient to account for the reorganization. We suggest that the long-range intrinsic horizontal connections are a likely source of visual input into the reorganized cortical area.;ROCKEFELLER UNIV, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA;Rockefeller University;;;;Darian-Smith, Corinna/0000-0002-4753-4574;;;;;76;255;255;0;6;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

However, a systematic neuropathological analysis of the hippocampal formation and the thalamus in these rats is lacking. It is also unclear if reelin, a protein consistently associated with schizophrenia and potentially involved in the mechanism of action of MAM, participates in the neuropathological effects of this compound. Therefore, a thorough assessment including cytoarchitectural and neuromorphometric measurements of eleven brain regions was conducted. Numbers of reelin positive cells and reelin expression and methylation levels were also studied. Principal Findings: Compared to untreated rats, MAM-exposed animals showed a reduction in the volume of entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus associated with decreased neuronal soma. The entorhinal cortex also showed laminar disorganization and neuronal clusters. Reelin methylation in the hippocampus was decreased whereas reelin positive neurons and reelin expression were unchanged. Conclusions: Our results indicate that E17-MAM exposure reproduces findings from the hippocampal formation and the mediodorsal thalamus of patients with schizophrenia while providing little support for reelin's involvement. Moreover, these results strongly suggest MAM-treated animals have a diminished neuropil, which likely arises from abnormal neurite formation; this supports a recently proposed pathophysiological hypothesis for schizophrenia.";"[Matricon, Julien; Bellon, Alfredo; Frieling, Helge; Kebir, Oussama; Le Pen, Gwenaelle; Jay, Therese M.; Krebs, Marie-Odile] Ctr Psychiat & Neurosci, INSERM, U894, Lab Physiopathol Malad Psychiat, Paris, France; [Beuvon, Frederic; Daumas-Duport, Catherine] Univ Paris 05, Fac Med Paris Descartes, Hop St Anne, Neuropathol Unit, Paris, France; [Frieling, Helge] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Socialpsychiat & Psychotherapy, D-3000 Hannover, Germany; [Beuvon, Frederic; Daumas-Duport, Catherine] Ctr Psychiat & Neurosci, INSERM, U894, Lab Plast Gliale & Tumeurs Cerebrales, Paris, France";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; GHU PARIS Psychiatrie Neurosciences; Hannover Medical School; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite";Matricon, J (corresponding author), Univ Auvergne, Lab Pharmacol Fondamentale & Clin, Fac Med, INSERM,UMR766, Clermont Ferrand, France.;"alfredo.bellon@inserm.fr; marie-odile.krebs@inserm.fr";"Krebs, Marie-Odile/O-2104-2017; Frieling, Helge/C-5299-2015; Jay, Therese M/G-2297-2015; LE PEN, Gwenaëlle/M-9974-2017";"Krebs, Marie-Odile/0000-0002-4715-9890; Frieling, Helge/0000-0001-5146-9720; Jay, Therese M/0000-0002-2468-1141; LE PEN, Gwenaëlle/0000-0002-5405-8094; Jay, Therese/0000-0003-3553-9236";"Action Thematique Concertee [ASE2128CSA]; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche [ANR-05-NEUR-031-03]; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale [SPF20080511940]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [74641]; American Psychiatric Association";"Action Thematique Concertee; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)); Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale(Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); American Psychiatric Association";"This work was supported by Action Thematique Concertee (ASE2128CSA to J.M.); Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR-05-NEUR-031-03 PAIN to J.M.); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (SPF20080511940 to A.

This unique connectivity suggests that the TRN plays a pivotal role in regulating information flow through the thalamus. Here, we analyzed the roles of TRN neurons in visually guided reaching movements. We first used retrograde transneuronal labeling with rabies virus, and showed that the rostro-dorsal sector of the TRN (TRNrd) projected disynaptically to the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). In other experiments, we recorded neurons from the TRNrd or PMv while monkeys performed a visuomotor task. We found that neurons in the TRNrd and PMv showed visual-, set-, and movement-related activity modulation. These results indicate that the TRNrd, as well as the PMv, is involved in the reception of visual signals and in the preparation and execution of reaching movements. The fraction of neurons that were non-selective for the location of visual signals or the direction of reaching movements was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. Furthermore, the fraction of neurons whose activity increased from the baseline was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. The timing of activity modulation of visualrelated and movement-related neurons was similar in TRNrd and PMv neurons. Overall, our data suggest that TRNrd neurons provide motor thalamic nuclei with inhibitory inputs that are predominantly devoid of spatial selectivity, and that these signals modulate how these nuclei engage in both sensory processing and motor output during visually guided reaching behavior.;"[Saga, Yosuke; Nakayama, Yoshihisa; Yamagata, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Masashi; Hoshi, Eiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Frontal Lobe Funct Project, Tokyo, Japan; [Saga, Yosuke; Tremblay, Leon] CNRS, UMR 5229, Ctr Neurosci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France; [Saga, Yosuke; Nakayama, Yoshihisa; Yamagata, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Masashi; Hoshi, Eiji] Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan; [Takada, Masahiko; Hoshi, Eiji] Japan Agcy Med Res & Dev, AMED CREST, Tokyo, Japan";"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Kyoto University";Saga, Y (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5229, Ctr Neurosci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France.;sagalesvins@gmail.com;"Tremblay, Leon/H-1559-2017; Yamagata, Tomoko/AAQ-9935-2021; Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015";"Tremblay, Leon/0000-0001-8370-6903; Yamagata, Tomoko/0000-0001-7783-1206; Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280; Nakayama, Yoshihisa/0000-0001-9730-3347";"AMED-CREST, AMED; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellow for Research Abroad; Global COE Program of Tamagawa University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16KT0193, 15H01434, 15H05879, 17H05565, 15K21731, 17H06030, 15H01431, 16H02454, 26290012, 16K17369, 15K14316, 16H01611, 15H05871] Funding Source: KAKEN";"AMED-CREST, AMED; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellow for Research Abroad; Global COE Program of Tamagawa University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";The authors thank T.

Connectivity patterns of these regions may inform on mechanisms of action for DBS of these targets. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography were performed in 13 nondepressed subjects to determine connectivity patterns of SCCwm and ALIC. Tract maps were generated for each target in each subject, and tract voxels were coded as being unique to either target or shared. Group level tract maps were generated by including only those voxels common to at least 10 of 13 (>75%) subjects. Results: The two targets have distinct patterns of connectivity with regions of overlap. The SCCwm showed consistent ipsilateral connections to the medial frontal cortex, the full extent of the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial temporal lobe, dorsal medial thalamus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and the dorsal brainstem. The ALIC seed, in contrast, demonstrated widespread projections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Common to both targets, albeit through distinct white matter bundles, were connections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, nucleus accumbens, dorsal thalamus, and hypothalamus. Conclusions: Connectivity patterns of these two DBS white matter targets suggest distinct neural networks with areas of overlap in regions implicated in depression and antidepressant response.;"[Gutman, David A.; Holtzheimer, Paul E.; Mayberg, Helen S.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Behrens, Timothy E.

In the primates, two of the three major subdivisions, the lateral and inferior pulvinar, are heavily interconnected with a significant proportion of the visual association cortex. However, while we now have a better understanding of the bidirectional connectivity of these pulvinar subdivisions, its functions remain somewhat of an enigma. Over the past few years, researchers have started to tackle this problem by addressing it from the angle of development and visual cortical lesions. In this review, we will draw together literature from the realms of studies in nonhuman primates and humans that have informed much of the current understanding. This literature has been responsible for changing many long-held opinions on the development of the visual cortex and how the pulvinar interacts dynamically with cortices during early life to ensure rapid development and functional capacity Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest involvement of the pulvinar following lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1) and geniculostriate pathway in early life which have far better functional outcomes than identical lesions obtained in adulthood. Shedding new light on the pulvinar and its role following lesions of the visual brain has implications for our understanding of visual brain disorders and the potential for recovery.;"[Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Morrone, Maria Concetta] Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy; [Morrone, Maria Concetta] IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy";"Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute; Monash University; University of Pisa; IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris";"Morrone, MC (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Translat Res New Technol Med & Surg, Pisa, Italy.;Morrone, MC (corresponding author), IRCCS Stella Maris Fdn, Pisa, Italy.";concetta@in.cnr.it;"Bourne, James/B-5265-2018; Morrone, Maria Concetta/C-6756-2014";"Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108; Morrone, Maria Concetta/0000-0002-1025-0316";"ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN [338866]; NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship [APP1077677]";"ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN; NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)";This work was supported by ERC-FP7 ECSPLAIN (grant no. 338866) to MM.

To date, only certain vocal learning species show this behaviour spontaneously. Prior research training macaques (vocal non-learners) to tap to an auditory or visual metronome found their movements to be largely reactive, not predictive. Does this reflect the lack of capacity for predictive synchronization in monkeys, or lack of motivation to exhibit this behaviour? To discriminate these possibilities, we trained monkeys to make synchronized eye movements to a visual metronome. We found that monkeys could generate predictive saccades synchronized to periodic visual stimuli when an immediate reward was given for every predictive movement. This behaviour generalized to novel tempi, and the monkeys could maintain the tempo internally. Furthermore, monkeys could flexibly switch from predictive to reactive saccades when a reward was given for each reactive response. In contrast, when humans were asked to make a sequence of reactive saccades to a visual metronome, they often unintentionally generated predictive movements. These results suggest that even vocal non-learners may have the capacity for predictive and tempo-flexible synchronization to a beat, but that only certain vocal learning species are intrinsically motivated to do it.;"[Takeya, Ryuji; Kameda, Masashi; Tanaka, Masaki] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan; [Patel, Aniruddh D.] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Patel, Aniruddh D.] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Azrieli Program Brain Mind & Consciousness, Toronto, ON, Canada";"Hokkaido University; Tufts University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)";"Takeya, R; Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.";"takeryu@med.hokudai.ac.jp; masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp";"Takeya, Ryuji/R-3090-2019; Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011";Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan; Takeda Science Foundation; Suhara Memorial Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25119005, 17H03539] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Suhara Memorial Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"The authors thank T.

Injections were placed in the major somatotopic divisions of M1 (the hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, and face representations) and in the caudal and rostral M1 subareas. In most cases, we injected several differentiable tracers into different parts of M1. Our results indicate that the strongest connections of M1 are with subdivisions of the ventral lateral thalamus (VL); other connections are mainly with intralaminar nuclei (the central lateral, paracentral, and center median nuclei) and the reticular nucleus. Most projections are reciprocal and topographically organized. M1 is strongly connected with the principal (VLp), medial (VLx), and anterior (VLa) subdivisions of the VL complex but has at most weak connections with the dorsal division (VLd). Each of the major somatotopic divisions of M1 is connected with an anteroposteriorly elongated territory within the VL complex. The connections are somatotopically organized such that the M1 hindlimb representation is connected with a band of cells in the lateral and anterior portions of the VL complex (spanning VLa and VLp), whereas the trunk, forelimb, and face representations are connected with successively more medially and posteriorly situated cell bands (spanning VLa, VLp, and VLx). There is some degree of overlap between the somatotopic territories within VL, although the absence of double-labeled cells in cases with injections of adjacent somatotopic divisions of M1 suggests that individual thalamic neurons project to single somatotopic regions. In addition to somatotopic differences, the connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of M1 differ to some extent. Caudal M1 is connected most strongly with VLp, a target of cerebellar projections, but it is also connected with VLa, which receives pallidal inputs. In complementary fashion, rostral M1 is most strongly connected with VLa, but it is also connected with VLp. VLx, a target of cerebellar projections, has significant connections with both caudal and rostral M1. These results indicate that all parts of M1 are influenced by both the cerebellum and globus pallidus in owl monkeys, as has been suggested in some recent studies of macaque monkeys.

Objective: We report the effects of fluoro-cromolyn derivatives on microglial cell toxicity and microglial clearance of A beta(42). Methods: Microglial cell toxicity for cromolyn derivatives were determined in naive BV2 microglial cells. Microglial clearance assays were performed with A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cell line and single cell clone BV2 line expressing CD33WT. PET imaging was performed for three F-18 analogs in a rhesus macaque. Results: All compounds but derivative 8 exhibited lowmicroglial cell toxicity. Cromolyn 1 and derivatives 2, 4, and 7 displayed an increased uptake on A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cells. Derivative 4 increased A beta(42) uptake in a dose-dependent manner and at 75 mu M resulted in a one-fold increase in A beta(42) uptake in BV2-CD33(WT). PET imaging for three [F-18]cromolyn analogs revealed the order of brain tracer penetration to be 4a > 10 > 2a. Tracer 4a exhibited enhanced uptake in areas of high perfusion (putamen, grey matter, and cerebellum) and lower signal in areas of lower perfusion (caudate, thalamus, and white matter). Conclusion: Substantial uptake of A beta(42) in both naive BV2 and BV2-CD33WT cells observed with 4 indicate conversion of microglial cells from a pro-inflammatory to an activation state favoring A beta phagocytosis/clearance. These findings suggest that a fluoro-cromolyn analog could reduce fibril-prone A beta 42 in vivo and thereby serve as a therapeutic for the treatment and prevention of AD.;"[Shoup, Timothy M.; Normandin, Marc D.; Dhaynaut, Maeva; Moon, Sung-Hyun; Guehl, Nicolas J.; Brugarolas, Pedro; Elmaleh, David R.; El Fakhri, Georges] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gordon Ctr Med Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Griciuc, Ana; Quinti, Luisa; Walsh, Lindsay, V; Tanzi, Rudolph E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, McCance Ctr Brain Hlth, Mass Gen Inst Neurodegenerat Dis, Dept Neurol,Genet & Aging Res Unit, Charlestown, MA USA; [Griciuc, Ana; Quinti, Luisa; Walsh, Lindsay, V; Tanzi, Rudolph E.] Harvard Med Sch, Charlestown, MA USA; [Elmaleh, David R.] AZTHERAPIES INC, Boston, MA USA";"Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";"Elmaleh, DR (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St,Edwards Res 015, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;El Fakhri, G (corresponding author), 125 Nashua St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.";"delmaleh@partners.org; elfakhri@pet.mgh.harvard.edu";"Normandin, Marc D/C-6728-2015; Moon, Sung-Hyun/HPE-8086-2023";"Normandin, Marc D/0000-0003-1645-523X; ";Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant [P41EB022544 TDR3];Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant;This study was funded by the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging NIH Grant: P41EB022544 TDR3.

A few electrophysiological studies in simian primates have investigated the functional organization of pulvinar by examining visuotopic maps. Multiple visuotopic maps have been found for all studied simians, with differences in organization reported between New and Old World simians. Given that prosimians are considered closer to the common ancestors of New and Old World primates, we investigated the visuotopic organization of pulvinar in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnettii). Single-electrode extracellular recording was used to find the retinotopic maps in the lateral (PL) and inferior (PI) pulvinar. Based on recordings across cases, a 3D model of the map was constructed. From sections stained for Nissl bodies, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or cytochrome oxidase, we identified three PI chemoarchitectonic subdivisions, lateral central (PIcl), medial central (PIcm), and medial (PIm) inferior pulvinar. Two major retinotopic maps were identified that cover PL and PIcl, the dorsal one in dorsal PL and the ventral one in PIcl and ventral PL. Both maps represent central vision at the posterior end of the border between the maps, the upper visual field in the lateral half and the lower visual field in the medial half. They share many features with the maps reported for the pulvinar of simians, including the location in pulvinar and the representation of the upper-lower and central-peripheral visual field axes. The second-order representation in the lateral map and a laminar organization are likely features specific to Old World simians. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3432-3450, 2013.

The complex in vitro profile of buprenorphine, with affinity for mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors (OR), makes it difficult to predict its dose-related neuropharmacology in vivo. In rats, microPET imaging and pretreatment by OR antagonists were performed to assess the binding of radiolabeled buprenorphine (microdose C-11-buprenorphine) to OR subtypes in vivo (n = 4 per condition). The mu-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg) and the non-selective OR antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) blocked the binding of C-11-buprenorphine, while pretreatment by the delta-selective (naltrindole, 3 mg/kg) or the kappa-selective antagonist (norbinaltorphimine, 10 mg/kg) did not. In four macaques, PET imaging and kinetic modeling enabled description of the regional brain kinetics of C-11-buprenorphine, co-injected with increasing doses of unlabeled buprenorphine. No saturation of the brain penetration of buprenorphine was observed for doses up to 0.11 mg/kg. Regional differences in buprenorphine-associated receptor occupancy were observed. Analgesic doses of buprenorphine (0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg), respectively, occupied 20% and 49% of receptors in the thalamus while saturating the low but significant binding observed in cerebellum and occipital cortex. Occupancy >90% was achieved in most brain regions with plasma concentrations >7 mu g/L. PET data obtained after co-injection of an analgesic dose of buprenorphine (0.003 mg/kg) predicted the binding potential of microdose C-11-buprenorphine. This strategy could be further combined with pharmacodynamic exploration or pharmacological MRI to investigate the neuropharmacokinetics and neuroreceptor correlate, at least at mu-OR, of the acute effects of buprenorphine in humans.;"[Auvity, Sylvain; Goutal, Sebastien; Caille, Fabien; Vodovar, Dominique; Wimberley, Catriona; Leroy, Claire; Tonietto, Matteo; Bottlaender, Michel; Tournier, Nicolas] Serv Hosp Frederic Joliot, JOLIOT, DRF, CEA, Orsay, France; [Auvity, Sylvain; Vodovar, Dominique] Univ Paris, UMR S 1144, Paris, France; [Goutal, Sebastien] Univ Paris Saclay, MIRCen, CEA, IBFJ,DRF JACOB,LMN,CNRS,UMR 9199, Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Caille, Fabien; Leroy, Claire; Tonietto, Matteo; Bottlaender, Michel; Tournier, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Imagerie Biomed Multimodale Paris Saclay, Inserm, CNRS,CEA,BioMaps, Orsay, France; [Pruvost, Alain] Univ Paris Saclay, Serv Pharmacol & Immunoanal SPI, Plateforme Smart MS, CEA,INRA, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Wimberley, Catriona] Univ Edinburgh, Queens Med Res Inst, Edinburgh Imaging, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland";"CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Edinburgh";"Tournier, N (corresponding author), Serv Hosp Frederic Joliot, JOLIOT, DRF, CEA, Orsay, France.;Tournier, N (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Imagerie Biomed Multimodale Paris Saclay, Inserm, CNRS,CEA,BioMaps, Orsay, France.";nicolas.tournier@universite-paris-saclay.fr;"VODOVAR, Dominique/ABP-5785-2022; Auvity, Sylvain/GXF-8125-2022; Vodovar, Dominique/AFR-7694-2022; Claire, LEROY/HZH-5593-2023; Tonietto, Matteo/Q-4644-2018";"VODOVAR, Dominique/0000-0002-8196-5511; Vodovar, Dominique/0000-0002-8196-5511; Tonietto, Matteo/0000-0001-9591-5710; Auvity, Sylvain/0000-0001-6208-6709";"IDEX Paris-Saclay [ANR-11-INBS-0006];  [ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02]";"IDEX Paris-Saclay; ";This work was performed on a platform member of France Life Imaging network (grant ANR-11-INBS-0006) and was funded by the Lidex-PIM project funded by the IDEX Paris-Saclay, ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02.

Combination of these techniques constitutes a novel approach for the collection and analysis of neuroanatomical data. Together, these techniques enable large-scale, and therefore more comprehensive, sampling of selective neuronal populations and establish unbiased quantitative methods for describing morphologically unique neuronal classes within a population. The protocol outlines the use of modified rabies virus to selectively label neurons. G-deleted rabies virus acts like a retrograde tracer following stereotaxic injection into a target brain structure of interest and serves as a vehicle for the delivery and expression of EGFP in neurons. Large numbers of neurons are infected using this technique and express GFP throughout their dendrites, producing Golgi-like complete fills of individual neurons. Accordingly, the virus-mediated retrograde tracing method improves upon traditional dye-based retrograde tracing techniques by producing complete intracellular fills. Individual well-isolated neurons spanning all regions of the brain area under study are selected for reconstruction in order to obtain a representative sample of neurons. The protocol outlines procedures to reconstruct cell bodies and complete dendritic arborization patterns of labeled neurons spanning multiple tissue sections. Morphological data, including positions of each neuron within the brain structure, are extracted for further analysis. Standard programming functions were utilized to perform independent cluster analyses and cluster evaluations based on morphological metrics. To verify the utility of these analyses, statistical evaluation of a cluster analysis performed on 160 neurons reconstructed in the thalamic reticular nucleus of the thalamus (TRN) of the macaque monkey was made. Both the original cluster analysis and the statistical evaluations performed here indicate that TRN neurons are separated into three subpopulations, each with unique morphological characteristics.;"[Bragg, Elise M.; Briggs, Farran] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA";Dartmouth College;Briggs, F (corresponding author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Physiol & Neurobiol, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Farran.Briggs@dartmouth.edu;;;"NIH [NEI: EY018683]; Whitehall Foundation";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitehall Foundation";We would like to thank Drs.

Three monkeys were trained to grasp an unseen instrumented object between the thumb and index finger and to lift and hold it stationary within a position window for 2-2.5 s. The grip and load forces and the object displacement were measured on each trial. Sin.-le-unit activity was recorded from the hand regions in the PMv and PMd. In some conditions a predictable perturbation was applied to the object after 1,500 ms of static holding, whereas in other conditions different random combinations of perturbed and unperturbed trials were given. In the perturbed conditions, some were randomly and intermittently presented with a warning flash, whereas some were unsignaled. The activities of 198 cells were modulated during the task performance. Of these cells, 151 were located in the PMv, and 47 were located in the PMd. Although both PMv and PMd neurons had similar discharge patterns, more PMd neurons (84 vs. 43%) showed early pregrip activity. Forty of 106 PMv and 10/30 PMd cells responded to the perturbation with reflexlike triggered reactions. The latency of this response was always <100 ms with a mean of about 55 ms in both the PMv and the PMd. In contrast, 106 PMv and 30 PMd cells tested with the perturbations, only 9 and 10%, respectively, showed significant but nonspecific adaptations to the perturbation. The warning stimulus did not increase the occurrence of specific responses to the perturbation even though 21 of 42 cells related to the grip task also responded to moving visual stimuli. The responses were retinal and frequently involved limited portions of both foveal and peripheral visual fields. When tested with a 75 x 5.5-cm dark bar on a light background, these cells were sensitive to the direction of movement. In summary, the periarcuate premotor area activity to related to predictable force-pulse perturbations seems to reflect a general increase in excitability in contrast to a more specific anticipatory activity such as recorded in the cerebellum. In spite of the strong cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections, the results of the present study suggest that the cortical premotor areas are not involved in the elaboration of adaptive internal models of hand-object dynamics.;Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sci Neurol, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3T8, Canada;Universite de Montreal;Smith, AM (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech Sci Neurol, Dept Physiol, CP 6128 Succ A, Montreal, PQ H3C 3T8, Canada.;;;;;;;;57;20;20;1;3;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

With the increased use of multielectrode recording techniques, synchronous firing of ensembles of neurons has been found at all levels in the mammalian visual pathway, from the retina to the extrastriate cortex. Here we distinguish three categories of synchrony in the visual system, (a) synchrony from anatomical divergence, (b) stimulus-dependent synchrony, and (c) emergent synchrony (oscillations). Although all three categories have been well documented, their functional significance remains uncertain. We discuss several lines of evidence both for and against a role for synchrony in visual processing: the perceptual consequences of synchronous activity, its ability to carry information, and the transmission of synchronous neural events to subsequent stages of processing.;Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA;"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Usrey, WM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Clay_Reid@hms.harvard.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY10115, F32 EY06604] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;139;249;252;0;17;ANNUAL REVIEWS;PALO ALTO;4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA;0066-4278;1545-1585;;ANNU REV PHYSIOL;Annu.

Recent anatomical and physiological studies, however, defined two areas in the medial part of Brodmann's area 6. The anterior part is now called the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the posterior part, the SMA proper or the SMA. Both areas have unique combinations of cortical and thalamocortical connectivity. Although neurons in both areas take some part in simple motor tasks such as pushing buttons in response to sensory signals, characteristic activity is found in the kind of motor tasks that require temporal organization. Temporal sequencing of multiple movements, for instance, requires a role of neuronal activity in both the SMA and pre-SMA.;;;Tanji, J (corresponding author), TOHOKU UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT PHYSIOL, AOBA KU, 2-1 SEIRYO CHO, SENDAI, MIYAGI 980, JAPAN.;;;;;;;;103;55;55;0;8;KARGER;BASEL;ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;0014-3022;1421-9913;;EUR NEUROL;Eur.

To understand these differences on the level of single neurons we compared neuronal firing in the primary and posterior auditory cortex of the two hemispheres and in the medial geniculate body in monkeys while subjects categorized pitch relationships in tone sequences. In contrast to earlier findings in imaging studies performed on humans, we found little difference between the three brain regions in terms of the category-specificity of their neuronal responses, of tonic firing related to task components, and of decision-related firing. The differences between the results in humans and monkeys may result from the type of neuronal activity considered and how it was analyzed, from the auditory cortical fields studied, or from fundamental differences between these species.;"[Selezneva, Elena; Brosch, Michael] Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Specal Lab Primate Neurobiol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Oshurkova, Elena; Scheich, Henning] Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Dept Auditory Learning & Speech, Magdeburg, Germany";"Leibniz Institut fur Neurobiologie (LIN); Leibniz Institut fur Neurobiologie (LIN)";Brosch, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Specal Lab Primate Neurobiol, Magdeburg, Germany.;Brosch@lin-magdeburg.de;Selezneva, Elena/GWU-7773-2022;"Selezneva, Elena/0000-0001-6623-6815; Brosch, Michael/0000-0003-3687-3754";"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB TR 31, He 1721/10-1, He 1721/10-2]; Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association";"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association";"This work was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB TR 31, He 1721/10-1, He 1721/10-2), and by intramural funding.

Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes >0.8 degrees. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes >1 degrees. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.;"[Liu, Xu; Li, Hui; Lei, Tianhao; Andolina, Ian Max; Wang, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci,Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Andolina, Ian Max; Wang, Wei] Shanghai Ctr Brain & Brain Inspired Intelligence, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xu; Wang, Wei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ye] Commun Univ China, Neurosci & Intelligent Media Inst, State Key Lab Media Convergence & Commun, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jijun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Mental Hlth Ctr, Shanghai Key Lab Psychot Disorders, Sch Med, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Spillmann, Lothar] Univ Freiburg, Dept Neurol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Communication University of China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Freiburg";"Andolina, IM; Wang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Inst Neurosci, State Key Lab Neurosci,Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Andolina, IM; Wang, W (corresponding author), Shanghai Ctr Brain & Brain Inspired Intelligence, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Wang, W (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.";"i.andolina@ion.ac.cn; w.wang@ion.ac.cn";"Andolina, Ian Max/S-7179-2019; Li, Hui/GXM-5002-2022";"Andolina, Ian Max/0000-0001-9985-3414; ";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB32060200]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant [2018SHZDZX05]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31861143032, 32070992]; Shanghai Science and Technology Commission [19411969100]";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Science and Technology Commission(Shanghai Science & Technology CommitteeScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM))";"This work was supported by Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Grant XDB32060200 (to W.W.); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project Grant 2018SHZDZX05 (to W.W. and I.M.A.); National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants 31861143032 to W.W.) and 32070992 (to I.M.A.); and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Project Grant 19411969100.";;127;3;3;1;10;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Areal and laminar origins were characterized as part of a larger study of thalamic input and cortical origins of projections to each area. Cholera toxin beta subunit (CT beta) and cholera toxin beta subunit gold-conjugate (CT beta G) were injected separately within an area or in different areas in an experiment. The areas were identified independently with SMI-32, which revealed differences in neurofilament immunoreactivity in layers III, V, and VI. Each area received convergent AC input from 3 to 6 (mean, 5) contralateral areas. Most of the projections (>75%) were homotopic and from topographically organized loci in the corresponding area. Heterotopic projections (>1 mm beyond the main homotopic projection) constituted approximate to 25% of the input. Layers III and V contained >95% of the commissural neurons. Commissural projection neurons were clustered in all areas. Commissural divergence, assessed by double labeling, was less than 3% in each area. This sparse axonal branching is consistent with the essentially homotopic connectivity of the commissural system. The many heterotopic origins represent unexpected commissural influences converging on an area. Areas more dorsal on the cortical convexity have commissural projections originating in layers III and V; more ventral areas favor layer III at the expense of layer V, to its near-total exclusion in some instances. Some areas have almost entirely layer III origins (temporal cortex and area All), whereas others have a predominantly layer V input (anterior auditory field) or dual contributions from layers III and V (the dorsal auditory zone). A topographic distribution of commissural cells of origin is consistent with the order observed in thalamocortical and corticocortical projections, and which characterizes all extrinsic projection systems (commissural, corticocortical, and thalamocortical) in all AC areas. Thus, laminar as well as areal differences in projection origin distinguish the auditory cortical commissural system.";"[Lee, Charles C.; Winer, Jeffery A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";"University of California System; University of California Berkeley";Lee, CC (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol, 947 E 58th St,MC0926, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;clee@bsd.uchicago.edu;Lee, Charles/AGY-0285-2022;Lee, Charles/0000-0001-6938-1604;NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC002319, R01 DC002319-27, R01 DC2319-29] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;81;50;51;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

To study optic radiations connectivity by means of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches, noninvasively, in vivo, in healthy human brains. METHODS. Sixteen healthy subjects (nine males, age range, 25-40 years) were included in this study. Morphologic and diffusion data were acquired by means of a 3T MRI scanner. Using an advanced tractographic technique, based on probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm, postprocessing analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Outcome measure was the percentage distribution of optic radiations streamlines in different cortical visual areas (V1-V5). The latter were detected by means of Juelich probabilistic histologic atlas. RESULTS. Average connectivity analyses revealed that the optic radiations are mainly distributed in V1 (47.46% +/- 5.5) and V2 (32.45% +/- 3.98); furthermore, direct connections with V3 (7.81 +/- 3.06), V4 (4.22% +/- 1.82), and V5 (8.06% +/- 2.65) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS. In the present study, the connectivity profile of optic radiations, obtained by means of algorithms not affected by the limitations of other tractographic techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, was shown in healthy human brains. Interestingly, direct connections with V4 were detected for the first time in humans; moreover, further support on the possible existence of V5 connections was provided. Our findings showed new connections between lateral geniculate nuclei and cortical visual areas, giving a further possible comprehension of the phenomena leading to the visual signals elaboration.";"[Arrigo, Alessandro; Mormina, Enricomaria; Gaeta, Michele; Anastasi, Giuseppe Pio; Aragona, Pasquale] Univ Messina, Dept Biomed Sci & Morphol & Funct Images, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy; [Calamuneri, Alessandro] Univ Messina, Dept Neurosci, Messina, Italy; [Quartarone, Angelo; Marino, Silvia] IRCCS Ctr Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo, Messina, Italy";"University of Messina; University of Messina; IRCCS Bonino Pulejo";Arrigo, A (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dept Biomed Sci & Morphol & Funct Images, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy.;alessandro.arrigo@hotmail.com;"Aragona, Pasquale/I-5286-2012; Mormina, Enricomaria/K-4664-2016; Calamuneri, Alessandro/K-8065-2016; Anastasi, Giuseppe/ABI-5282-2020; Marino, Silvia/T-5118-2019; QUARTARONE, Angelo/G-3264-2017";"Aragona, Pasquale/0000-0002-9582-9799; Mormina, Enricomaria/0000-0003-2716-5772; Calamuneri, Alessandro/0000-0003-3164-6464; Marino, Silvia/0000-0002-1088-6808; QUARTARONE, Angelo/0000-0003-1485-6590";;;;;48;14;14;0;2;ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC;ROCKVILLE;12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA;0146-0404;1552-5783;;INVEST OPHTH VIS SCI;Invest.

This antibody preferentially stains LGN cells that display the morphological characteristics of Y-cells. The soma sizes of SMI-32-stained cells were consistent with those of the overall population of Y-cells, and the Golgi-like staining of their dendrites revealed a radial distribution that often crossed laminar boundaries. Labeled cells were distributed within the A laminae (primarily near laminar borders), the magnocellular portion of the C laminae, and the medial intralaminar nucleus, but they were absent in the parvocellular C laminae. Electron microscopic examination of SMl-32-stained tissue revealed that staining was confined to somata, dendrites, and large myelinated axons. Retinal synapses on SMI-32-labeled dendrites were primarily simple axodendritic contacts; few triadic arrangements were observed. In the LGN of cats reared with monocular lid suture, SMI-32, staining was decreased significantly in the A laminae that received input from the deprived eye. Dephosphorylation of the tissue did not alter the cellular SMI-32 staining patterns. Analysis of staining patterns in the G laminae and monocular zone of the A laminae suggests that changes in the cytoskeleton after lid suture reflect cell class and not binocular competition.

The neurons studied lay within either the alpha or the beta division of lamina 4C; previous workers have shown the alpha division neurons to be contacted by thalamic axon terminals arising from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and the beta division neurons to be contacted by parvocellular LGN inputs. Most thalamic terminals and perhaps the majority of other type 1 (Colonnier, '81), presumed excitatory, inputs to these cells make synaptic contacts on the tips of their dendritic spines. Measurement was made of relative changes in the total number of spines on these alpha and beta spiny neurons over age by measuring both spine density along the dendrites and dendritic arbor size in single 90-mu-m sections from Golgi rapid preparations. Our previous work (Lund et al., '77; Boothe et al., '79) showed a marked proliferation and attrition of spines and dendritic branches to occur in the early postnatal weeks; Rakic et al. ('86) have since proposed that there is a cortexwide synchrony of synapse acquisition and loss during this same period. However, different visual capacities channelled via the magnocellular and parvicellular geniculate relays show different maturational rates (Harwerth et al., '86). This study indicates that the anatomical maturation of spines on the alpha and beta neurons is not temporally coincident from birth to 30 weeks. During this period, phases of spine acquisition and loss on alpha neurons precedes similar phases on beta neurons. The alpha neurons carry a peak spine population at 5-8 weeks postnatal, whereas the beta neurons carry their peak spine populations between 8 and 24 weeks postnatal. At all ages prior to 30 weeks, the two sets of neurons carry quite different total spine populations. Close to 30 weeks of age, the total spine coverage has fallen on both sets of neurons and becomes identical between the alpha and beta neurons. In animals aged 30 weeks to adult, spine coverage per neuron is maintained at a common figure for the alpha and beta neurons despite further growth and disparate dendritic arbor sizes and different local spine densities in the two groups; this suggests that some common sampling paradigm between pre- and postsynaptic elements is adopted by the alpha and beta neurons and also suggests the development of a close functional correlation between the two sets of neurons.";UNIV PITTSBURGH,CTR NEUROSCI,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261;"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";LUND, JS (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PSYCHIAT,336C SCAIFE HALL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY01086, EY05282] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;42;51;51;0;0;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that testosterone increases neural activity in the amygdala. To investigate whether this could be due to altered regulation of amygdala functioning which is thought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, we studied the effects of exogenous testosterone on the interaction between the amygdala and other brain regions. Healthy middle-aged women received a single nasal testosterone dose in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover manner, and performed an emotional face matching task while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI. The results show that testosterone rapidly reduced functional coupling of the amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex, and enhanced amygdala coupling with the thalamus. This suggests that testosterone may reduce the regulatory control over the amygdala, or that testosterone shifts amygdala output away from the orbitofrontal cortex towards the thalamus. Testosterone also reduced functional coupling with the contralateral amygdala. Because interhemispheric amygdala coupling is lower in men than in women, this result suggests that circulating testosterone may contribute to this sexual dimorphism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the pulvinar nucleus upon response properties of single cells in the second visual area (V2) of Cebus monkeys. The method used consisted of the inactivation of a portion of the lateral pulvinar by GABA injections while studying the response properties of cells in V2 at the same visuotopic location as that of the inactivation. 2. After GABA injection in the pulvinar, most cells in V2 (67%) showed changes in spontaneous and/or stimulus-driven activities. Contrary to the effect found with inactivation of the striate cortex, which promotes a reduction in the response of V2 neurons, we found that the main effect of pulvinar inactivation was an increment in stimulus-driven responses of V2 cells (39% of units studied). A reduction of responses was observed in 27% of units. 3. A change in orientation and/or direction selectivity was found in 91% of cells after inactivation of the pulvinar. Most commonly, the orientation selectivity of a neuron was decreased during pulvinar inactivation. 4. The inactivation results indicate that the pulvinar projections have a modulatory effect on the activity of V2 cells.;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Programa Neurobiol, Lab Fisiol Cognicao,CCS, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro;Gattass, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biofis Carlos Chagas Filho, Programa Neurobiol, Lab Fisiol Cognicao,CCS, Bloco G, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;rgattass@biof.ufrj.br;Soares, Juliana Guimarães Martins/A-7124-2013;Soares, Juliana Guimarães Martins/0000-0002-0408-8607;;;;;40;22;23;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1440-1681;;;CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P;Clin.

The first class of responses have larger initial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), exhibit paired-pulse depression, are limited to ionotropic glutamate receptor activation, and have larger synaptic terminals; the second has smaller initial EPSPs, paired-pulse facilitation, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, and smaller synaptic terminals.

These cortical subpopulations display different axonal outgrowth kinetics and innervate distinct thalamic nuclei in a temporal pattern determined by cortical layer identity and subclass specificity. Guidance by molecular cues, structural cues, and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to this development. There is a substantial rearrangement of the corticofugal connectivity outside the thalamus at the border of and within the reticular thalamic nucleus, a region that shares some of the characteristics of the cortical subplate during development. The early transient circuits are not well understood, nor the extent to which this developmental pattern may be driven by peripheral sensory activity.

We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53%) and/or auditory beep (61%) or click (91%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.";"Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan; Osaka Univ, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";"Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine; Osaka University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)";Kimura, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.;mkimura@basic.kpu-m.ac.jp;"Minamimoto, Takafumi/AAD-8726-2020; Minamimoto, Takafumi/D-6610-2012";"Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Graybiel, Ann/0000-0002-4326-7720";NINDS NIH HHS [NS-25529] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;85;335;342;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.;"[Mayer, Andrei] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ciencias Fisiol, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ S-N, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Lewenfus, Gabriela; da Franca, Joao Guedes] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biophys Carlos Chagas Filho, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Bittencourt-Navarrete, Ruben Ernesto] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Physiol, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, Brazil; [Clasca, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain";"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Autonomous University of Madrid";"Mayer, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ciencias Fisiol, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ S-N, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;da Franca, JG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biophys Carlos Chagas Filho, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.";"andreimayer87@gmail.com; jgfranca@biof.ufrj.br";Cabré, Francisco Clasca/AAR-9907-2021;Cabré, Francisco Clasca/0000-0003-0718-1337;"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ; CNPq (Programa de Ciencia sem Fronteiras-Programa Pesquisador Visitante Especial) (PVE 2014) [024.028/2017, 400730/2014-6]";"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); CNPq (Programa de Ciencia sem Fronteiras-Programa Pesquisador Visitante Especial) (PVE 2014)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF))";Grants from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil and Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ.

This study examined the physiological characteristics of incertal neurons and their relationship to saccades. Cells in the zona incerta have moderate rates of activity and pause during saccades. These pauses begin prior to the start of saccades and activity resumes after the end of saccades in all directions and for all amplitudes. This perisaccadic pause is positively correlated with the duration of the saccade such that the longer the saccade is, the longer a pause is observed. These physiological data, in conjunction with anatomical observations, suggest that the zona incerta might normally function by inhibiting the superior colliculus and then by disinhibiting the superior colliculus for saccades.;;;Ma, TP (corresponding author), UNIV MISSISSIPPI,MED CTR,DEPT ANAT,2500 N STATE ST,JACKSON,MS 39216, USA.;;;Ma, Terence/0000-0001-8488-113X;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR05386] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS32924] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;25;42;42;0;1;RAPID SCIENCE PUBLISHERS;LONDON;2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8NH;0959-4965;;;NEUROREPORT;Neuroreport;Nov 04;1996;7;15-17;;;;;2713;2716;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001756-199611040-00061;;;4;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;WB711;8981453;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1996WB71100061;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, we investigated how ongoing and visually driven activity in magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P) and koniocellular (K) layers of the LGN are related to cortical state. We recorded extracellular spiking activity in the LGN simultaneously with local field potentials (LFP) in primary visual cortex, in sufentanil-anaesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that asynchronous cortical states (marked by low power in delta-band LFPs) are linked to high spike rates in K cells (but not P cells or M cells), on multisecond timescales. Cortical asynchrony precedes the increases in K cell spike rates by 1-3s, implying causality. At subsecond timescales, the spiking activity in many cells of all (M, P and K) classes is phase-locked to delta waves in the cortical LFP, and more cells are phase-locked during synchronous cortical states than during asynchronous cortical states. The switch from low-to-high spike rates in K cells does not degrade their visual signalling capacity. By contrast, during asynchronous cortical states, the fidelity of visual signals transmitted by K cells is improved, probably because K cell responses become less rectified. Overall, the data show that slow fluctuations in cortical state are selectively linked to K pathway spiking activity, whereas delta-frequency cortical oscillations entrain spiking activity throughout the entire LGN, in anaesthetized marmosets.;"[Pietersen, Alexander N.

They have a large visual pulvinar complex, but its organization and relation to visual cortex is only partly known. We processed brain sections through the pulvinar with seven different procedures in an effort to reveal histologically distinct compartments. The results revealed three major subdivisions. A dorsal subdivision, Pc, stains darkly for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and occupies the dorsoposterior one-third of the pulvinar complex. A ventral subdivision, Pv, stains darkly when processed with the Cat-301 antibody and occupies the ventroanterior fifth of the pulvinar complex along the brachium of the superior colliculus. Unexpectedly, part of Pv is ventral to the brachium. A large central subdivision, Pc, stains moderately dark for AChE and cytochrome oxidase (CO), and very light for Cat-301. Pc includes about half of the pulvinar complex, with parts on both sides of the brachium of the superior colliculus. These architectonic results demonstrate that the pulvinar complex of tree shrews is larger and has more subdivisions than previously described. The complex resembles the pulvinar of primates by having a portion ventral to the brachium and by having histochemically distinct nuclei; the number of nuclei is less than in primates, however.

Results were compared with expression patterns in adults. In the sensorimotor cortex at E125, overall levels of all subunit transcripts were low. At E137, there was a major lamina-specific increase in all subunit messenger RNAs except gamma(1). For alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(4), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(1) subunit transcripts, this increase was highest in areas 3a and 3b, particularly in layers III/IV and VI. Postnatally, there were significant decreases in all transcripts. alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) subunit transcripts, while still at significantly lower levels than at E137, remained expressed at levels higher than other transcripts. Unlike in rodents, there was no obvious switch in the major subunits expressed in fetal and adult cortex, alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) remaining highest throughout. In area 17, the most prominently expressed subunits at earliest ages were alpha(2), alpha(5), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(2), especially in layers II/III and VI. At E150, expression for alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(1) and beta(3) subunit transcripts in these layers decreased, but levels for alpha(1), alpha(4), alpha(5), beta(2), gamma(1) and gamma(2) transcripts increased, particularly within layer IV. The increase at E150 was particularly marked for alpha(5) transcripts, which were expressed at levels more than four times those of other transcripts. alpha(1), beta(2) and gamma(2) remain highest into aduthood. Fetal area 17 displayed lamina-specific patterns of expression not found in adult animals. In particular, alpha(3) messenger RNAs were present in layer IVA and gamma(1) transcripts were present in layer IVC at E150, despite a lack of expression in these layers in the adult. These data demonstrate increased expression of GABA(A) receptors during the period of establishment of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, and a temporal regulation that may be associated with the period of developmental plasticity.

The characteristic organization of this nucleus in primates, as well as its apparent phylogenetic stability, have led to the proposal that the distinct laminar arrangement of the dLGN is one of the diagnostic characters that define the Order Primates. Here, we describe the distribution of retinal afferents to the dLGN of Tarsius, the single contemporary member of an ancient lineage of primates. In this genus, the more superficial layer of the dLGN receives projections from the ipsilateral eye, a unique situation among the members of the Order Primates. This observation adds support to the proposal that Tarsius does not share a more recent common ancestry with simians as compared with lemuriform and lorisiform primates.;INSERM,U371,F-69500 BRON,FRANCE;Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm);Rosa, MGP (corresponding author), UNIV QUEENSLAND,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,VIS TOUCH & HEARING RES CTR,ST LUCIA,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA.;;"COOPER, HOWARD M/M-7304-2014; Rosa, Marcello G/D-9278-2013";Rosa, Marcello G/0000-0002-6620-6285;;;;;54;18;19;0;2;KARGER;BASEL;ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;0006-8977;;;BRAIN BEHAV EVOLUT;Brain Behav.

A second visual pathway has been postulated to pass through the thalamic pulvinar nucleus and to project to multiple regions of visual cortex. We have explored this second visual pathway using a method that allows us to identify the inputs and outputs of pulvinar neurons. Specifically, we applied microstimulation in the superficial layers of superior colliculus (SC) to test for orthodromic activation of pulvinar neurons receiving input from SC. We also microstimulated the cortical motion area MT and tested for antidromic activation of pulvinar to identify neurons projecting to MT (and to determine the presence of orthodromic input back to pulvinar). In this initial report, we concentrate on two observations. First, we find that there are clusters of neurons in the pulvinar that receive input from SC along with neurons that project to MT or receive input from MT. Second, we find that neurons with input from SC have characteristics of the SC superficial layers: they respond to visual stimuli but do not discharge before saccadic eye movements. Neurons projecting to MT respond similarly to these SC-input neurons, while those receiving input from MT more frequently show directional selectivity as does MT. These findings indicate the visual nature of the signals conveyed in this pathway and shed light on the functional role of the thalamus in a possible second visual pathway.;"[Berman, Rebecca A.; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Berman, RA (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;bermanr@nei.nih.gov;;;Intramural NIH HHS [Z01 EY000109-28] Funding Source: Medline;Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);;;18;48;48;0;6;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;978-0-444-53163-6;PROG BRAIN RES;Prog.

The results indicated that ventral precallosal and subcallosal areas 14 and 25, and the ventral, subcallosal parr of area 32, all receive projections from the mediodorsal portion of the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDmc). The dorsal, precallosal part of area 32 receives projections mainly from the dorsal portion of the parvocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDpc), which also provides some input to area 14. Polar area 10 receives input from both MDpc and the densocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDdc), as does supracallosal area 24. Area 24 receives additional input from the anterior medial nucleus and midline nuclei. All medial prefrontal cortical areas were also found to receive projections from a number of cortical regions within the temporal lobe, such as the temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Areas 24, 25, and 32 receive, in addition, input from the entorhinal cortex. Combining these results with prior anatomical and behavioral data, we conclude that medial temporal areas that are important for object recognition memory send information directly both to dorsal medial prefrontal areas 24 and 32 and to ventral medial prefrontal areas 14 and 25.

Deer mice were reared under either enriched or standard housing conditions for 60 days following weaning. All mice were then placed in automated photocell detectors and classified as either stereotypic or non-stereotypic. Neuronal metabolic activity was then assessed using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. The results demonstrated that environmental enrichment significantly increased neuronal metabolic activity in the motor cortex. Furthermore, non-stereotypic mice exhibited significantly more CO activity than stereotypic mice in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. This latter effect was due to the enriched mice as evidenced by a significant interaction between housing condition and behavioral status in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hippocampus. Thus, the observed increase in CO activity reflected increased neuronal metabolic activity in non-stereotypic enriched mice relative to stereotypic enriched mice. These results suggest that, in a developmental model of spontaneous stereotypy, the enrichment-related prevention of stereotyped behavior is associated with increased CO activity.

These effects are thought to be due to facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical connections. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the spatial spread of responses to visual stimulation in human early visual cortex. The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil was administered to normal healthy human subjects to increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil decreased the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in visual cortex, consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive field size of cortical neurons. Donepezil also reduced response amplitude in visual cortex, but the cholinergic effects on spatial spread were not a direct result of reduced amplitude.

The issue of non-stereotyped projections at the columnar level is further considered by analysis of V1 axons terminating in primate area MT/V5 (an early visual area), and of an axon from temporal cortex terminating in area 7b (a higher cortical area). Both these axons have multiple non-uniform arbors. The implication is that each arbor recruits different numbers and possibly different combinations of postsynaptic elements. While more data are needed concerning convergence of connectional systems, and the actual identity and numbers of postsynaptic targets, the distributed spatial and laminar patterns do not evoke a repetitive uniformity, but rather a columnar substructure and the combinatoric possibilities of the 3-dimensional cortical organization.;RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan;RIKEN;Rockland, KS (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;rockland@brain.riken.go.jp;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;35;22;23;0;1;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0300-4864;;;J NEUROCYTOL;J.

Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure responses in the human LGN and SC during sustained spatial attention. Subjects covertly and continuously tracked one of two segments that rotated through the visual field, composed of either moving dots or transient colored shapes. Activity in both nuclei was generally enhanced by attention, independent of the stimulus type, with the voxels responding more sensitively to stimulus contrast ( those dominated by magnocellular input) exhibiting greater attentional enhancement. The LGN contained clusters of voxels exhibiting attentional enhancement or weak suppression, whereas the SC exhibited predominantly attentional enhancement, which was significantly stronger than in the LGN. The spatial distribution of the attentional effects was unrelated to the retinotopic organization in either structure. The results demonstrate that each of the major subcortical visual pathways participates in attentional selection, and their differential magnitudes of modulation suggest distinct roles.;"[Schneider, Keith A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Study Brain Mind & Behav, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Rochester Ctr Brain Imaging, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Schneider, Keith A.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Rochester; University of Rochester";Schneider, KA (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, 210 McAlester Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.;schneiderkei@missouri.edu;;"Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X; Schneider, Keith/0000-0001-7120-3380";"National Institutes of Health [2R01 MH64043, 1R01 EY017699, 2P50 MH62196, T32 MH065214]; National Science Foundation [BCS-0633281.]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants 2R01 MH64043, 1R01 EY017699, 2P50 MH62196, and T32 MH065214, and National Science Foundation Grant BCS-0633281.;;45;86;86;1;9;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Despite numerous investigations, the role of this feedback circuit in visual perception remained elusive. To probe the function of CG feedback in a causal manner, we selectively and reversibly manipulated the activity of CG neurons in anesthetized ferrets in vivo using a combined viral-infection and optogenetics approach to drive expression of channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in CG neurons. We observed significant increases in temporal precision and spatial resolution of LGN neuronal responses to drifting grating and white noise stimuli when CG neurons expressing ChR2 were light activated. Enhancing CG feedback reduced visually evoked response latencies, increased spike-timing precision, and reduced classical receptive field size. Increased precision among LGN neurons led to increased spike-timing precision among granular layer V1 neurons as well. Together, our findings suggest that the function of CG feedback is to control the timing and precision of thalamic responses to incoming visual signals.;"[Hasse, J.

Temporal and spectral features of click trains are differentially encoded in A1. Encoding of temporal features occurs at rates of 100-200 Hz through phase-locked activity in the MUA and CSD, is independent of pulse polarity pattern, and occurs in high best frequency (BF) regions of A1. The upper limit of ensemble-wide phase-locking is about 400 Hz in the input to A1, as manifested in the cortical middle laminae CSD and MUA of thalamocortical fibers. In contrast, encoding of spectral features occurs in low BF regions, and resolves both the f(0) and harmonics of the stimuli through local maxima of activity determined by the tonotopic organization of the recording sites. High-pass filtered click trains decrease spectral encoding in low BF regions without modifying phase-locked responses in high BF regions. These physiological responses parallel features of human pitch perception for click trains, and support the existence of two distinct physiological mechanisms involved in pitch perception: the first using resolved harmonic components and the second utilizing unresolved harmonics that is based on encoding stimulus waveform periodicity.

Strong local projections from the NOT were demonstrated to the superior colliculus and the dorsal terminal nucleus bilaterally and to the contralateral NOT. The contralateral oculomotor complex, including motoneurons (C-group) and subdivisions of the Edinger-Westphal complex, also received inputs. NOT efferents terminated in all accessory optic nuclei (AON) ipsilaterally; contralateral AON projections arose from the pretectal olivary nucleus embedded in the NOT. Descending pathways contacted precerebellar nuclei: the dorsolateral and dorsomedial pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and the inferior olive. Direct projections from NOT to the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (ppH) appeared to be weak, but retrograde tracer injections into rostral ppH verified this projection; furthermore, the injections demonstrated that AON efferents also enter this area. Efferents from the NOT also targeted ascending reticular networks from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the locus coeruleus. Rostrally, NOT projections included the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (Ign); the pregeniculate, peripeduncular, and thalamic reticular nuclei; and the pulvinar, the zona incerta, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the hypothalamus. The NOT could generate optokinetic nystagmus through projections to the AON, the ppH, and the precerebellar nuclei. However, NOT also projects to structures controlling saccades, ocular pursuit, the near response, Ign motion sensitivity, visual attention, vigilance, and gain modification of the vestibule-ocular reflex. Any hypothesis on the function of NOT must take into account its connectivity to all of these visuomotor structures.

Here we investigate whether the functional organization of the voluntary motor system differs between PD patients with and without resting tremor, and whether these differences relate to the cerebral circuit producing tremor. We compared 18 PD patients with marked tremor, 20 PD patients without tremor, and 19 healthy controls. Subjects performed a controlled motor imagery task during fMRI scanning. We quantified imagery-related cerebral activity by contrasting imagery of biomechanically difficult and easy movements. Tremor-related activity was identified by relating cerebral activity to fluctuations in tremor amplitude, using electromyography during scanning. PD patients with tremor had better behavioral performance than PD patients without tremor. Furthermore, tremulous PD patients showed increased imagery-related activity in somatosensory area 3a, as compared with both healthy controls and to nontremor PD patients. This effect was independent from tremor-related activity, which was localized to the motor cortex, cerebellum, and thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). The VIM, with known projections to area 3a, was unique in showing both tremor- and imagery-related responses. We conclude that parkinsonian tremor influences motor imagery by modulating central somatosensory processing through the VIM. This mechanism may explain clinical differences between PD patients with and without tremor. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

We here show that latexin-expressing neurons exhibit ultrastructural features common to cortical pyramidal neurons. We show in combined retrograde tracing and immunofluorescent experiments that latexin-expressing neurons contribute to specific cortico-cortical pathways. Thus, injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold into either the primary somatosensory (SI) or the primary motor (MI) cortical area labeled many latexin expressing neurons in the infragranular layers of the secondary somatosensory (SII) and visceral sensory (Vi) areas. In contrast, tracer injections involving the thalamus, striatum, or contralateral SII and Vi exclusively labeled latexin-nonexpressing neurons in both the SII and Vi. Finally, we show that the correct corticocortical projections can be formed in organotypic slice cultures in vitro from latexin-expressing neurons: when slices of developing SII were cocultured with those from the SI and the thalamus, latexin-immunoreactive neurons in the SII projected preferentially to their normal SI target. The specific connectivity formed in vivo and in vitro by this molecularly distinct neuronal population reveals its characteristic manner of cortical organization and provides a unique model system to analyze mechanisms underlying the formation of precise corticocortical pathways.;Mitsubishi Kasei Inst Life Sci, Machida, Tokyo 1948511, Japan;;Arimatsu, Y (corresponding author), Mitsubishi Kasei Inst Life Sci, 11 Minamiooya, Machida, Tokyo 1948511, Japan.;;;;;;;;53;39;39;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

However, its functional role in the higher visual cortex remains unclear. Here, we observed visual cortical area activity in anesthetized mice to evaluate the role of the extrageniculate pathway on their specialized visual properties. Results: The preferred stimulus velocities of neurons in the higher visual areas (lateromedial [LM], anterolateral [AL], anteromedial [AM], and rostrolateral [RL] areas) were measured using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging and two-photon calcium imaging and were higher than those in the primary visual cortex (V1). Further, the velocity-tuning properties of the higher visual areas were different from each other. The response activities in these areas decreased after V1 ablation; however, the visual properties' differences were preserved. After SC destruction, these preferences for high velocities disappeared, and their tuning profiles became similar to that of the V1, whereas the tuning profile of the V1 remained relatively normal. Neural tracer experiments revealed that each of these higher visual areas connected with specific subregions of the LPN. Conclusions: The preservation of visual property differences among the higher visual areas following V1 lesions and their loss following SC lesions indicate that pathways from the SC through the thalamus to higher cortical areas are sufficient to support these differences.";"[Tohmi, Manavu; Tsukano, Hiroaki; Hishida, Ryuichi; Shibuki, Katsuei] Niigata Univ, Dept Neurophysiol, Brain Res Inst, Chuo Ku, Niigata 9518585, Japan; [Meguro, Reiko] Niigata Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Chuo Ku, Niigata 9518510, Japan";"Niigata University; Niigata University";Tohmi, M (corresponding author), Niigata Univ, Dept Neurophysiol, Brain Res Inst, Chuo Ku, 1-757 Asahi Machi, Niigata 9518585, Japan.;tomi@bri.niigata-u.ac.jp;Tsukano, Hiroaki/G-5053-2013;Tsukano, Hiroaki/0000-0001-8511-7256;"Japanese Government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23500383] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japanese Government; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from the Japanese Government.

However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets, compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse. Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas (https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain. riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular organization for primate brain research.

Unfortunately, dMRI fiber mapping is an indirect method that relies on inference from measured diffusion patterns. Comparing dMRI results with other modalities is a way to improve the interpretation of dMRI data and help advance dMRI technologies. Here, we present methods for comparing dMRI fiber orientation estimates with optical imaging of fluorescently labeled neurofilaments and vasculature in 3D human and primate brain tissue cuboids cleared using CLARITY. The recent advancements in tissue clearing provide a new opportunity to histologically map fibers projecting in 3D, which represents a captivating complement to dMRI measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the capability to directly compare dMRI and CLARITY in the same human brain tissue and assess multiple approaches for extracting fiber orientation estimates from CLARITY data. We estimate the three-dimensional neuronal fiber and vasculature orientations from neurofilament and vasculature stained CLARITY images by calculating the tertiary eigenvector of structure tensors. We then extend CLARITY orientation estimates to an orientation distribution function (ODF) formalism by summing multiple sub-voxel structure tensor orientation estimates. In a sample containing part of the human thalamus, there is a mean angular difference of 19 degrees +/- 15 degrees between the primary eigenvectors of the dMRI tensors and the tertiary eigenvectors from the CLARITY neurofilament stain. We also demonstrate evidence that vascular compartments do not affect the dMRI orientation estimates by showing an apparent lack of correspondence (mean angular difference = 49 degrees +/- 23 degrees) between the orientation of the dMRI tensors and the structure tensors in the vasculature stained CLARITY images. In a macaque brain dataset, we examine how the CLARITY feature extraction depends on the chosen feature extraction parameters. By varying the volume of tissue over which the structure tensor estimates are derived, we show that orientation estimates are noisier with more spurious ODF peaks for sub-voxels below 30 mu m(3) and that, for our data, the optimal gray matter sub-voxel size is between 62.5 mu m(3) and 125 mu m(3). The example experiments presented here represent an important advancement towards robust multi-modal MRI-CLARITY comparisons.;"[Leuze, C.; Goubran, M.; Barakovic, M.; Tian, Q.; Weber, E. M.

Discharge patterns of neurons are regulated by synaptic inputs and by intrinsic membrane properties such as their complement of ionic conductances. Discharge patterns evoked by synaptic inputs are often used to identify the source and modality of sensory input. However, the interpretation of these discharge patterns may be complicated if different neurons respond to the same synaptic input with a variety of discharge patterns due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties. The purposes of this study were 1) to investigate intrinsic discharge patterns of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of raccoon in vivo and 2) to use somatosensory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of forepaw digits to determine thalamocortical connectivity for the same neurons. 2. Conventional intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes were made from 121 neurons in the cortical representation of glabrous skin of digit four (d4). Intracellular injection of identical current pulses (100-120 ms in duration) elicited various patterns of discharge in different neurons. Neurons were classified on the basis of these intrinsic patterns of discharge, rates of spike adaptation, and characteristics of spike waveforms. Three main groups were identified: regular spiking (RS) neurons, intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons, and fast spiking (FS) neurons. Subclasses were identified for the RS and IB groups. 3. Neurons were tested for somatosensory inputs by stimulating electrically d3, d4, and d5. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited in 100% of the neurons by electrical stimulation of d4, the ''on-focus'' digit. EPSPs were usually followed by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Many neurons (41%) responded with EPSP-IPSP sequences after stimulation of d3 or d5, the ''off-focus'' digits. 4. Latencies of somatosensory EPSPs and IPSPs were used to determine the synaptic order in the cortical circuitry of RS, IB, and FS neurons. EPSPs with monosynaptic thalamocortical latencies were recorded in RS, IB, and FS neurons. 5. We conclude that precise patterns of neural discharge in primary somatosensory cortex cannot be reliable estimates of sensory inputs reaching these neurons because patterns of discharge are so strongly influenced by intrinsic membrane properties. Ionic conductances governing patterns of neuronal discharge seem almost identical in intact cortex of raccoon, rat, and cat, and in slices of rodent cortex, because similar patterns of discharge are found. The consistency of patterns of discharge across species and types of preparation suggests that these intrinsic membrane properties are a general property of cerebral cortical neurons and should be considered when evaluating sensory coding by these neurons.;QUEENS UNIV,DEPT PHYSIOL,MRC,SENSORY MOTOR PHYSIOL GRP,KINGSTON,ON K7L 3N6,CANADA;Queens University - Canada;;;;;;;;;58;22;22;0;3;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The anterograde tracers Fluoro-Ruby (FR), Alexa Fluor (AT), and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into physiologically identified regions of rat SI. Injection locations were confirmed by examining the SI barrel fields and limb representations in tangential sections processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Experimental animals were divided into two groups: one group received multiple tracer injections in neighboring SI regions that represent separate body parts (whiskers, forepaw, and hindpaw); the other group received injections in SI areas that represent different components of the forelimb (forepaw, antebrachium, and brachium). The distribution of labeled terminals and their varicosities in the neostriatum and in the thalamus were plotted and quantitatively analyzed. For most animals, tracer overlap in the thalamus was either minimal or completely absent. In the neostriatum, projections from the whisker, forelimb, and hindlimb representations terminated in regions that rarely overlap with each other, while those originating from different parts of the forelimb representation were more likely to terminate in overlapping parts of the neostriatum. To the extent that neostriatal activation depends on corticostriatal convergence, the corticostriatal projections in the sensorimotor channel appeared to be organized so that neostriatal neurons may signal when multiple components of the same body part are activated simultaneously.";"Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA";"Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Millersville University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health";Alloway, KD (corresponding author), Milton S Hershey Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci H109, 500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.;kdal@psu.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-37532] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;55;49;49;0;1;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We recorded the resting FMRI signal from 16 patients and 22 controls. We used seed-based functional correlation analyses to calculate partial correlations of all voxels in the hippocampus relative to characteristic regional signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while controlling for ventricular CSF and white matter signals. Group comparisons were carried out controlling for age, gender, hippocampal volume and brain volume. The strength of functional connectivity in each region also was correlated with neuropsychological measures. We found that the hippocampus can be segmented into three distinct functional subregions (head, body, and tail), according to the relative connectivity with PFC, PCC and thalamus, respectively. The AD group showed stronger hippocampus-PFC and weaker hippocampus-PCC functional connectivity, the magnitudes of which correlated with MMSE in both cases. The results are consistent with an adaptive role of the PFC in the context of progression of dysfunction in PCC during earlier stages of AD. Extension of our approach could integrate regional volume measures for the hippocampus with their functional connectivity patterns in ways that should increase sensitivity for assessment of AD onset and progression.

Here, I briefly summarize single-axon results from representative examples of thalamocortical, corticocortical, callosal, and lateral intrinsic connections, with attention to implications for cortical organization. Particularly worth emphasizing is the intricate spatial configuration and striking morphometric heterogeneity of individual axons even within the same system of connections. A short section touches on patterns of axonal trajectories in the distal, preterminal few millimeters. Emphasis is on studies in nonhuman primates from about 1983 to present, with non-viral tracers and 2-D reconstruction (i.e., compressed z-axis) in the early visual cortical pathway. The last section recapitulates what this approach can tell us about inter-areal communication and cortical organization, and possible implications for dynamics and effective connectivity, and concludes with comments on open questions and future directions.;[Rockland, Kathleen S.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St, Boston, MA 02118 USA;Boston University;Rockland, KS (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;krock@bu.edu;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;106;18;18;1;13;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

Both the magnocellular (M)- and the parvocellular (P)-cell populations scale allometrically with brain volume in primates, P cells with a significantly higher slope such that, for every increase in M neuron number, P neuron numbers more than double (ln scale; y=0.89x+2.42R(2)=0.664). In diurnal primates, the ratio of P to M cells was slightly but significantly higher than in nocturnal primates. For all mammals, including primates, LGN volume was unrelated to nocturnal or diurnal niche but showed marked differences in slope and intercept depending on taxonomic group. The allometric scaling of M and P cells can be related to the order of neurogenesis, with late-generated P cells increasing with positive allometry compared with the earlier-generated M cells. This developmental regularity links relative foveal representation to relative isocortex enlargement, which is also generated late. The small increase in the P/M cell ratio in diurnal primates may result from increased developmental neuron loss in the M-cell population as it competes for limited termination zones in primary visual cortex.

This is made up of the ''system of the basal ganglia'' itself plus its inputs and outputs. The system of rile basal ganglia may be divided into the ''basal ganglia core'' comprising the striatum and its pallidal and nigral targets and the ''regulators of the core''. Distinguishable include regulators of the striatum (the dopaminergic pars compacta and the central complex of the thalamus or centre median-parafascicularis), regulators of the pallidonigrum (the subthalamic nucleus and the pedunculopontine complex) and internal regulators (at first the lateral nucleus of the pallidum). The main input to this system comes from the cerebral cortex. The main output is the thalamus and from it to the cortex. The whole ''basal ganglia related system'' may thus be seen as a cortico-cortical circuit passing through the basal ganglia. Information processing in the system is very complex. New data presented here emphasize two connections: cortico-striate and striato-pallidonigral connections. It is stressed that the first uses complex combinations of confluence or difluence on small matricial islands. This step could be a selection and reorganisation of cortical information. The second process is a strong ''dynamically focused convergence'' combining information from different upstream sources in order to derive an adequate informational product for the production of harmonious and adaptated matricity.;HOP TENON, SERV MALAD SYST NERVEUX, F-75970 PARIS, FRANCE;"UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Tenon - APHP";PERCHERON, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPTL MOUVEMENT LA, 47 BD HOP, F-75013 PARIS 13, FRANCE.;;"Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018; Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;113;17;18;0;3;MASSON EDITEUR;MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9;21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE;0035-3787;2213-0004;;REV NEUROL-FRANCE;Rev.

The cortical regions occupied by these maps are generally believed to be determined initially by genetically controlled chemical markers during development, with thalamocortical afferent activity subsequently exerting a progressively increasing influence over time. Here we use a computational model to show that adjacent topographic maps with mirror-image symmetry can arise from activity-dependent synaptic changes whenever the distribution radius of afferents sufficiently exceeds that of horizontal intracortical interactions. Which map edges become adjacent is strongly influenced by the probability distribution of input stimuli during map formation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent synaptic changes may play a role in influencing how adjacent maps become Oriented following the initial establishment of cortical areas via genetically determined chemical markers. Further, the model unexpectedly predicts the occasional occurrence of adjacent maps with a different rotational symmetry. We speculate that such atypically oriented maps, in the context of otherwise normally interconnected cortical regions, might contribute to abnormal cortical information processing in some neurodevelopmental disorders.;"Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Neurol, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA";"University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park";Schulz, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, UMIACS, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;"rschulz@cs.umd.edu; reggia@cs.umd.edu";"Schulz, Reiner/A-5940-2011; Schulz, Reiner/H-4451-2011";"Schulz, Reiner/0000-0001-5047-7921; ";NINDS NIH HHS [NS35466] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;63;4;4;1;1;M I T PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;FIVE CAMBRIDGE CENTER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA;0899-7667;;;NEURAL COMPUT;Neural Comput.;MAY;2005;17;5;;;;;1059;1083;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0899766053491904;;;25;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Neurosciences & Neurology";914ZM;15829100;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000228267400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies of the auditory cortex in nonhuman primates revealed a comparable architecture, in which core areas, receiving direct input from the thalamus, in turn, provide input to a surrounding belt.

Individuals with facilitated pain processing and/or reduced pain-modulatory capabilities are regarded as pronociceptive, whereas individuals with reduced pain processing capacity are characterized as antinociceptive. Brodmann area (BA) 3a of the primary somatosensory cortex is part of an ascending pathway from the sensory thalamus that mediates TSP. Descending pain modulation involves projections from the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to the periaqueductal gray to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Here, we tested the hypothesis that pronociceptive individuals have an enhanced TSP response compared with antinociceptive individuals, marked by facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and/or reduced capacity for descending pain modulation. Eighty healthy humans were tested with a TSP protocol and underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found large interindividual differences in TSP responses, which were positively correlated with functional connectivity (FC) between individuals' right sensory thalamus with their BA 3a (thal-BA 3a), and with cortical thickness in their insula and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, TSP was negatively correlated with FC between individuals' RVM with their sgACC (RVM-sgACC). When subjects were grouped as pronociceptive or antinociceptive based on whether they had greater thal-BA 3a or RVM-sgACC FC respectively, pronociceptive subjects showed greater TSP responses. Furthermore, TSP was positively correlated with the extent of imbalance toward ascending nociceptive processing. Our study indicates that individuals with enhanced TSP have facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and reduced pain-modulatory capacities.;"[Cheng, Joshua C.; Erpelding, Nathalie; Kucyi, Aaron; DeSouza, Danielle D.; Davis, Karen D.] Toronto Western Hosp, Div Brain Imaging & Behav Syst, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Cheng, Joshua C.; Kucyi, Aaron; DeSouza, Danielle D.; Davis, Karen D.] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 2J7, Canada; [Davis, Karen D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Toronto, ON M5T 1P5, Canada";"University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto";Davis, KD (corresponding author), Toronto Western Hosp, 399 Bathurst St,Room MP14-306, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.;kdavis@uhnres.utoronto.ca;DeSouza, Danielle/J-9821-2019;"DeSouza, Danielle/0000-0001-6861-5691; Cheng, Joshua/0000-0002-4305-4792";"Canadian Institutes of Health Research [MOP 10626]; Queen Elizabeth II/Purdue Pharma Scholarship in Science and Technology; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg [PDR-09-023]";"Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Queen Elizabeth II/Purdue Pharma Scholarship in Science and Technology; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund)";This work was funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 10626).

Methods Healthy controls and migraineurs were categorized according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Photophobia was measured under full-field illumination using electromyography in response to narrowband lights spanning the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra. Migraineurs were tested during their interictal headache-free period. Melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil responses quantified intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cell (ipRGC) function. Results A model combining the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra best described photophobia thresholds in controls and migraineurs; melanopsin contributions were similar to 1.5x greater than cone luminance. In the illumination range causing photophobia, migraineurs had lower photophobia thresholds (similar to 0.55 log units; p < 0.001) and higher post-illumination pupil response amplitudes (p = 0.03) than controls. Conclusion Photophobia is driven by melanopsin and cone luminance inputs to the cortex via the retino-thalamocortical pathway. In migraineurs, lower photophobia thresholds reflect hypersensitivity of ipRGC and cone luminance pathways, with the larger and prolonged post-illumination pupil response amplitude indicative of a supranormal melanopsin response. Our findings inform artificial lighting strategies incorporating luminaires with low melanopsin excitation and photopic luminance to limit the lighting conditions leading to photophobia.";"[Zele, Andrew J.; Dey, Ashim; Adhikari, Prakash; Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Vis & Eye Res, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Zele, Andrew J.; Adhikari, Prakash] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dey, Ashim; Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Feigl, Beatrix] Queensland Eye Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";"Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland Eye Institute";Feigl, B (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Ctr Vis & Eye Res, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.;b.feigl@qut.edu.au;Adhikari, Prakash/AFO-8162-2022;Adhikari, Prakash/0000-0003-4834-8500;;;;;53;11;11;0;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0333-1024;1468-2982;;CEPHALALGIA;Cephalalgia;FEB;2021;41;2;;;;;217;226;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0333102420963850;;;10;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;QC0UH;33040593;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000614549100009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Comparable projections have yet to be described in the primate brain, where part of the problem has been in effectively delineating these nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue from a series of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) showed that cells in the region of both the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei selectively stain for parvalbumin, thus helping to reveal these nuclei. These same tegmental nuclei were not selectively revealed when tissue was stained for SMI32, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or calretinin. In a parallel study, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the mammillary bodies of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Retrogradely labeled neurons were consistently found in the three subdivisions of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, which are located immediately below, within, and above the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Further projections to the mammillary body region arose from cells in the anterior tegmental nucleus, which appears to be a rostral continuation of the infrafascicular part of the ventral tegmental nucleus. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, labeled cells were most evident when the tracer injection was more laterally placed in the mammillary bodies, consistent with a projection to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The present study not only demonstrates that the primate mammillary bodies receive parallel inputs from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden, but also helps to confirm the extent of these poorly distinguished nuclei in the monkey brain.

Design: Functional and structural neuroimaging using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Setting: University medical center research facility. Patients: Three patients with complete homonymous hemianopia after acute infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery. Main Outcome Measures: Anatomical location of activated structures during horizontal optokinetic stimulation and T-2-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Occipitotemporal cortical areas (Brodmann areas 39 and 40) were the only activated cortical structures that showed statistically significant (P < .01) activation on the affected hemisphere. Of the subcortical areas, activation of thalamic nuclei appeared to be missing on the affected side, whereas the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus) were bilaterally activated. Conclusions: Bilateral activation of the basal ganglia confirms the concept of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loop and of the efference copy of oculomotor pathways from each hemisphere. Our findings suggest 2 possible explanations for the activation of occipitotemporal areas (the human homolog of middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas) on the infarcted hemisphere: involvement of direct extrastriatal visual pathways or interhemispheric callosal connections between right and left middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas.;"Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neuroradiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany";"University of Munich; University of Munich";Brandt, T (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Dept Neurol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.;;;;;;;;31;39;39;0;1;AMER MEDICAL ASSOC;CHICAGO;515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA;0003-9942;;;ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO;Arch.

Because of technical constraints, the precise effects of TMS on cortical circuits are difficult to assess experimentally. Here, this issue is investigated by constructing a detailed model of a portion of the thalamocortical system and examining the effects of the simulated delivery of a TMS pulse. The model, which incorporates a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints, includes 33,000 spiking neurons arranged in a 3-layered motor cortex and over 5 million intra- and interlayer synaptic connections. The model was validated by reproducing several results from the experimental literature. These include the frequency, timing, dose response, and pharmacological modulation of epidurally recorded responses to TMS (the so-called I-waves), as well as paired-pulse response curves consistent with data from several experimental studies. The modeled responses to simulated TMS pulses in different experimental paradigms provide a detailed, self-consistent account of the neural and synaptic activities evoked by TMS within prototypical cortical circuits.;"Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Neurosci Training Program, Madison, WI 53719 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Tononi, G (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk Blvd, Madison, WI 53719 USA.;gtononi@wisc.edu;Tononi, Giulio/B-8387-2009;Hill, Sean/0000-0001-8055-860X;NIGMS NIH HHS [GM-07507] Funding Source: Medline;NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS));;;105;113;125;0;22;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Responsiveness of neurons in the distal forelimb region of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was examined in cat in association with the cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the corresponding region of the second somatosensory area (SII). The aim was to test whether a component of the stimulus-generated tactile input to SI came via an indirect, intracortical path from the thalamus through SIT, or whether, when SI responsiveness fell in association with STI inactivation, the effect could be explained by a disfacilitation of the SI neuron; that is, a removal of a tonic facilitatory influence on the SI neuron that arises from within SII. 2. The responses of 33 SI neurons to controlled tactile stimuli, usually l-s long trains of vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the skin of the distal forelimb, were examined quantitatively before, during, and after the rapid, reversible inactivation of the SII area. 3. Nineteen of the 33 neurons (similar to 60%) were unaffected in their response level by SII inactivation. These included neurons of several functional classes whose input came from different classes of tactile afferent fibers, including the Pacinian corpuscle (PC) associated fibers, other rapidly adapting (RA) afferents from glabrous skin, and presumed hair follicle afferent (HFA) fibers. The remaining 14 neurons (similar to 40%). which also included different functional classes, displayed a reduction in response level with SII inactivation. Because this was not accompanied by significant prolongation of the SI spike waveforms, it is not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SII to SI. Construction of stimulus-response relations demonstrated that any effect of SII inactivation on individual SI neurons was consistent over the whole response range. 4. The fall in responsiveness for some SI neurons in association with SII inactivation may be attributable to disfacilitation, that is, a loss of tonic facilitation arising in SII, rather than to a block of peripherally generated inputs that traverse an indirect path from the skin to SI, via SII. There are three reasons for suggesting this. First, in the course of SII cooling, the latency and time course of SI evoked potentials were not delayed in a way that might be expected if part of the SI response had come via SII. Second, the SII inactivation could reduce the SI spontaneous activity (as well as the stimulus-related responsiveness). The facilitation from Sn is therefore not necessarily dependent on overt tactile stimulation, and its source may therefore be endogenous to SII. 5. Third, phase locking in the responses of SI neurons activated by vibrotactile stimuli was unchanged with SII inactivation, whether the response level was reduced or unaffected. Had the tactile inputs to SI come via both a direct and an indirect path (through SII) from the thalamus, the inactivation of SII should have eliminated some temporal differences in the inputs to the SI neurons and should have resulted in a tightening of phase locking in the responses to vibration. However, this was not seen. 6. The results demonstrate that tactile inputs to SI are conveyed over a direct path from the thalamus and do not appear to be carried over an indirect serially organized path through SII. However, there is evidence that SII can exert a background facilitatory influence on SI responsiveness. The observations are qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar to earlier ones on the effects of SI on SII responsiveness in the cat, and they confirm that, in this species, SI and SIT constitute spatially separate cortical areas organized in parallel for the processing of incoming tactile information from the thalamus, but with each capable of modulatory influences on the responsiveness of the other area.";UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA;University of New South Wales Sydney;;;Morley, John W/A-5311-2009;Morley, John/0000-0001-9246-853X;;;;;36;26;26;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The deficits likely derive from neural injury, reflected as structural damage and impaired functional brain responses to ventilatory and autonomic challenges. Brain structures playing essential memory roles, including the hippocampus and anterior thalamus, are damaged in CCHS. Other memory formation circuitry, the fornix and mammillary bodies, have not been evaluated. We collected two high-resolution T1-weighted image series from 14 CCHS and 31 control subjects, using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Image series were averaged and reoriented to a standard template; areas containing the mammillary bodies and fornices were over sampled, and body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were calculated and compared between groups. Both left and right mammillary body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in CCHS over control subjects, controlling for age, gender, and intracranial volume. Damage to these structures may contribute to memory deficiencies found in CCHS. Hypoxic processes, together with diminished neuroprotection from micronutrient deficiencies secondary to fluid and dietary absorption issues, may contribute to the injury.

How the brain constructs these coherent firing patterns remains largely unknown. Several mechanisms of intracortical synchronization have been considered, in particular mutual inhibition and reciprocal excitation. These mechanisms fail to account for the zero-lag correlations observed among areas located at different levels in the visual hierarchy because the asymmetric laminar organization of ascending and descending connections in this hierarchy would predict systematic inter-areal phase lags. Here we show through detailed computer simulations that, when triplets rather than pairs of reciprocally connected areas in a cortical hierarchy are considered, zero-lag synchronization emerges naturally from their three-way interactions. These simulations were motivated by the observation that most areas in the cat and macaque monkey visual cortex are organized in such triplets. Our results suggest that patterns of anatomical connections in the mammalian neocortex provide a structural basis for the multi-level synchronization of neuronal activity.

In our study, we investigated first the potential neurotoxic effects of remifentanil on the developing brain and then the effects of remifentanil on isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the neonatal rat brain following exposure to a nociceptive stimulus. In the first experiment, postnatal day (P) 7 rats were randomly exposed to 30% oxygen, 1.5% isoflurane alone, 1.5% isoflurane and a plantar incision, normal saline, or remifentanil at a low (5 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), moderate (20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) or high (80 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) dose for 4 h. In the second 4-h experiment, P7 rats were randomly exposed to 1.5% isoflurane, infused with different doses of remifentanil (5, 10, and 20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), and subjected to a plantar incision. In both experiments, the number of apoptotic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus was assessed after two hours by cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL staining. Our data showed that unlike 1.5% isoflurane, remifentanil at any dose did not cause significant neuronal apoptosis in any brain section. In addition, in response to a nociceptive stimulus, the infusion of 10 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1) remifentanil reduced isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus (P = 0.003 in CA1, P = 0.002 in CA3) but not in the cortex or thalamus.

At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.;"[Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Dept Technol, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Thiele, Alexander] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England";"ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";Deco, G (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Dept Technol, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.;gustavo.deco@upf.edu;"2010, BRAINGLOT Consolider Ingenio/D-1235-2009; DECO, GUSTAVO/A-6341-2008";"DECO, GUSTAVO/0000-0002-8995-7583; Thiele, Alexander/0000-0003-4894-0213";"BBSRC; Wellcome Trust; Spanish Research Project [SAF2010-16085]; CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 Programme [CSD2007-00012]; BBSRC [BB/F021399/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [G0700976] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/F021399/1, BBS/B/09325] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700976] Funding Source: researchfish; ICREA Funding Source: Custom";"BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Spanish Research Project(Spanish Government); CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 Programme(Spanish Government); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); ICREA(ICREA)";AT was supported by the BBSRC and the Wellcome Trust.

Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli.

Patients were studied in three conditions, (a) before MCS (Baseline, stimulator stopped 4 weeks before), (b) during a 35-min period of MCS and (c) during a 75-min period after MCS had been discontinued (OFF). Compared to Baseline, turning on the stimulator was associated with CBF increase in the contralateral (anterior) midcingulate cortex (aMCC, BA24 and 32) and in the dorso-lateral prefrontal (BA10) cortices. The most important changes of CBF were observed in the 75 min after discontinuation of MCS (OFF). This post-stimulation period was associated with CBF increases in a large set of cortical and subcortical regions (from posterior MCC (pMCC) to pregenual (pg) ACC, orbitufrontal cortex, putamen, thalami, posterior cingulate and prefrontal areas) and in the brainstem (mesencephalon/periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pons). CBF changes in the post-stimulation period correlated with pain relief. Functional connectivity analysis showed significant correlation between pgACC and PAG, basal ganglia, and lower pons activities, supporting the activation of descending ACC-to-PAG connections. MCS may act in part through descending (top-down) inhibitory controls that involve prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ACC as well as basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem. These hemodynamic changes are lengthened and might therefore underlie the long-lasting clinical effects that largely outlast the actual stimulation periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal. Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus, the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of experiencing negative emotions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Current evidence suggests that pathological brain connectivity could be a major contributor to the propagation of focal seizures, constituting a possible cause for some forms of intractable epilepsy. Currently, however, the precise network structures that underpin epileptic brain connectivity are poorly understood. In this study, we use a computational model to simulate focal seizure spread in the macaque cortical connectome. We then use the results to propose a novel network centrality measure (called Ictogenic Centrality) that accurately identifies which nodes are most effective in propagating seizures. In the framework presented, ictogenic centrality outperforms other standard centrality measures in correctly identifying ictogenic nodes, exhibiting high accuracy (0.947), specificity (0.939), and sensitivity (0.964). Ictogenic centrality is degree based and relies on only a single free parameter, making it useful and efficient to compute for large networks. Our results suggest that baseline brain connectivity may predispose the temporal and frontal lobes toward ictogenicity even in the absence of any overtly pathological network reorganization.;"[Emerson, Joseph] Ohio Wesleyan Univ, 61 South Sandusky St, Delaware, OH 43015 USA; [Afelin, Amber] Wesleyan Univ, 45 Wyllys Ave, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Fink, Christian G.] Gonzaga Univ, 502 East Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258 USA";"Ohio Wesleyan University; Wesleyan University; Gonzaga University";Fink, CG (corresponding author), Gonzaga Univ, 502 East Boone Ave, Spokane, WA 99258 USA.;"jhemerso@owu.edu; aafelin@wesleyan.edu; vsliupas@gmail.com; finkt@gonzaga.edu";;Fink, Christian/0000-0003-1214-8902;;;;;75;1;1;1;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0938-8974;1432-1467;;J NONLINEAR SCI;J.

Cross-modal modulation can similarly enhance a neuronal representation, and this process can also operate at the primary cortical level. Phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity has been shown to be an important element of the underlying modulation of local cortical excitability in both cases. We investigated the influence of attention on oscillatory phase reset in primary auditory and visual cortices of macaques performing an intermodal selective attention task. In addition to responses driven by preferred modality stimuli, we noted that both preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli could modulate local cortical excitability by phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity, and that this effect was linked to their being attended. These findings outline a supramodal mechanism by which attention can control neurophysiological context, thus determining the representation of specific sensory content in primary sensory cortex.;"[Lakatos, Peter; O'Connell, Monica N.; Barczak, Annamaria; Mills, Aimee; Javitt, Daniel C.; Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Barczak, Annamaria] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Neurosci, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Lakatos, Peter; Javitt, Daniel C.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; New York University; Columbia University";Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;plakatos@nki.rfmh.org;Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019;"Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021";NIMH [MH061989, MH060358];NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));We thank Dr. Ashesh D.

The mechanisms by which such a large-scale network could induce or modulate anxiety-like states are largely unknown. This article reviews our experimental program in macaques demonstrating a causal involvement of local striatal and frontal cortical sites in inducing pessimistic decision-making that underlies anxiety. Where relevant, we related these findings to the wider literature. To identify such sites, we have made a series of methodologic advances, including the combination of causal evidence for behavioral modification of pessimistic decisions with viral tracing methods. Critically, we introduced a version of the classic approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) conflict task, modified for use in non-human primates. We performed microstimulation of limbic-related cortical regions and the striatum, focusing on the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (cOFC), and the caudate nucleus (CN). Microstimulation of localized sites within these regions induced pessimistic decision-making by the monkeys, supporting the idea that the focal activation of these regions could induce an anxiety-like state, which subsequently influences decision-making. We further performed combined microstimulation and tract-tracing experiments by injecting anterograde viral tracers into focal regions, at which microstimulation induced increased avoidance. We found that effective stimulation sites in both pACC and cOFC zones projected preferentially to striosomes in the anterior striatum. Experiments in rodents have shown that the striosomes in the anterior striatum project directly to the dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and we have found evidence for a functional connection between striosomes and the lateral habenular region in which responses to reward are inhibitory. We present here further evidence for network interactions: we show that the pACC and cOFC project to common structures, including not only the anterior parts of the striosome compartment but also the tail of the CN, the subgenual ACC, the amygdala, and the thalamus. Together, our findings suggest that networks having pACC and cOFC as nodes share similar features in their connectivity patterns. We here hypothesize, based on these results, that the brain sites related to pessimistic judgment are mediated by a large-scale brain network that regulates dopaminergic functions and includes striosomes and striosome-projecting cortical regions.;"[Amemori, Satoko; Amemori, Ken-ichi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol, Kyoto, Japan; [Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Graybiel, Ann M.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";"Kyoto University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)";"Amemori, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Inst Adv Study Human Biol, Kyoto, Japan.;Graybiel, AM (corresponding author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Graybiel, AM (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.";"graybiel@mit.edu; amemori.kenichi.7s@kyoto-u.ac.jp";;Graybiel, Ann/0000-0002-4326-7720;"NIH/NINDS [R01 NS025529]; NIH/NIMH [R01 MH060379, P50 MH119467]; Army Research Office [W911NF-16-1-0474]; Saks Kavanaugh Foundation; CHDI Foundation; ONR [N00014-07-1-090]; SCSB (Simons Foundation); McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Takeda Science Foundation; Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant; JSPS KAKENHI [JP21K07259, JP20H05469, JP20H05063, JP18K19497, JP20H03555]; AMED-SICORP [20349155]";"NIH/NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NIH/NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Army Research Office; Saks Kavanaugh Foundation; CHDI Foundation; ONR(Office of Naval Research); SCSB (Simons Foundation); McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); AMED-SICORP";"Original research summarized here was supported by NIH/NINDS grant R01 NS025529, NIH/NIMH grants R01 MH060379 and P50 MH119467, Army Research Office grant W911NF-16-1-0474, the Saks Kavanaugh Foundation, CHDI Foundation, ONR with Kramer (Office of Naval Research grant N00014-07-1-090), SCSB (grant from the Simons Foundation to the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT), and McGovern Institute for Brain Research; Data analyses and researches were supported by Takeda Science Foundation, Sumitomo Foundation Basic Science Grant, AMED-SICORP 20349155, and JSPS KAKENHI Grant numbers JP21K07259, JP20H05469, JP20H05063, JP18K19497 and JP20H03555.";;107;2;2;1;7;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-453X;;FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ;Front.

They often respond poorly to dopaminergic treatments. Although recent studies have shed some light on their neural correlates, their modulation by dopaminergic treatment remains quite unknown. Specifically, the influence of levodopa on the networks involved in motor imagery (MI) of parkinsonian gait has not been directly studied, comparing the off and on medication states in the same patients. We therefore conducted an [H(2)(15)0] Positron emission tomography study in eight advanced parkinsonian patients (mean disease duration: 12.3 +/- 3.8 years) presenting with levodopa-responsive gait disorders and FoG, and eight age-matched healthy subjects. All participants performed three tasks (MI of gait, visual imagery and a control task). Patients were tested off, after an overnight withdrawal of all antiparkinsonian treatment, and on medication, during consecutive mornings. The order of conditions was counterbalanced between subjects and sessions. Results showed that imagined gait elicited activations within motor and frontal associative areas, thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum in controls. Off medication, patients mainly activated premotor-parietal and pontomesencephalic regions. Levodopa increased activation in motor regions, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, and reduced premotor-parietal and brainstem involvement. Areas activated when patients are off medication may represent compensatory mechanisms. The recruitment of these accessory circuits has also been reported for upper-limb movements in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a partly overlapping pathophysiology between imagined levodopa-responsive gait disorders and appendicular signs. Our results also highlight a possible cerebellar contribution in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait disorders through kinesthetic imagery.

These corticothalamic neurons mediate widespread inhibition across all cortical layers by recruiting fast-spiking inhibitory neurons whose cell body resides in deep cortical layers yet whose axons arborize throughout all layers.

The following components of the somatosensory evoked potentials were simultaneously recorded from 21-27 epidural electrodes: P7 (the letter indicates positive or negative polarity; the number indicates the approximate latency of the peak in ms) was recorded widely from various locations on both the left and right hemispheres, P10 was recorded near the anterior side of the central sulcus contralateral to the stimulation side, N10 was recorded near the posterior side of the contralateral central sulcus, P12 was recorded on both sides of the contralateral central sulcus, and P18 was recorded posterior to the contralateral central sulcus. Current source generators (dipoles) of each component of somatosensory evoked potentials were localized by dipole tracing: a dipole for P7 was located in the thalamus contralateral to the stimulation side; a dipole for P10 and N10 in the posterior wall of the contralateral central sulcus (area 3b); a dipole for P12 in the contralateral post central gyrus (areas 1 and 2); and a dipole for P18 in the anterior wall of the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (area 5). The locations and latencies of dipoles that generated cortical components of somatosensory evoked potentials, estimated by dipole tracing, were confirmed by direct cortical surface recording from a 16-25 electrode array placed directly on the cortical surface; and multiple unit recording from the anterior and posterior parietal cortices. After excision of area 5, P18 and N18 were abolished, whereas P10, N10, and P12 were not affected.

We found that these areas receive major disynaptic inputs from specific portions of the cerebellar nuclei, the ventral dentate (D), and ventrolateral interpositus posterior (IP). Area LIPv receives inputs from oculomotor domains of the caudal D and IP. Area MIP is the target of projections from the ventral D (mainly middle third), and gaze- and arm-related domains of IP involved in reaching and arm/eye/head coordination. We also showed that cerebellar cortical output channels to MIP predominantly stem from posterior cerebellar areas (paramedian lobe/Crus II posterior, dorsal paraflocculus) that have the required connectivity for adaptive control of visual and proprioceptive guidance of reaching, arm/eye/head coordination, and prism adaptation. These findings provide important insight about the interplay between the posterior parietal cortex and the cerebellum regarding visuospatial adaptation mechanisms and visual and proprioceptive guidance of movement.

During each fixation, in addition to analyzing the object at which we are looking, a decision has to be made as to where to look next. Although we perform this task with the greatest of ease, the computations to perform the task are complex and involve numerous brain structures. We have applied several investigative tools that include single-cell recordings, microstimulation, pharmacological manipulations and lesions to learn more about the neural control of visually guided eye saccadic movements. Electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), areas V1 and V2, the lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP), the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the medial eye fields (MEF) produces saccadic eye movements at low current levels. After ablation of the SC, electrical microstimulation of V1, V2, and LIP no longer elicits saccadic eye movements whereas stimulation of the FEF and MEF continues to be effective. Ablation of the SC but not of the FEF eliminates short-latency saccadic eye movements to Visual targets called express saccades, whereas lesions of the FEF selectively interfere with target selection. Bilateral removal of both the SC and the FEF causes major, long lasting deficits: all visually elicited saccadic eye movements are eliminated. In intact monkeys, subthreshold electrical microstimulation of the FEF and MEF as well as the lower layers of V1 and V2 and of some subregions of LIP greatly facilitates the choice of targets presented in the receptive fields of the stimulated neurons. By contrast, stimulation of the upper layers of V1 and V2 and other sub-regions of LIP produces a dramatic interference in target selection. Examination of the role of inhibitory circuits in eye-movement generation reveals that local infusion of muscimol, a GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) agonist, or bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, interferes with target selection in V1. On the other hand, infusion of bicuculline into the FEF produces facilitation in target choice and irrepressible saccades. It appears therefore that inhibitory circuits play a central role in visual analysis in V1 and in the generation of saccadic eye movements in the FEF. It is proposed that two major streams can be discerned in visually guided eye-movement control, the posterior from occipital and parietal cortex that reaches the brainstem via the SC and the anterior from the FEF and MEF that has direct access to the brainstem oculomotor centers.;MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA;Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT);Schiller, PH (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E25-634, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;phschill@mit.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY08502, EY00676] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;42;79;80;0;10;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-51679-4;PROG BRAIN RES;Prog.

Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information.

J. Neurophysiol. 83: 1019-1030, 2000. A fundamental feature of neural circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is the existence of recurrent excitatory connections between spiny neurons, recurrent inhibitory connections between smooth neurons, and local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modeled the dynamic behavior of intermixed excitatory and inhibitory populations of cells in V1 that receive input from the classical receptive field (the receptive field center) through feedforward thalamocortical afferents, as well as input from outside the classical:receptive field (the receptive field surround) via long-range intracortical connections. A counterintuitive result is that the response of oriented cells can be facilitated beyond optimal levels when the surround stimulus is cross-oriented with respect to the center and suppressed when the surround stimulus is iso-oriented. This effect is primarily due to changes in recurrent inhibition within a local circuit. Cross-oriented surround stimulation leads to a reduction of presynaptic inhibition and a supraoptimal response, whereas iso-oriented surround stimulation has the opposite effect. This mechanism is used to explain the orientation and contrast dependence of contextual interactions in primary visual cortex: responses to a center stimulus can be both strongly suppressed and supraoptimally facilitated as a function of surround orientation, and these effects diminish as stimulus contrast decreases.;MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA;Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT);Dragoi, V (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 45 Carleton St,E25-235, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY-07023] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;59;76;78;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

This study examined the unisensory and multisensory function of the rat insula using high-resolution, whole-hemisphere, epipial evoked potential mapping. We found the posterior insula to contain distinct auditory and somatotopically organized somatosensory fields with an interposed and overlapping region capable of integrating these sensory modalities. Unisensory and multisensory responses were uninfluenced by complete lesioning of primary and secondary auditory and somatosensory cortices, suggesting a high degree of parallel afferent input from the thalamus. In light of the established connections of the posterior insula with the amygdala, we propose that integration of auditory and somatosensory modalities reported here may play a role in auditory fear conditioning.;"[Rodgers, Krista M.; Benison, Alexander M.; Klein, Andrea; Barth, Daniel S.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA";"University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder";Barth, DS (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Campus Box 345, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;dbarth@psych.colorado.edu;Rodgers, Krista/AAC-5063-2020;RODGERS, KRISTA/0000-0003-4393-6389;"National Institutes of Health [NS36981]; University of Colorado Council for Research and Creative Work; University of Colorado Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Colorado Council for Research and Creative Work; University of Colorado Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program";"National Institutes of Health (NS36981); University of Colorado Council for Research and Creative Work; and University of Colorado Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.";;61;95;95;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Our goal was to determine if any brain regions are differentially activated by the attentional demands of these two search modes. We used fMRI to examine activation patterns during search for a target among a radial array of several distractors that were manipulated to produce efficient or inefficient search. Distractors for inefficient search were either uniform or varied to manipulate difficulty due to perceptual priming. No brain regions were uniquely activated by efficient or inefficient search, although inefficient search generally produced greater activations. The main differences were found in clusters in the superior occipital and superior parietal regions, for which activations were substantially greater for inefficient search. Similar results were found for frontal regions, such as the inferior prefrontal, superior frontal, anterior insula, and supplementary eye field, as well as the right ventral lateral thalamus. For inefficient search, increasing task difficulty resulted in low accuracy, but no difference in RT or activations. A working memory task utilizing the same display and response mode, but not involving search, activated the same frontal-parietal network as inefficient search (more so for the more difficult inefficient condition). Thus, our results identify brain regions that are more heavily recruited under conditions of inefficient search, independent of task difficultly per se, probably due in part to attentional modulation involving demands of eye movements, working memory, and top-down controls, but do not reveal independent networks related to efficient and inefficient search.

Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with several BV isolates. Comparisons were based upon the doses required to produce infection (ID50), non-central nervous system (CNS) clinical disease (CS50), CNS disease (CNSD50) and lethal effect (LD50). Strains differed in respect of the dose required to produce clinical disease in BALB/c mice. C57BL/6 mice were more resistant than BALB/c mice to CNS disease. Skin lesions at the inoculation site consisted of epidermal necrosis, ulceration, serocellular crusts and underlying dermatitis. CNS lesions included marked inflammation in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion and lumbar spinal cord (point. of viral entry). The distribution of the lumbar spinal cord lesions suggested viral entry via sensory afferent neurons, ventral motor tracts, or both. The lesions in the more cranial spinal cord segments suggested ascension to the brain via bilateral spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. Brain lesions included encephalitis with neuronal necrosis and white matter destruction located consistently at the base of the brainstem, the reticular system, and rostrally to the thalamus and hypothalamus. Viral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the lesions. The results indicated an ascending encephalomyelitis syndrome similar to that produced by BV in mail. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Early-enucleated fetuses (operated prior to embryonic day 77) showed morphological changes at the level of the thalamus and the cortex. In the thalamus, there was a loss of lamination and a decrease in size of the lateral geniculate nucleus. There was a decrease in the size of the inferior pulvinar, but there was no change in the lateral pulvinar. The border of striate cortex was as sharp in the enucleates as it was in the normal monkeys. In three of the four early enucleates, we observed an interdigitation of striate and extrastriate cortex. In three of the early enucleates, we observed a small island of nonstriate cortex near the striate border that was surrounded entirely by striate cortex. Enucleation led to an age-related reduction of striate cortex. This reduction was greater in the operculum than in the calcarine fissure. The reduction of striate cortex was accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of extrastriate visual cortex, so that the overall dimensions of the neocortex remained invariant. The extrastriate cortex in the enucleated animals presented a uniform cytoarchitecture and was indistinguishable from area 18 in the normal animal. There were changes in the gyral pattern that were restricted mainly to the cortex on the operculum. A deepening of minor dimples as well as the induction of a variable number of supplementary sulci led to an increase in the convolution of the occipital lobe. These results are discussed with respect to the specification of cortical areas. They demonstrate that the reduction in striate cortex was not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the neocortex; rather, there was a border shift, and a large volume of cor tex that was destined to become striate cortex appears to be cytoarchitectonically normal extrastriate cortex.

Methods-Forty-one patients participating in an inpatient stroke rehabilitation database, admitted 17+/-2 (SEM) days after initial unilateral hemispheric ischemic stroke, with neuroimaging studies performed >48 hours after stroke and with minimal upper limb (UL) movement (admission Fugl-Meyer UL motor scores less than or equal to9; normal score, 58) were studied. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their UL discharge Fugl-Meyer score: 0 to 9, no/poor recovery; 10 to 18, well-defined flexion-extension synergies; and >18, synergies + isolated movements. Lesions affecting the following structures were recorded: primary motor cortex, premotor area, supplementary motor area, anterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (secondary motor efferents), posterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (primary motor efferents), genu, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule (PLIC), basal ganglia, and thalamus. chi (2) Analysis and ANOVA were used to study the significance of stroke location on UL motor recovery. Results-The effect of involvement of primary, premotor, or supplementary motor areas on motor recovery did not reach statistical significance. Patients with purely cortical stroke were likely to recover UL isolated movement (3 of 4) compared with purely subcortical (1 of 17) or mixed cortical-subcortical stroke location (2 of 20) (P=0.009). Of those with cortical, subcortical, or mixed cortical plus subcortical lesions sparing the PLIC, 5 of 13 recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Only 1 of 28 patients with involvement of the PLIC plus adjacent corona radiata, basal ganglia, or thalamus recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Patients with small lacunar strokes affecting only the PLIC did not have sufficient motor deficits 2 weeks after stroke to meet inclusion criteria. Conclusions-The probability of recovery of isolated UL movement decreases progressively with lesion location as follows: cortex, corona radiata, and PLIC. This is consistent with our current understanding of redundant cortical motor representation and convergence of corticofugal motor efferents as they pass through the corona radiata to the PLIC.";"Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurol, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA; Cornell Univ, Burke Rehabil Hosp, Weill Med Coll, White Plains, NY USA";"University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine";Shelton, FDAP (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurol, 711 Stanton L Young Blvd,Suite 209, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 USA.;;;;;;;;46;236;252;2;13;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA;0039-2499;;;STROKE;Stroke;JAN;2001;32;1;;;;;107;112;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.STR.32.1.107;;;6;"Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology";389JF;11136923;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000166234300022;View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments in macaque monkeys show that these two kinds of impairment are functionally similar to each other. After any lesion that interrupts the Delay-Brion system (hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies and anterior thalamus) monkeys are impaired in scene-specific memory where an event takes place against a background that is specific to that event. Scene-specific memory in the monkey corresponds to human episodic memory, which is the memory of a unique event set in a particular scene, as opposed to scene-independent human knowledge, which is abstracted from many different scenes. However interruption of the Delay-Brion system is not sufficient to explain all of the memory impairments that are seen in amnesic patients. To explain amnesia the specialized function of the hippocampus in scene memory needs to be considered alongside the other, qualitatively different functional specializations of other memory systems of the temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex and the amygdala. In all these specialized areas, however, including the hippocampus, there is no fundamental distinction between memory systems and perceptual systems. In explaining memory disorders in amnesia it is also important to consider them alongside the memory disorders of neglect patients. Neglect patients fail to represent in memory the side of the world that is contralateral to the current fixation point, in both short-and long-term memory retrieval. Neglect was produced experimentally by unilateral visual disconnection in the monkey, confirming the idea that visual memory retrieval is retinotopically organized; patients with unilateral medial temporal-lobe removals showed lateralized memory impairments for half-scenes in the visual hemifield contralateral to the removal. Thus, in scene-memory retrieval the Delay-Brion system contributes to the retrieval of visual memories into the retinotopically organized visual cortex. This scene memory interpretation of hippocampal function needs to be contrasted with the cognitive-map hypothesis. The cognitive-map model of hippocampal function shares some common assumptions with the Hebb-synapse model of association formation, and the Hebb-synapse model can be rejected on the basis of recent evidence that monkeys can form direct associations in memory between temporally discontiguous events. Our general conclusion is that the primate brain encompasses widespread and powerful memory mechanisms which will continue to be poorly understood if theory and experimentation continue to concentrate too much, as they have in the past, on the hippocampus and the Hebb synapse.";;;Gaffan, D (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,DEPT EXPT PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;51;16;16;0;4;ROYAL SOC LONDON;LONDON;6 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON, ENGLAND SW1Y 5AG;0962-8436;;;PHILOS T ROY SOC B;Philos.

The dominant retinogeniculostriate pathway has been an area of extensive study, and Vivien Casagrande's work in examining the once overlooked koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus has generated interest in how alternate subcortical pathways can contribute to visual perception. Another subcortical visual relay center is the inferior pulvinar (PI), which has four subdivisions and numerous connections with other subcortical and cortical areas and is directly recipient of retinal afferents. The complexity of subcortical connections associated with the PI subdivisions has led to differing results from various groups. A particular challenge in determining the exact connectivity pattern has been in accurately targeting the subdivisions of the PI with neural tracers. Therefore, in the present study, we used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotaxic injection system to inject bidirectional tracers in the separate subdivisions of the PI, the superior layers of the superior colliculus, the retina, and the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results have determined for the first time that the medial inferior pulvinar (PIm) is innervated by widefield retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and this pathway is not a collateral branch of the geniculate and collicular projecting RGCs. Furthermore, our tracing data shows no evidence of collicular terminations in the PIm, which are confined to the centromedial and posterior PI.;"[Kwan, William C.; Mundinano, Inaki-Carril; de Souza, Mitchell J.; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Level 1,15 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Lee, Sammy C.

As a result, the functional roles of these subdivisions in humans have not been investigated physiologically. To functionally map the M and P subdivisions of human LGN, we used high-resolution fMRI at high field (7 T and 3 T) together with a combination of spatial, temporal, luminance, and chromatic stimulus manipulations. We found that stimulus factors that differentially drive magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in primate LGN also elicit differential BOLD fMRI responses in human LGN and that these responses exhibit a spatial organization consistent with the known anatomical organization of the M and P subdivisions. In test-retest studies, the relative responses of individual voxels to M-type and P-type stimuli were reliable across scanning sessions on separate days and across sessions at different field strengths. The ability to functionally identify magnocellular and parvocellular regions of human LGN with fMRI opens possibilities for investigating the functions of these subdivisions in human visual perception, in patient populations with suspected abnormalities in one of these subdivisions, and in visual cortical processing streams arising from parallel thalamocortical pathways.

Optical densitometry values of reacted tissue were obtained for 50 different structures of the brain. In general, most structures reached adult levels of oxidative capacity by 30 days of age with some motor areas (e.g., cerebellum, red nucleus) exhibiting adult values as early as 7 days of age. Thereafter, some structures (e.g., basal ganglia, thalamus) exhibited levels of cytochrome oxidase activity that exceeded adult values for varying periods of time. These findings indicate regional heterogeneity in the maturation of cerebral oxidative capacity.

It has long been assumed that cone opponent ganglion cells project to the parvocellular layers of the geniculate. Here, we examine the role of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets.

Colour facilitates object perception and recognition, and has an important role in scene segmentation and visual memory. Moreover, it provides an aesthetic component to visual experiences that is fundamental to our perception of the world. Despite the long history of colour vision studies, much has still to be learned about the physiological basis of colour perception. Recent advances in our understanding of the early processing in the retina and thalamus have enabled us to take a fresh look at cortical processing of colour. These studies are beginning to indicate that colour is processed not in isolation, but together with information about luminance and visual form, by the same neural circuits, to achieve a unitary and robust representation of the visual world.;Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany;Justus Liebig University Giessen;Gegenfurtner, KR (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.;gegenfurtner@uni-giessen.de;;Gegenfurtner, Karl/0000-0001-5390-0684;;;;;121;254;256;1;84;NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1471-003X;1471-0048;;NAT REV NEUROSCI;Nat.

The density of cones at the fovea has been shown to have a surprising degree of individual variability and the cone distribution is asymmetric about the fovea with a greater density of cones in nasal than temporal retina. Information about the fine detail of our visual world is carried to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in two parallel pathways. These pathways originate from two morphologically distinct types of ganglion cell; the M-ganglion cells project to the magnocellular layers, P-ganglion cells to the parvocellular layers.

An adult female Macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) weighing 7.2 kg was used in constructing this atlas. CT, PET, and MRI were performed on the monkey before the specimen's head was frozen and cryoplaned. Closely spaced (50 mu m) images of the specimen blockface were then digitally acquired and modified to produce whole head and brain-only 3D image sets. The resulting data sets were organized into a digital volume and repositioned into a stereotaxic coordinate system defined by Horsley and Clark in 1908 [7]. Orthogonal images were obtained by digitally resampling the volume in order to produce a full set of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal images. Stereotaxic reference grids were applied to each image indicating the A/P, M/L, or H-c position within the digital volume. Specific anatomic structures were outlined from the cryosection data set and 3D surface models reconstructed. Structural labels indicating nuclei, tracts, and other neuroanatomical features were incorporated into coronally sliced cryosection images spaced at 500 mu m. The CT, PET, and MRI data sets were reconstructed into a digital volume and coregistered to the cryosection volume. All images constructed from this 3D map are available for public access via the Internet using an anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP) and the World Wide Web (http://www.loni.ucla.edu). The foremost advantage of this digital map is an integrated multimodality three-dimensional representation of the Macaca nemestrina brain, which is not possible with traditional atlases.

Four to five days after virus injections into M1, we observed many densely labeled neurons in localized regions of the output nuclei of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The largest numbers of these neurons were found in portions of the dentate nucleus and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPI). Smaller numbers of labeled neurons were found in portions of the interpositus nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The distribution of neuronal labeling varied with the cortical injection site. For example, within the dentate, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located rostrally, those from face M1 caudally, and those from arm M1 at intermediate levels. In each instance, labeled neurons were confined to approximately the dorsal third of the nucleus. Within GPI, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located in dorsal and medial regions, those from face M1 in ventral and lateral regions, and those from arm M1 in intermediate regions. These results demonstrate that M1 is the target of somatotopically organized outputs from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia, Surprisingly, the projections to M1 originate from only 30% of the volume of the dentate and <15% of GPI, Thus, the majority of the outputs from the cerebellum and basal ganglia are directed to cortical areas other than M1.;"Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; Millersville Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Biol, Millersville, PA 17551 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurosci, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Physiol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA";"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Millersville University of Pennsylvania; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";Strick, PL (corresponding author), Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, 1515S, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.;;;;PHS HHS [151S] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;71;329;337;0;11;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The nexus of auditory activity is located in temporal cortex among several specialized areas, or fields, that receive dense inputs from the medial geniculate complex. These areas are collectively referred to as auditory cortex. Auditory activity is extended beyond auditory cortex via connections with auditory-related areas elsewhere in the cortex. Within this network, information flows between areas to and from countless targets, but in a manner that is characterized by orderly regional, areal and laminar patterns. These patterns reflect some of the structural constraints that passively govern the flow of information at all levels of the network. In addition, the exchange of information within these circuits is dynamically regulated by intrinsic neurochemical properties of projecting neurons and their targets. This article begins with an overview of the principal circuits and how each is related to information flow along major axes of the network. The discussion then turns to a description of neurochemical gradients along these axes, highlighting recent work on glutamate transporters in the thalamocortical projections to auditory cortex. The article concludes with a brief discussion of relevant neurophysiological findings as they relate to structural gradients in the network. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Pharmacological studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the plasticity of the visual cortex just as they are involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), another activity-dependent form of plasticity. The setting up of synaptic connectivity in the neocortex may rely on LTP-like mechanisms. By using immunohistochemistry techniques, we tested the hypothesis of the role of subunit R1 of NMDA (NMDAR1) receptors in the thalamocortical afferent segregation into ocular-dominance columns in the New World monkey, Callithrix jacchus. We employed early and short (2 weeks) monocular-deprivation periods at different ages of postnatal development(17, 46, 67, 107, and 188 postnatal days). We observed heterogeneous distribution of NMDAR1 in the layer IVC receiving the thalamic inputs if the deprivation was realized between the ages of 46 and 107 days. Layers IVC alpha and IVC beta were involved differently as a function of the deprivation age. The striped pattern lost its differential intensity with the postnatal age. These results are compared with the ocular-dominance pattern evolution described in other works on this primate. They provide evidence of the NMDAR1 role in the modular organization, within time limits, during the postnatal development of the primary visual cortex.

Here we report the first evidence that spatial coding in the pulvinar is defined by an object-based frame. We evaluated the efficiency of spatial coding in two patients with damage to spatial maps within the pulvinar. Patients located targets within a 2 x 2 (up/down x left/right) search array, which was itself located within a 2 x 2 retinotopic space.

To elucidate the neuronal mechanisms and origin of ECRF suppression in V1 of anesthetized cats, we examined the temporal properties of the spatial extent and orientation specificity of ECRF suppression in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), using stationary-flashed sinusoidal grating. In V1, we found three components of ECRF suppression: 1) local and fast, 2) global and fast, and 3) global and late. The local and fast component, which resulted from within 2 of the boundary of the CRF, started no more than 10 ms after the onset of the CRF response and exhibited low specificity for the orientation of the ECRF stimulus. These spatiotemporal properties corresponded to those of geniculate ECRF suppression, suggesting that the local and fast component of V1 is inherited from the LGN. In contrast, the two global components showed rather large spatial extents similar to 5 degrees from the CRF boundary and high specificity for orientation, suggesting that their possible origin is the cortex, not the LGN. Correspondingly, the local component was observed in all neurons of the thalamocortical recipient layer, while the global component was biased toward other layers. Therefore, we conclude that both subcortical and cortical mechanisms with different spatiotemporal properties are involved in ECRF suppression.;"[Shimegi, Satoshi; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan; [Shimegi, Satoshi; Ishikawa, Ayako; Sakamoto, Hiroshi; Hara, Sin-ichiro; Sato, Hiromichi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan; [Kida, Hiroyuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan";"Osaka University; Osaka University; Osaka University";Shimegi, S (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Toyonaka, Osaka 560, Japan.;shimegi@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp;;;"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [12210098, 13210086, 14017058, 16015270, 17022026, 19530656, 22500573, 25282216]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25282216, 22500573, 12210098, 13210086, 25750206, 16015270, 14017058, 19530656, 17022026] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This work was supported by Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Grants 12210098, 13210086, 14017058, 16015270, and 17022026 to H.

We injected rabies into the primary motor cortex (M1) or into Area 46 of cebus monkeys. A 4-day survival time was long enough to allow transport of rabies from the injection site to 'third-order' neurons in the basal ganglia. After either MI or Area 46 injections, third-order neurons were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). In each of these nuclei, the third-order neurons that innervate M1 were spatially separated from those that innervate Area 46. Thus, distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits innervate M1 and Area 46. Next, we injected a conventional tracer into M1 to define its terminations in the putamen and STN. We found that the regions of the putamen and STN that receive input from M1 are the same as those that contain third-order neurons after M1 injections of virus. On the other hand, virus injections into M1 also labeled a relatively dense group of third-order neurons in a region of the ventral putamen that is not innervated by M1. This region of the putamen is the target of efferents from the amygdala. Thus, the ventral putamen may provide a route for the limbic system to influence motor output. Overall, our results indicate that basal ganglia circuits with the cerebral cortex can be characterized by both open- and closed-loop macro-architectures.;"Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceut Res & Dev, San Diego, CA 92121 USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA";Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.;strickp@pitt.edu;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH 56661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 24328] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;43;163;164;0;16;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-51389-2;PROG BRAIN RES;Prog.

We studied the nature of the modulatory effects of SRF stimulation with respect to stimulus contrast in cat V1. In 51 V1 neurons studied, large SRF stimuli (40 degrees x 30 degrees) induced only the suppression of responses to CRF stimulation and the suppressive effects became stronger as the contrast for SRF stimulation increased. The contrast sensitivity of SRF suppression did not correlate with that of CRF responses. By independently controlling contrast of CRF and SRF stimuli, we studied whether SRF effects vary with CRF response magnitude. Increasing contrast for CRF stimulation caused an upward shift of the range of effective contrasts for SRF stimulation, indicating that a high contrast for SRF stimulation is required for suppressing strong responses to CRF stimulation at high contrasts. To assess the possible origin of the suppressive SRF effect on V1 neurons, we also investigated the contrast dependency of SRF effects in 28 neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results suggest that SRF effects obtained at the subcortical level strongly contribute to those in V1. Taken together, we conclude that along the thalamocortical projections, SRF modulation exhibits a gain-control mechanism that scales the suppressive SRF effect depending on the contrast for CRF stimulation. In addition, SRF effects can be facilitatory at low stimulus contrasts potentially due to the enlargement of the summation field.;"Osaka Univ, Lab Cognit & Behav Neurosci, Grad Sch Med, Osaka 5600043, Japan; Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA";"Osaka University; The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute";Sato, H (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Lab Cognit & Behav Neurosci, Grad Sch Med, Hlth & Sport Sci Bldg,Machikaneyama 1-17, Osaka 5600043, Japan.;sato@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp;Naito, Tomoyuki/AAV-4785-2021;;;;;;57;29;31;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

While some of these adjustments occur at specific stages, others may be inherited from earlier stages. How do adaptation effects cascade along the visual system? We measured spatially selective adaptation at two successive stages in the mouse visual system: visual thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). This form of adaptation affected both stages but in drastically different ways: in LGN it only changed response gain, while in V1 it also shifted spatial tuning away from the adaptor. These effects, however, are reconciled by a simple model whereby V1 neurons summate LGN inputs with a fixed, unadaptable weighting profile. These results indicate that adaptation effects cascade through the visual system, that this cascading can shape selectivity, and that the rules of integration from one stage to the next are not themselves adaptable.;"[Dhruv, Neel T.; Carandini, Matteo] UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England";"University of London; University College London";Dhruv, NT (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Ophthalmol, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.;n.dhruv@ucl.ac.uk;"Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021; Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008";"Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Dhruv, Neel/0000-0001-7112-8501";"Royal Society Newton International Fellowship; National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship; Wellcome Trust; European Research Council";"Royal Society Newton International Fellowship(Royal Society); National Science Foundation International Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC))";We thank Charu Reddy for outstanding technical support and Jeremy Freeman and Jonathan Pillow for providing code to fit the LNP model.

While the phenomenon of functional cortical reorganization is well established, it remains unknown whether in humans, functional reorganization results from changes in brain anatomy, or simply reflects an unmasking of already existing dormant synapses. In 20 subjects with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and 23 controls, we used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether SI reorganization was associated with changes in SI anatomy. SCI resulted in a significant SI reorganization, with the little finger representation moving medially toward the lower body representation (i.e., area of sensory loss). Furthermore, although SCI was associated with gray matter volume loss in the lower body representation, this loss was minimized as reorganization increased. That is, the greater the medial shift in little finger representation, the greater the gray matter preservation in the lower body representation. In addition, in the region of greatest SI reorganization (little finger), fractional anisotropy was correlated with SI reorganization. That is, as SI reorganization increased, the extent of aligned structures decreased. Finally, although thalamocortical fibers remained unchanged, the ease and direction of water movement within the little finger representation was altered, being directed more toward the midline in SCI subjects. These data show that SI reorganization following SCI is associated with changes in SI anatomy and provide compelling evidence that SI reorganization in humans results from the growth of new lateral connections, and not simply from the unmasking of already existing lateral connections.;"[Henderson, Luke A.; Gustin, Sylvia M.] Univ Sydney, Dept Anat & Histol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Gustin, Sylvia M.; Wrigley, Paul J.; Siddall, Philip J.] Univ Sydney, Royal N Shore Hosp, Div Kolling Inst Med Res, Pain Management Res Inst, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Macey, Paul M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA";"University of Sydney; Royal North Shore Hospital; University of Sydney; Kolling Institute of Medical Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles";Henderson, LA (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Anat & Histol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;lukeh@anatomy.usyd.edu.au;"Gustin, Sylvia M/H-9648-2018; Wrigley, Paul J/P-9048-2014; Macey, Paul M./B-5037-2008";"Gustin, Sylvia M/0000-0002-9613-9845; Wrigley, Paul J/0000-0003-0960-4102; Macey, Paul M./0000-0003-4093-7458; Henderson, Luke/0000-0002-1026-0151";New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research;New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research;This work was supported by grants awarded by the New South Wales Office for Science and Medical Research.

Preferred directions are influenced by visual cues as well as idiothetic self-motion cues derived from vestibular, proprioceptive, motor efferent copy, and command signals. To distinguish the relative importance of active locomotor signals, we compared HD cell response properties in 49 anterodorsal thalamic HD cells of six male Long-Evans rats during active displacements in a foraging task as well as during passive rotations. Since thalamic HD cells typically stop firing if the animals are tightly restrained, the rats were trained to remain immobile while drinking water distributed at intervals from a small reservoir at the center of a rotatable platform. The platform was rotated in a clockwise/counterclockwise oscillation to record directional responses in the stationary animals while the surrounding environmental cues remained stable. The peak rate of directional firing decreased by 27% on average during passive rotations (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). Individual cells recorded in sequential sessions (n = 8) reliably showed comparable reductions in peak firing, but simultaneously recorded cells did not necessarily produce identical responses. All of the HD cells maintained the same preferred directions during passive rotations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of locomotor activity provides a state-dependent modulation of the response magnitude of AD HD cells.

Voxelbased morphometry (VBM) was applied to magnetic resonance images of strabismic adults to detect any abnormal brain anatomy, which could not be easily identified by simple inspection. The gray matter volume in strabismic adults was smaller than that in normal subjects at the areas consistent with the occipital eye field (OEF) and parietal eye field (PEF). However, greater gray matter volume was found in strabismic adults relative to normal controls at the areas consistent with the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and subcortical regions such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. These opposite gray matter changes in the visual and the oculomotor processing areas are compatible with a hypothesis of plasticity in the oculomotor regions to compensate for the cortical deficits in the visual processing areas.

To what extent these interactions are present in the human brain remains unclear; however, these connections are thought to provide an important framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to the manifestation of basal ganglia disorders, especially with respect to tremor genesis in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested the feasibility of assessing these connections in vivo and non-invasively in the human brain with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography. After developing a standardized protocol for manual segmentation of basal ganglia and cerebellar structures, masks for diffusion tractography were defined based on structural magnetic resonance images. We tested intra- and inter-observer stability and carried out tractography for dentato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar projections. After robustly achieving connection probabilities per tract, the connectivity values and connectional fingerprints were calculated in a group of healthy volunteers. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was applicable to probe the inter-connection of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Our data confirmed that dentato-thalamo-striato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar connections also exist in the human brain at a level similar to those that were recently suggested by transneuronal tracing studies in non-human primates. Standardized segmentation protocols made these findings reproducible with high stability. We have demonstrated that diffusion tractography in humans in vivo is capable of revealing the structural bases of cerebellar networks with the basal ganglia. These findings support the role of the cerebellum as a satellite system of established cortico-basal ganglia networks in humans.";"[Pelzer, Esther Annegret; Hintzen, Andreas; Goldau, Mathias; von Cramon, Detlev Yves; Tittgemeyer, Marc] Max Planck Inst Neurol Res, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Pelzer, Esther Annegret; Timmermann, Lars] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Neurol, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Goldau, Mathias] Univ Leipzig, Inst Informat, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany";"Max Planck Society; University of Cologne; Leipzig University";Pelzer, EA (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Neurol, Kerpener Str 62, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.;esther.pelzer@uk-koeln.de;;Timmermann, Lars/0000-0002-5301-3580;German Research Foundation (DFG) in the Clinical Research Group 219 [KFO 219];German Research Foundation (DFG) in the Clinical Research Group 219(German Research Foundation (DFG));The authors wish to thank Jurgen K.

High-field functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was used to study the central processing of brief air-pulses, delivered to the peritonsillar region of the lateral oropharynx, in six healthy adults. Bilateral air-pulse stimulation was associated with the activation of a bilateral network including the primary somatosensory cortex and the thalamus, classic motor areas (primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, cingulate motor areas), and polymodal areas (including the insula and frontal cortex). These results suggest that oropharyngeal stimulation can activate a bilaterally distributed cortical network that overlaps cortical regions previously implicated in oral and pharyngeal sensorimotor functions such as tongue movement, mastication, and swallowing. The present study also demonstrates the utility of air-pulse stimulation in investigating oropharyngeal sensorimotor processing in functional brain imaging experiments.

The functional interactions between brain areas, including those observed during rest, are assumed to stem from the collective influence of action potentials carried by long-range neural projections. However, the contribution of individual neurons to brain-wide functional connectivity has not been systematically assessed. Here we developed a method to concurrently measure and compare the spiking activity of local neurons with fMRI signals measured across the brain during rest. We recorded spontaneous activity from neural populations in cortical face patches in the macaque during fMRI scanning sessions. Individual cells exhibited prominent, bilateral coupling with fMRI fluctuations in a restricted set of cortical areas inside and outside the face patch network, partially matching the pattern of known anatomical projections. Within each face patch population, a subset of neurons was positively coupled with the face patch network and another was negatively coupled. The same cells showed inverse correlations with distinct subcortical structures, most notably the lateral geniculate nucleus and brainstem neuromodulatory centers. Corresponding connectivity maps derived from fMRI seeds and local field potentials differed from the single unit maps, particularly in subcortical areas. Together, the results demonstrate that the spiking fluctuations of neurons are selectively coupled with discrete brain regions, with the coupling governed in part by anatomical network connections and in part by indirect neuromodulatory pathways.;"[Zaldivar, Daniel; Koyano, Kenji W.; Godlove, David C.; Park, Soo Hyun; Russ, Brian E.; Bhik-Ghanie, Rebecca; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)";"Zaldivar, D; Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.";"daniel.zaldivarperez@nih.gov; leopoldd@mail.nih.gov";"Koyano, Kenji/IQU-4144-2023; Zaldivar, Daniel/M-6729-2014";"Zaldivar, Daniel/0000-0002-6838-355X; Park, Soo Hyun/0000-0003-4645-457X; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360; Bhik-Ghanie, Rebecca/0000-0002-4262-7165; Koyano, Kenji/0000-0002-2160-1732";"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health [ZIAMH002838, ZIAMH002898, ZIAMH002899]; DFG [ZA990/1-]";"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))";We thank David Yu, Charles Zhu, and Katy Smith for their assistance during experiments.

Concurrent stimulation of many patches by means of the pseudorandom, binary m-sequence technique revealed interactions between their respective responses. An analysis identified two distinct components of local field potentials: a fast local component (FLC) and a slow distributed component (SDC). The FLC is thought to be a primarily postsynaptic response, as judged by its relatively short latency. It is directly generated by thalamocortical volleys following retinotopic stimulation of receptive fields of a small cluster of single cells, combined with responses to recurrent excitation and inhibition derived from the cells under study and immediately neighboring cells. In contrast, the SDC is thought to be an aggregate of dendritic potentials related to the long-range lateral connections (i.e. long-range coupling). We compared the suppressive effects of a GABA(A)-receptor agonist, muscimol, on the FLC and SDC with those of a GABA(B)-receptor agonist, baclofen, and found that muscimol more strongly suppressed the FLC than the SDC, and that the reverse was the case for baclofen. The differential suppression of the FLC and SDC found in the present study is consistent with the notion that intracortical electrical signals related to the FLC terminate on the somata and proximal/basal dendrites, while those related to the SDC terminate on distal dendrites.;Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA;The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute;Kasamatsu, T (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 2318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.;takuji@ski.org;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY-06883, EY-012413, EY-06861] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;73;10;10;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;NOV-DEC;2005;22;6;;;;;839;858;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523805226135;;;20;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";013FY;16469192;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000235396400012;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this present cross-sectional study, we aimed to search for neural networks with electroencephalography whose frequency-specific actions may predict bradykinesia. Methods: Twenty Parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation were first prescreened while we selected four levels of contralateral stimulation (0: OFF, 1-3: decreasing symptoms to ON state) individually, based on kinematics. In the screening period, we performed 64-channel electroencephalography measurements simultaneously with electromyography and motion detection during a resting state, finger tapping, hand grasping tasks, and pronation-supination of the arm, with the four levels of contralateral stimulation. We analyzed spectral power at the low (13-20 Hz) and high (21-30 Hz) beta frequency bands and low (31-60 Hz) and high (61-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands using the dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Structural equation modelling estimated causal relationships between the slope of changes in network beta and gamma activities and the slope of changes in bradykinesia measures. Results: Activity in different subnetworks, including predominantly the primary motor and premotor cortex, the subthalamic nucleus predicted the slopes in amplitude and speed while switching between stimulation levels. These subnetwork dynamics on their preferred frequencies predicted distinct types and parameters of the movement only on the contralateral side.

Auditory information is then distributed from the core areas to a surrounding belt of about seven areas that are less precisely cochleotopic and generally more responsive to complex stimuli than tones. Recent studies indicate that the belt areas relay to the rostral and caudal divisions of a parabelt region at a third level of processing in the cortex lateral to the belt. The parabelt and belt regions have additional inputs from dorsal and magnocellular divisions of the medial geniculate complex and other parts of the thalamus. The belt and parabelt regions appear to be concerned with integrative and associative functions involved in pattern perception and object recognition.

To assess the input mechanism underlying the surround suppression, we tested the effects of iontophoretically administered GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), for the 46 V1 neurons in anesthetized cats. First, the stimulus-size tuning curves were studied, with or without BMI administration, for each neuron by changing the size of the grating patch. During the BMI administration, the shape of the normalized size tuning curve did not change considerably. Second, the dependency of surround suppression on the orientation of the surround grating was examined. In the control, the surround suppression showed the clear orientation tuning that peaked at an orientation the same as the optimal orientation of the CRF response. The BMI administration did not change the orientation dependency of surround suppression. We also estimated the relative contribution of excitation and inhibition to the size and orientation tuning of surround suppression. It was concluded that cortical excitation and inhibition were well balanced, having similar tuning profiles for both stimulus size and orientation of the surround grating. Furthermore, surround stimuli used for V1 neurons suppressed the CRF response of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that surround suppression is not primarily attributable to the intracortical inhibition, but because of a reduction of thalamocortical inputs, which drive the cortical excitation and inhibition, and a subsequent decrease in the cortical excitatory interactions.;Osaka Univ, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan;Osaka University;Sato, H (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Sch Hlth & Sport Sci, 1-17 Machikaneyama, Osaka 5600043, Japan.;sato@vision.hss.osaka-u.ac.jp;Naito, Tomoyuki/AAV-4785-2021;;;;;;55;115;117;0;4;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Moreover, dopaminergic projections and D-1/D-5 receptor distributions display a layer-dependent organization, suggesting specific functions in the cortical circuitry. However, the circuit effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission in sensory cortex and their possible roles in perception, learning, and memory are largely unknown. Here, we investigated layer-specific circuit effects of dopaminergic neuromodulation using current source density (CSD) analysis in AI of Mongolian gerbils. Pharmacological stimulation of D1/D5 receptors increased auditory-evoked synaptic currents in infragranular layers, prolonging local thalamocortical input via positive feedback between infragranular output and granular input. Subsequently, dopamine promoted sustained cortical activation by prolonged recruitment of long-range corticocortical networks. A detailed circuit analysis combining layer-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), CSD analysis, and pharmacological cortical silencing revealed that cross-laminar feedback enhanced by dopamine relied on a positive, fast-acting recurrent corticoefferent loop, most likely relayed via local thalamic circuits. Behavioral signal detection analysis further showed that activation of corticoefferent output by infragranular ICMS, which mimicked auditory activation under dopaminergic influence, was most effective in eliciting a behaviorally detectable signal. Our results show that D-1/D-5-mediated dopaminergic modulation in sensory cortex regulates positive recurrent corticoefferent feedback, which enhances states of high, persistent activity in sensory cortex evoked by behaviorally relevant stimuli. In boosting horizontal network interactions, this potentially promotes the readout of task-related information from cortical synapses and improves behavioral stimulus detection.;"[Happel, Max F.

Rats in the pseudorandom group were exposed to pseudorandom presentations of the same tone, light and shock stimuli without consistent pairings, Untrained rats in a naive group did not receive presentations of the experimental stimuli. The findings demonstrated that auditory fear conditioning modifies the metabolic neuronal responses of the auditory system, supporting the hypothesis that sensory neurons are responsive to behavioural stimulus properties acquired by learning. There was a clear distinction between thalamocortical and lower divisions of the auditory system based on the differences in metabolic activity evoked by classical conditioning, which lead to an overt learned behavioural response versus pseudorandom stimulus presentations, which lead to behavioural habituation. Increases in cytochrome oxidase activity indicated that tone processing is enhanced during associative conditioning at upper auditory structures (medial geniculate nucleus and secondary auditory cortices). In contrast, metabolic activation of lower auditory structures (cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculus) in response to the pseudorandom presentation of the experimental stimuli suggest that these areas may be activated during habituation to tone stimuli.

However, recent studies have emphasized that such ongoing activity is strongly synchronized over large cortical distances, and can have a marked impact on the responsiveness of neurons to visual stimuli, suggesting that such activity may indeed be highly relevant to the brain's interpretation of its sensory input. In the current study, we examined the spatiotemporal nature of local field potential (LFP) fluctuations in the visual cortex of two macaque monkeys that were awake, but in a state of relaxation with minimal visual stimulation. Using an array of 16 electrodes spaced by several millimeters, we simultaneously monitored the LFP at many sites over a large region of the visual cortex. In agreement with the literature, we found that the coherence in the raw LFP signal fell off quickly with both frequency and distance. However, when we examined slower fluctuations in the LFP power, we found that. power signals, including those derived from the high gamma-range frequencies, had high coherence that fell off only very slowly with cortical distance. Finally, we performed an additional experiment, with several electrodes placed on either side of a sulcus, to demonstrate that the decline in local field synchrony with cortical distance was so reliable that the interruption in the cortical sheet corresponding to the opening of the sulcus could be easily identified by monitoring just a few minutes of spontaneous LFP activity. These experiments reveal that a significant portion of spontaneous LFP fluctuations in the visual cortex is contributed by global mechanisms, imposing synchrony that is, first and foremost, a function of cortical separation between any two points.;Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany;Max Planck Society;;;Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019;Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360;;;;;26;42;42;0;3;FREUND & PETTMAN PUBLISHERS;EAST YORKSHIRE;ENHOLMES HALL, PATRINGTON, EAST YORKSHIRE HU12 OPR, ENGLAND;0334-1763;;;REV NEUROSCIENCE;Rev.

The control of voluntary saccades to visual and remembered targets is modeled in terms of interactions between posterior parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, the basal ganglia (caudate and substantia nigra), superior colliculus, mediodorsal thalamus, and the saccade generator of the brainstem. Interactions include the modulation of eye movement motor error maps by topographic inhibitory projections, dynamic remapping of spatial target representations in saccade motor error maps, and sustained neural activity that embodies spatial memory.

The functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex implicated in vision is reviewed with the purpose of illustrating the complexity of the cortical processing in visual perception. Development.

Special attention is paid in showing the visual pathways for object and face recognition as well as spatial cognition. Conclusions. Visual cortical areas in primates and man can be divided roughly into a ventral stream in relation with the temporal lobe responsible for the processing and storage of information about the identity of objects, their shape, color, and other salient physical features; and a dorsal stream in relation with the parietal lobe and concerned with the analysis of the locations of objects, and their movements in space.

Little is known about the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), an area of the cortex with prominent vestibular inputs. Neural activity was recorded in the PIVC of rhesus macaques during combinations of head, body, and visual target rotations. Activity of many PIVC neurons was correlated with the motion of the head in space (vestibular), the twist of the neck (proprioceptive), and the motion of a visual target, but was not associated with eye movement. PIVC neurons responded most commonly to more than one stimulus, and responses to combined movements could often be approximated by a combination of the individual sensitivities to head, neck, and target motion. The pattern of visual, vestibular, and somatic sensitivities on PIVC neurons displayed a continuous range, with some cells strongly responding to one or two of the stimulus modalities while other cells responded to any type of motion equivalently. The PIVC contains multisensory convergence of self-motion cues with external visual object motion information, such that neurons do not represent a specific transformation of any one sensory input. Instead, the PIVC neuron population may define the movement of head, body, and external visual objects in space and relative to one another. This comparison of self and external movement is consistent with insular cortex functions related to monitoring and explains many disparate findings of previous studies.;"[Shinder, Michael E.; Newlands, Shawn D.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Otolaryngol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston";Newlands, SD (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 629, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;Shawn_newlands@urmc.rochester.edu;;;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC0006429, F31DC 007583];National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));This work was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (R01DC0006429 and F31DC 007583).;;83;37;37;0;11;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

This study examined the possibility that the TRN is involved in covert orienting of attention. Attention can be summoned to a spatial location in the absence of an overt orienting response. The reaction time to a visual target is faster when attention has been drawn to the location of the target by a preceding cue in that location (valid cue) compared with when the cue misdirects attention (invalid cue) away from the location of the subsequent target. This reaction time difference is referred to as the validity effect. Rats were trained to perform such a reaction time task with visual cues and targets presented in poke holes to either side of the rat's head, which had to be maintained centrally and still. If the rat made an overt orienting response to the cue, the trial was aborted. Unilateral lesions were made by injection of ibotenic acid in the TRN. After surgery, there was no bias apparent in their responding; they were as likely to initiate responses and were equally accurate to either side. There was, however, a complete abolition of the validity effect for responses to contralateral targets.

This paper explores these anatomic substrates, namely, the incorporation of the associative and paralimbic cerebral areas into the cerebrocerebellar circuitry in nonhuman primates. Using the novel information that has emerged concerning this system, proposed rules are derived and specific hypotheses offered concerning cerebellar function and the relationship between cerebellum and nonmotor behavior, as follow. (1) The associative and paralimbic incorporation into the cerebrocerebellar circuit is the anatomic underpinning of the cerebellar contribution to cognition and emotion. (2) There is topographic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions within the cerebellum. The archicerebellum, vermis, and fastigial nucleus are principally concerned with affective and autonomic regulation and emotionally relevant memory. The cerebellar hemispheres and dentate nucleus are concerned with executive, visual-spatial, language, and other mnemonic functions. (3) The convergence of inputs from multiple associative cerebral regions to common areas within the cerebellum facilitates cerebellar regulation of supramodal functions. (4) The cerebellar contribution to cognition is one of modulation rather than generation. Dysmetria of (or ataxic) thought and emotion are the clinical manifestations of a cerebellar lesion in the cognitive domain. (5) The cerebellum performs the same computations for associative and paralimbic functions as it does for the sensorimotor system. These proposed rules and the general and specific hypotheses offered in this paper are testable using functional neuroimaging techniques. Neuroanatomy and functional neuroimaging may thus be mutually advantageous in predicting and explaining new concepts of cerebellar function.

Comparisons of angry vs. neutral actions performed separately in the blind and intact visual hemifield showed in both cases increased activation in primary somatosensory, motor, and premotor cortices. Activations selective for intact hemifield presentation of angry compared with neutral actions were located subcortically in the right lateral geniculate nucleus and cortically in the superior temporal sulcus, prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and intraparietal sulcus. Activations specific for blind hemifield presentation of angry compared with neutral actions were found in the bilateral superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, amygdala, and right fusiform gyrus. Direct comparison of emotional modulation in the blind vs. intact visual hemifield revealed selective activity in the right superior colliculus and bilateral pulvinar for angry expressions, thereby showing a selective involvement of these subcortical structures in nonconscious visual emotion perception.;"[Van den Stock, Jan; Tamietto, Marco; de Gelder, Beatrice] Tilburg Univ, Cognit & Affect Neurosci Lab, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Van den Stock, Jan; de Gelder, Beatrice] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Brain & Emot Lab Leuven, Dept Neurosci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Tamietto, Marco] Univ Turin, Dept Psychol, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Sorger, Bettina] Maastricht Univ, Dept Neuropsychol, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Pichon, Swann] Univ Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Grezes, Julie] Ecole Normale Super, Cognit Neurosci Lab, Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, Dept Cognit Studies,U960, F-75005 Paris, France; [de Gelder, Beatrice] Harvard Univ, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA";"Tilburg University; KU Leuven; University of Turin; Maastricht University; University of Geneva; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";de Gelder, B (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Cognit & Affect Neurosci Lab, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;degelder@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu;"Grezes, julie/I-3012-2019; pichon, swann JA/M-2966-2014; Van den Stock, J./F-1906-2014; Grèzes, Julie/E-5060-2016";"Grezes, julie/0000-0002-5066-9154; pichon, swann JA/0000-0001-5697-702X; Van den Stock, J./0000-0001-5756-3195; Grèzes, Julie/0000-0002-5066-9154; Tamietto, Marco/0000-0002-8815-8499; Sorger, Bettina/0000-0003-1393-3144";"European Commission [FP6-2005-NEST-Path, Imp 043403-COBOL]; Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research Postdoctoral Veni [451-07-032]; Fondazione Carlo Molo, Turin, Italy";"European Commission(European Commission Joint Research Centre); Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen(FWO); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research Postdoctoral Veni; Fondazione Carlo Molo, Turin, Italy";B.d.G., S.P., and J.G. were supported by European Commission Communication with Emotional Body Language (COBOL) Grant FP6-2005-NEST-Path Imp 043403-COBOL.

Intracortical responses were analysed in two latency ranges: 0-50 ms and 50-150 ms after stimulus. In all patients, we recorded in the first 50 ms after stimulus two positive P14 and P20 potentials followed by a N30 negativity. In the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, the P20-N30 potentials showed a clear amplitude decrease from the outer to the inner aspect of the frontal lobe with minimal amplitudes in the pre-SMA. In the hemisphere ipsilateral to stimulus, P20 and N30 amplitudes were decreasing from mesial to lateral frontal cortex. In the 50-150 ms latency range, contacts implanted in the pre-SMA recorded a negative potential in the 60-70 ms latency range which, in five patients, was followed by a positive response peaking 80-110 ms after stimulus. These potentials were not picked up by more superficial contacts. We conclude that no early SEP is generated in pre-SMA in the first 50 ms after stimulation, while some potentials peaking in the 60-100 ms after stimulus are likely to originate from this cortical area. The latency of the pre-SMA responses recorded in our patients supports the hypothesis that the pre-SMA does not receive short-latency somatosensory inputs via direct thalamocortical projections. More probably the pre-SMA receives somatosensory inputs mediated by a polysynaptic transcortical transmission through functionally secondary motor and somatosensory areas.;"Hop Neurol, Funct Neurol & Epileptol Dept, F-69003 Lyon, France; Hop Neurol, Dept Funct Neurosurg, F-69003 Lyon, France";"CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon";Mauguiere, F (corresponding author), Hop Neurol, Funct Neurol & Epileptol Dept, 59 Blvd Pinel, F-69003 Lyon, France.;mauguier@cismsun.univ-lyon1.fr;"FROT, Maud/S-8930-2019; barba, carmen/K-4942-2016; Barba, Carmen/AAB-7162-2022; mauguiere, frederic a l/C-6383-2013";"FROT, Maud/0000-0002-7783-9256; barba, carmen/0000-0001-5445-5842; mauguiere, frederic a l/0000-0002-9150-8584; MAUGUIERE, Francois/0000-0003-4291-4727; GUENOT, Marc/0000-0003-1632-2138";;;;;68;44;44;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding(9), attention(11), stimulus discrimination(4), and motor behaviour(12). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood(2,3,13-20), and its coding implications are still debated(13,16,21,22). It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate- and- fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold- linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.;"NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; Univ Houston, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77204 USA";"New York University; New York University; University of Houston System; University of Houston";Doiron, B (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;"jrocha@cns.nyu.edu; bdoiron@cns.nyu.edu";de la Rocha, Jaime/I-2119-2015;de la Rocha, Jaime/0000-0002-3314-9384;;;;;30;470;473;3;66;NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;0028-0836;1476-4687;;NATURE;Nature;Aug 16;2007;448;7155;;;;;802;U6;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06028;;;6;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;200HJ;17700699;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000248754200039;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Spatially normalized images of FDOPA influx rate constant (Ki) values and relative regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rrCMRglc) were created. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) scores and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were used to determine the patients' cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Multiple correlation analyses between the FDOPA and FDG images and the cognitive and motor scores were performed for each voxel. Results: RCPM score was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the left hippocampus and with the rrCMRglc in the left middle frontal gyrus and right retrosplenial cortex. Motor function was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the bilateral striatum and with the rrCMRglc in association areas and primary visual cortex. The level of motor function was significantly inversely correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the anterior cingulate gyrus and with the rrCMRgle in bilateral primary motor cortex and right putamen. Conclusions: Changes of striatal FDOPA uptake and rrCMRglc in the primary motor cortex likely represent dysfunction in the motor system involving the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Change of FDOPA uptake in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be related to up-regulation of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopamine neurons. The regions where correlation with cognitive function was observed belong to a cognitive frontoparietal-hippocampal network.

We investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality contexts. Subjects underwent differential context conditioning in which they were repeatedly exposed to two contexts (CXT+ and CXT-) in semirandom order, with contexts counterbalanced across participants. An unsignaled footshock was consistently paired with the CXT+, and no shock was ever delivered in the CXT-. Evidence for context conditioning was established using skin conductance and anxiety ratings. Consistent with animal models centrally implicating the hippocampus and amygdala in a network supporting context conditioning, CXT+ compared with CXT-significantly activated right anterior hippocampus and bilateral amygdala. In addition, context conditioning was associated with activation in posterior orbitofrontal cortex, medial dorsal thalamus, anterior insula, subgenual anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and parietal cortices. Structural equation modeling was used to assess interactions among the core brain regions mediating context conditioning. The derived model indicated that medial amygdala was the source of key efferent and afferent connections including input from orbitofrontal cortex. These results provide evidence that similar brain mechanisms may underlie contextual fear conditioning across species.;"[Alvarez, Ruben P.; Biggs, Arter; Pine, Daniel S.; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Alvarez, RP (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, 15K North Dr,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;alvarezr@mail.nih.gov;Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019;;Intramural NIH HHS [Z99 MH999999] Funding Source: Medline;Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);;;66;234;236;3;39;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Enhanced haemodynamic responses during attentive conditions defined an occipitoparietofrontal system, including sensory and association areas, as well as the medial thalamus and superior colliculus. Attentional modulation was not restricted to extrastriate areas (including V3a and the V5 complex) but was also evident, to a lesser degree, in early visual areas close to the calcarine fissure (V1/V2 border), Attention-related enhancement of cortical responsiveness is discussed in terms of data that implicate modulatory short-term changes in synaptic efficacy and reciprocal connections between striate, extrastriate, parietal and frontal areas.

MAP 2-immunostained neurons are present through the depth of area 17 but are most intensely immunoreactive in layers IVB and VI. From layer IVB, separate groups of MAP 2-positive cells invade layers IVA and IVCalpha. Clusters of cells protrude upward from superficial layer IVB and occupy the central core regions of the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-stained honeycomb in layer IVA, while large neurons typical of layer IVB are distributed in irregular clusters in the subjacent layer IVCalpha. The somata in the layer IVA honeycomb cores give off immunostained dendrites which remain largely within the core regions. Patches of MAP 2-positive neurons are also present in layers II and III, where they coincide with the CO-stained puffs. Intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into one eye of adult monkeys produce stripes of alternating light and dark MAP 2 immunostaining in layer IVC. Stripes of light immunostaining coincide with stripes of light CO staining, and correspond to reduced MAP 2 immunoreactivity within cortical neurons dominated by the TTX-injected eye. In layers II and III, the MAP 2 immunostaining of patches overlying the injected-eye columns is similarly reduced. No change occurs in the MAP 2 immunostaining of layer IVA. These data suggest that the anatomical and physiological heterogeneity of layers IVA and IVCalpha arises from the periodic invasion of neurons characteristic of layer IVB, that the neurons in layer IVA have dendrites confined to thalamocortical-recipient or nonrecipient zones and that the expression of MAP 2 changes in adult cortical neurons following the loss of retinal input.;;;HENDRY, SHC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA.;;;;NIA NIH HHS [P50 AG054142] Funding Source: Medline;NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA));;;94;39;39;0;1;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;NOV;1992;9;5;;;;;445;459;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800011251;;;15;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";JU214;1333277;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1992JU21400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Attention seems to have a reciprocal relation with binding, inasmuch as the latter promotes the composition of features and their dependencies, while the former selects a single characteristic independently of the remainder. Classically, binding is viewed as a process whereby sets of properties are gathered in representative entities, which are themselves linked to form higher level structures, in a sequence that culminates in the total integration of the pattern features in a localized construct. The convergent axonal projections from one cortical area to another would be the neurobiological mechanism through which binding is achieved. Attention comprises the selective excitation of neuronal networks or pathways that stand for specific pattern properties. The thalamus and its reticular nucleus would then be the anatomical substrate of the attentional focus. In this paper we propose a computational model aiming at bringing together the main (and apparently diverging) ideas about binding and attention. Based on experimental data, a neuronal network representing cortical pyramidal cells is assembled, and its structure and function are related to the binding and attention phenomena. Actually, the convergent projections that enlarge the visual receptive field are associated to binding, while a specific change in the pyramidal cell behavior is responsible for attention. Computer simulations are shown which reproduce the electrophysiology of pyramidal cells and mimic some interesting experimental results in visual attention. We conclude by conjecturing that attention is a driven interruption in the regular process of binding.;"INST LOG FILOSOFIA & TEOR CIENCIA, BR-24030 NITEROI, RJ, BRAZIL; INST BRASILEIRO GEOG & ESTAT, BR-20941 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL";;DECARVALHO, LAV (corresponding author), FED UNIV RIO DE JANEIRO, COPPE, PROGRAMA ENGN SISTEMAS & COMP, CP 68511, BR-21945970 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.;;;;;;;;24;10;10;0;0;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0020-7101;;;INT J BIOMED COMPUT;Int.

A central problem in determining how visual information is processed is understanding how each of these RGC types connects to more central structures, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and (via the LGN) the primary visual cortex. Neverthelss, the available functional and anatomical evidence linking together specific cell types across these structures is surprisingly indirect. This review evaluates the available evidence and assesses the strength of the many inferences that can be made from these observations. There is strong evidence that parasol RGCs are the provenance of the magnocellular (M) visual pathway and that midget RGCs give rise to the parvocellular (P) pathway. Furthermore, the M and P pathways remain segregated up to the input layer of primary visual cortex. The relationships between the numerous other RGC types and cell types in the LGN remain less certain. and there remains ambiguity about how best to define additional pathways, such as the koniocellular (K) pathway, which probably arise from these other, less common, RGC types.;Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA;Salk Institute;Callaway, EM (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;callaway@salk.edu;Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011;Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267;;;;;37;147;149;0;27;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-3751;1469-7793;;J PHYSIOL-LONDON;J.

The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra- and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of Nurr1/Nr4a2, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.;"[Bruguier, Hannah; Hoerder-Suabedissen, Anna; Shelton, Andrew M.; Oliver, David K.; Packer, Adam M.; Molnar, Zoltan] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England; [Suarez, Rodrigo] Univ Queensland, Queensland Brain Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Manger, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anat Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ferran, Jose L.; Puelles, Luis] Univ Murcia, Sch Med, Dept Human Anat, Murcia, Spain; [Ferran, Jose L.; Puelles, Luis] Murcia Arrixaca Inst Biomed Res, Murcia, Spain; [Garcia-Moreno, Fernando] Achucarro Basque Ctr Neurosci, Zamudio, Spain; [Garcia-Moreno, Fernando] IKERBASQUE Fdn, Bilbao, Spain";"University of Oxford; University of Queensland; University of Witwatersrand; University of Murcia; Basque Foundation for Science";Molnar, Z (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford OX1 3QX, England.;zoltan.molnar@dpag.ox.ac.uk;"Ferran, Jose/H-6288-2011; Molnar, Zoltan/J-7281-2012";"Ferran, Jose/0000-0002-3413-9452; Molnar, Zoltan/0000-0002-6852-6004; Hoerder-Suabedissen, Anna/0000-0003-1953-7871; Packer, Adam/0000-0001-5884-794X; Suarez, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5153-5652; PUELLES, LUIS/0000-0002-9541-7073";"Human Frontier Science Program; Medical Research Council; Royal Society; Wellcome Trust; ARC [ARC-DP160103958, DE160101394]; Seneca Foundation [19904/GERM/15]; FEDER [PGC2018-098229-B-100, PGC2018-096173-A-100]; MICINN; Australian Research Council [DE160101394] Funding Source: Australian Research Council; BBSRC [BB/F003285/1, BB/I021833/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/N026039/1, G0700377, G0900901, G0300200] Funding Source: UKRI";"Human Frontier Science Program(Human Frontier Science Program); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); ARC(Australian Research Council); Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca); FEDER(Spanish Government); MICINN(Spanish Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";"Human Frontier Science Program; Medical Research Council; The Royal Society; Wellcome Trust; ARC, Grant/Award Numbers: ARC-DP160103958, DE160101394; Seneca Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 19904/GERM/15; FEDER, Grant/Award Numbers: PGC2018-098229-B-100, PGC2018-096173-A-100; MICINN";;146;26;26;2;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

We defined two cortical areas of activation in the operculo-insular cortex in response to a painful laser stimulation: a suprasylvian opercular area, where we recorded responses peaking 140-170 ms after a painful stimulation (N140-P170), and a deeper insular area, where responses with a similar pattern peaked 180-230 ms after the stimulus (N180-P230). The average delay of 50 ms measured between the opercular and insular responses may reflect either sequential activation of the suprasylvian cortex then of the insula via corticocortical connections, or direct activation of the insula by inputs conveyed via thalamocortical projections through distinct fibres with different conduction times. We also recorded similar insular and opercular responses in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation, peaking 15 ms later than contralateraI responses; this delay is compatible with transcallosal input transmission between these cortices. The mean stereotactic coordinates of the suprasylvian opercular N140-P170 and insular N180-P230 responses were found to be very similar to those of the maximal blood-flow responses to pain reported by previous PET and functional MRI studies in these cortical areas. We were able to distinguish the suprasylvian opercular and insular cortices in terms of response latencies evoked by a painful stimulus and in terms of stereotactic coordinates of the sources of these responses. The sequential timing of activation of the suprasylvian and insular cortices shown in this study thus complements in the time domain the spatial information provided by neuro-imaging studies of the cortical processing of pain.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 tesla (T), collective responses of neural populations in the LGN were measured as a function of stimulus contrast and flicker reversal rate and compared with those obtained in visual cortex. Flickering checkerboard stimuli presented in alternation to the right and left hemifields reliably activated the LGN. The peak of the LGN activation was found to be on average within +/-2 mm of the anatomical location of the LGN, as identified on high-resolution structural images. In all visual areas except the middle temporal (MT), fMRI responses increased monotonically with stimulus contrast. In the LGN, the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the cortex. Contrast sensitivity was lowest in the LGN and V1 and increased gradually in extrastriate cortex. In area MT, responses were saturated at 4% contrast. Response modulation by changes in flicker rate was similar in the LGN and V1 and occurred mainly in the frequency range between 0.5 and 7.5 Hz; in contrast, in extrastriate areas V4, V3A, and MT, responses were modulated mainly in the frequency range between 7.5 and 20 Hz. In the human pulvinar, no activations were obtained with the experimental designs used to probe response properties of the LGN. However, regions in the mediodorsal right and left pulvinar were found to be consistently activated by bilaterally presented flickering checkerboard stimuli, when subjects attended to the stimuli.

In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion.;"[Carriot, Jerome; Brooks, Jessica X.; Cullen, Kathleen E.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada";McGill University;Cullen, KE (corresponding author), McIntyre Med Res Bldg,Room 1219,3655 Prom Sir Wil, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.;kathleen.cullen@mcgill.ca;;;"CIHR; NIH; FRQNT";"CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); FRQNT";This study was supported by CIHR, NIH, and FRQNT.

Here we identify a pathway from the first synapse in the retina to koniocellular layer K1 in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Particle-mediated gene transfer of an expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP) was used to label excitatory synapses on retinal ganglion cells and combined with immunofluorescence to identify the presynaptic bipolar cells. We found that axon terminals of one type of diffuse bipolar cell (DB6) provide dominant synaptic input to the dendrites of narrow thorny ganglion cells. Retrograde tracer injections into the LGN and photofilling of retinal ganglion cells showed that narrow thorny cells were preferentially labeled when koniocellular layer K1 was targeted. Layer K1 contains cells with high sensitivity for rapid movement, and layer K1 sends projections to association visual areas as well as to primary visual cortex.

Our studies of vertical connections reveal a remarkable specificity in the laminar arrangement of the projections from layer IV to layer III that establishes three parallel intracortical pathways. The pathways that emerge from layer IV are not simple continuations of parallel thalamocortical pathways. Layer IV and its connections with layer II/III restructure the inputs from the LGN, combining the activity from ON and OFF channels and from the left and right eye and transmit the products of this synthesis to separate strata within the overlying layers. In addition, studies of two other prominent vertical connection pathways, the projections from layer VI to layer IV and from layer II/III to layer V suggest that the parallel nature of these systems is perpetuated throughout the cortical depth. Our studies of horizontal connections have revealed a systematic relationship between a neuron's orientation preference and the distribution of its axon arbor across the cortical map of visual space. Horizontal connections in layer II/III extend for greater distances and give rise to a greater number of terminals along an axis of the visual field map that corresponds to the neuron's preferred orientation. These findings suggest that the contribution of horizontal inputs to the response properties of layer II/III neurons is likely to be greater in regions of visual space that lie along the axis of preferred orientation (endzones) than along the orthogonal axis (side zones). Topographically aligned horizontal connections may contribute to the orientation preference of layer II/III neurons and could account for the axial specificity of some receptive field surround effects. Together, these results emphasize that specificity in the spatial arrangement of local circuit axon arbors plays an important role in shaping the response properties of neurons in visual cortex.;;;Fitzpatrick, D (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,MED CTR,DEPT NEUROBIOL,BOX 3209,DURHAM,NC 27710, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY06821, EY06661] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;77;165;165;1;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

We used functional MRI to investigate the neural representation of cross-modal matching between tactile and visual shape information in eleven normal volunteers. During the scan, patterns of 2D shapes were presented both tactually and visually, simultaneously. Four different matching tasks were performed: tactile-tactile with eyes closed (TT), tactile-tactile with visual input (TTv), visual-visual with tactile input (VVt), and tactile-visual (TV). The TT task activated the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, and the postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobules, anterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus, secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, dorsal premotor area, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area bilaterally, without occipital involvement. Visual matching activated the primary visual cortex and the lingual and fusiform gyri bilaterally. A cross-modal area was identified by subtracting TTv images from TV images, subtracting VVt images from TV images, and then determining common active areas. There was one discrete area that was active bilaterally; the posterior intraparietal sulcus close to the parieto-occipital sulcus. These data suggest that shape information from different sensory modalities may be integrated in the posterior intraparietal sulcus during tactile-visual matching tasks.

Unfortunately, this definition is not consistently used, and it obscures distinct connectional and functional systems within the orbital cortex. It is difficult to interpret data on the orbital cortex that do not take these different systems into account. Analysis of cortico-cortical connections between areas in the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex indicate two distinct networks in this region. One system, called the orbital network, involves most of the areas in the central orbital cortex. The other system, has been called the medial prefrontal network, though it is actually more complex, since it includes areas on the medial wall, in the medial orbital cortex, and in the posterolateral orbital cortex. Some areas in the medial orbital cortex are involved in both networks. Connections to other brain areas support the distinction between the networks. The orbital network receives several sensory inputs, from olfactory cortex, taste cortex, somatic sensory association cortex, and visual association cortex, and is connected with multisensory areas in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex. The medial network has outputs to the hypothalamus and brain stem and connects to a cortical circuit that includes the rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus and dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, the entorhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortex, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.;Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;pricej@wustl.edu;;;NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH070941] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;54;264;268;0;29;WILEY-BLACKWELL;MALDEN;COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA;0077-8923;;978-1-57331-683-5;ANN NY ACAD SCI;Ann.NY Acad.Sci.;;2007;1121;;;;;;54;71;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1401.008;;;18;"Behavioral Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry";"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Behavioral Sciences; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry";BHD18;17698999;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000252265300005;View Full Record in Web of Science

How is information from the cortex transmitted to the periphery? We used two parallel approaches to map simultaneously multiple pathways to determine if hypothalamic autonomic centres are a key link for orbitofrontal areas and medial prefrontal areas, which have been associated with emotional processes, as well as low-level spinal and brainstem autonomic structures. The latter innervate peripheral autonomic organs, whose activity is markedly increased during emotional arousal. Results: We first determined if pathways linking the orbitofrontal cortex with the hypothalamus overlapped with projection neurons directed to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, with the aid of neural tracers injected in these disparate structures. We found that axons from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices converged in the hypothalamus with neurons projecting to brainstem and spinal autonomic centers, linking the highest with the lowest levels of the neuraxis. Using a parallel approach, we injected bidirectional tracers in the lateral hypothalamic area, an autonomic center, to label simultaneously cortical pathways leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axons projecting to low-level brainstem and spinal autonomic centers. We found densely distributed projection neurons in medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axonal terminations in several brainstem structures and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, which innervate peripheral autonomic organs. We then provided direct evidence that axons from medial prefrontal cortex synapse with hypothalamic neurons, terminating as large boutons, comparable in size to the highly efficient thalamocortical system. The interlinked orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal areas and hypothalamic autonomic centers were also connected with the amygdala. Conclusions: Descending pathways from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, which are also linked with the amygdala, provide the means for speedy influence of the prefrontal cortex on the autonomic system, in processes underlying appreciation and expression of emotions.;"Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, NEPRC, Southborough, MA 01772 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;"barbas@bu.edu; sgsaha@bu.edu; REMPELCL@grinnell.edu; ttroy@med.unc.edu";anand, amit/A-7222-2009;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;;;;;69;265;271;0;3;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1471-2202;;;BMC NEUROSCI;BMC Neurosci.;Oct 10;2003;4;;;;;;;;25;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-4-25;;;12;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;742YJ;14536022;Green Published, gold;;;19.07.23;WOS:000186545500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Tightly packed Lyn-positive cells formed discrete multiple stripes crossing perpendicular to the rostral limb of the anterior commissure, and intense masses surrounding the caudal limb. In the thalamus, the habenula, anterodorsal nucleus and medial geniculate body, together with the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, had prominent reactive neuronal somata and dendrites in the neuropil. The lateral septal nucleus also had intense Lyn-positive neurons with overlapping dendritic fields. In addition, scattered neurons were evenly distributed throughout the striatum. The red, interpeduncular, auditory and trigeminal tract nuclei were intensely reactive. The cerebellar molecular layer was uniformly labeled except for a few isolated fiber bundles in the lowest part of this layer. The granule cells adjacent to the Purkinje cell layer appeared in reactive patches. In the spinal cord, the posteromarginal nucleus had intense labeling.

Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of 'medial' and 'orbital' networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory-visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to he critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.;Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Campus Box 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;pricej@thalamus.wustl.edu;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [DC00093] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;116;1921;1952;4;178;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus combined with a conventional tracer, we identified direct and polysynaptic pathways to two PPC areas, the rostral medial intraparietal area (MIP) and the ventral part of the lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) in macaque monkeys. We found that rostral MIP and LIPv receive ascending vestibular pathways, and putative efference copy inputs disynaptically from the medullary medial reticular formation (MRF) where reticulospinal pathways to neck and arm motoneurons originate. LIPv receives minor disynaptic vestibular inputs, and substantial projections from the head movement-related rostral MRF, consistent with head gain modulation of LIPv activity and a role in planning gaze shifts. Rostral MIP is the target of prominent disynaptic pathways from reaching- and head movement-related MRF domains, and major ascending vestibular pathways trisynaptically from both labyrinths, explaining prominent vestibular responses and discrimination between active and passive movements demonstrated in rostral MIP and in the neighboring ventral intraparietal area, which are heavily interconnected. The findings that rostral MIP (belonging to the 'parietal reach region'), receives vestibular inputs as directly as classical vestibular areas, via a parallel channel, and efference copy signals pathways from MRF reticulospinal domains that belong to reach and head movement networks have important implications for the understanding of the role of the PPC in updating body representations and internal models for online guidance of movement.;"[Ugolini, Gabriella; Prevosto, Vincent] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Paris Saclay Inst Neurosci UMR9197, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Prevosto, Vincent] Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Durham, NC USA; [Prevosto, Vincent] Duke Univ, Duke Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC USA; [Graf, Werner] Howard Univ, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington, DC 20059 USA";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Duke University; Howard University";Ugolini, G (corresponding author), Paris Saclay Inst Neurosci UMR9197, Bat 32 CNRS,1 Av Terrasse, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;gabriella.ugolini@inaf.cnrs-gif.fr;;Prevosto, Vincent/0000-0001-8803-5918;European Union Grant EU 5th FP [QLRT-2001-00151];European Union Grant EU 5th FP;European Union Grant EU 5th FP, Grant/Award Number: QLRT-2001-00151, EUROKINESIS;;146;3;3;1;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.

In primates, most of the retinal ganglion cells that project to the LGN belong to one of two classes, P and M, whose axons terminate in the parvocellular or magnocellular subdivisions of the LGN. These cell classes give rise to two channels that have been distinguished anatomically, physiologically and behaviourally1-3,16,17. The visual cortex also can be subdivided into two pathways, one specialized for motion processing and the other for colour and form information4. Several lines of indirect evidence have suggested a close correspondence between the subcortical and cortical pathways, such that the M channel provides input to the motion pathway and the P channel drives the colour/form pathway5-7. This hypothesis was tested directly by selectively inactivating either the magnocellular or parvocellular subdivision of the LGN and recording the effects on visual responses in the cortex. We have previously reported that, in accordance with the hypothesis, responses in the motion pathway in the cortex depend primarily on magnocellular LGN8.

It is involved in high order association functions that include the integration of emotion, behavior, and various sensory processes. To define the cyto- and chemo-architectonic organization of the human orbitofrontal cortex, we have used antibodies to the nonphosphorylated neurofilament triplet protein and to the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calretinin. Immunohistochemistry revealed labeling patterns corresponding to the cytoarchitecture defined by Nissl preparations. Neurofilament protein-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were located only in layers V-VI in the agranular posterior orbitofrontal cortex, whereas they were distributed in both layers III and V-VI in the anteromedial and anterolateral granular regions. The intermediate dysgranular portion of the orbitofrontal cortex represented a transition zone with a progressive decrease in layer III labeled pyramidal cell numbers posteriorly. The distribution of parvalbumin- and calretinin-immunoreactive interneurons was more homogeneous, although the posteromedial region and the cortex of the inferior rostral sulcus had slightly lower parvalbumin-positive neuron counts than the other orbitofrontal areas. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the neuropil exhibited a high degree of regional specialization in that it was consistently less intense in the cortex of the intermediate and posterior part of the gyrus rectus, whereas the other orbitofrontal areas had a very dense neuropil staining in layers III to V. Also, there was a dense plexus of parvalbumin-immunoreactive fibers restricted to layer I in the posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex, and patches of neuropil staining in layer III of the inferior rostral sulcus. These region-specific neuropil staining patterns may correspond to the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive thalamocortical projections to distinct domains of the orbitofrontal cortex. This regional parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex as defined by specific neuronal markers, may represent an anatomical substrate for the localization of the various functions attributed to this poorly understood cortical region.

Anatomical tracing studies in nonhuman primates reveal differences in connectivity across subregions of the OFC, but data on the connectivity of the human OFC remain limited. We applied meta-analytic connectivity modeling in order to examine which brain regions are most frequently coactivated with the medial and lateral portions of the OFC in published functional neuroimaging studies. The analysis revealed a clear divergence in the pattern of connectivity for the medial OFC (mOFC) and lateral OFC (lOFC) regions. The lOFC showed coactivations with a network of prefrontal regions and areas involved in cognitive functions including language and memory. In contrast, the mOFC showed connectivity with default mode, autonomic, and limbic regions. Convergent patterns of coactivations were observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. A small number of regions showed connectivity specific to the anterior or posterior sectors of the OFC. Task domains involving memory, semantic processing, face processing, and reward were additionally analyzed in order to identify the different patterns of OFC functional connectivity associated with specific cognitive and affective processes. These data provide a framework for understanding the human OFC's position within widespread functional networks.;"[Zald, David H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Zald, David H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychiat, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [McHugo, Maureen] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Ray, Kimberly L.; Laird, Angela R.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Res Imaging Inst, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Glahn, David C.] Yale Univ, Olin Neuropsychiat Res Ctr, Inst Living, Dept Psychiat, Hartford, CT USA; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 1, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Clin Neurosci & Med Psychol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Laird, Angela R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Phys, Miami, FL 33199 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; Yale University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; State University System of Florida; Florida International University";Zald, DH (corresponding author), PMB 407817,111,21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;david.zald@vanderbilt.edu;"Eickhoff, Simon B./K-2061-2013; Laird, Angela R/B-5800-2010";"Eickhoff, Simon B./0000-0001-6363-2759; Laird, Angela R/0000-0003-3379-8744; Ray, Kimberly/0000-0003-1302-2834";National Institute of Mental Health [5 RO1 MH074567-3, R01-MH084812];National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));This work was supported by awards #5 RO1 MH074567-3 and R01-MH084812 from the National Institute of Mental Health.;;80;105;112;0;31;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons were microiontophoretically injected with biotin-dextran or biocytin and their labeled axons were individually reconstructed from serial horizontal sections immunostained for calbindin-D28k to delineate striatal patch/matrix compartments. Reconstruction of >40 axons shows that all Cg3 corticofugal fibers, including corticothalamic axons from layer VI, course through the patch network in the rostromedial sector of the striatum. Corticostriatal projections arise from two types of layer V cells: (i) long-range corticofugal neurons, whose main axons reach the brainstem and/or spinal cord, and (ii) neurons arborizing into both striatum and claustrum, either ipsi-. contra- or bilaterally. The axons of these two types of neurons arborize profusely in striatal patches and only sparsely in the matrix. Layer VI neurons do not arborize in the striatum but target principally the thalamus. The same corticothalamic axon can innervate the anterior, rostral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These findings support the concept that no corticofugal fiber system exists that is solely devoted to the striatum. They also shed new light on how neural information from prelimbic cortex is conveyed to various subcortical limbic structures in the rat.;Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Neurobiol Lab, Beauport, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada;Laval University;Parent, A (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Ctr Rech, Neurobiol Lab, 2601 de la Canardiere, Beauport, PQ G1J 2G3, Canada.;;Levesque, Martin/F-3431-2011;;;;;;59;82;83;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Each strain was injected into the arm area of the primary motor cortex. One strain, HSV-1(McIntyre-B), was transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to project to the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., ventrolateral thalamus). In addition, second-order neurons were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate and interpositus) and in the globus pallidus (internal segment). This result supports the concept that the arm area of the primary motor cortex is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia output. In contrast, the other strain, HSV-1(H129), was transported transneuronally in the anterograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to receive input from the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., putamen, pontine nuclei). In addition, third-order neurons were labeled in the cerebellar cortex (granule and Golgi cells) and in the globus pallidus (largely the external segment). Our observations suggest that strain differences have an important impact on the direction of transneuronal transport of HSV-1.

This interplay may be critical for likelihood of developing depressive episodes, at least in a subgroup of sensitive individuals. The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) indexes central serotonergic tonus, which may be related to endogenous sex-steroid levels in the mentally healthy state even though this remains elusive. Here we evaluate if peripheral levels of estradiol and testosterone are associated with 5-HT4R binding as imaged by [C-11]SB207145 positron emission tomography in a group of 41 healthy men. We estimated global 5-HT4R binding using a latent variable model framework, which models shared correlation between 5-HT4R across multiple brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, posterior and anterior cingulate, thalamus, pallidostriatum and neocortex). We tested whether testosterone and estradiol predict global 5-HT4R, adjusting for age. We found that testosterone, but not estradiol, correlated negatively with global 5-HT4R levels (p = 0.02) suggesting that men with high levels of testosterone have higher cerebral serotonergic tonus. Our findings corroborate the link between sex hormone levels and serotonin signalling. Future longitudinal studies in clinical relevant populations are needed to elucidate the potential importance of testosterone in the pathophysiology of e.g. major depression and its treatment.

In this study, we used two rs-fMRI measures to investigate the changes in brain function activity in DYS and their correlations with dysphagia severity. MethodIn this study, a total of 22 patients with DYS were compared with 30 patients without dysphagia (non-DYS) and matched for baseline characteristics. Then, rs-fMRI scans were performed in both groups, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated in both groups. The two-sample t-test was used to compare ReHo and fALFF between the groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the correlations between the ReHo and fALFF of the abnormal brain regions and the scores of the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), the Standardized Bedside Swallowing Assessment (SSA), the Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS), and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). ResultsCompared with the non-DYS group, the DYS group showed decreased ReHo values in the left thalamus, the left parietal lobe, and the right temporal lobe and significantly decreased fALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. In the DYS group, the ReHo of the right temporal lobe was positively correlated with the SSA score and the PAS score (r = 0.704, p < 0.001 and r = 0.707, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with the VFSS score (r = -0.741, p < 0.001). The ReHo of the left parietal lobe was positively correlated with SSA and PAS (r = 0.621, p = 0.002 and r = 0.682, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with VFSS (r = -0.679, p = 0.001). ConclusionThe changes in the brain function activity of these regions are related to dysphagia severity.

The extrastriate area MT [V5 (hMT+) in humans] located in the 'dorsal pathway' of the primate brain is specialized in the processing of visual motion information. The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of V5 (hMT+) in the control of visually guided hand movements and to identify the corresponding cortex activation implicated in the visuomotor tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Eight human subjects performed visually guided hand movements, either continuously tracking a horizontally moving target or performing ballistic tracking movements of a cursor to an eccentric stationary target while fixating a central fixation cross. The tracking movements were back-projected onto the screen using a cursor which was moved by an MRI-compatible joystick. Both conditions activated area V5 (hMT+), right more than left, particularly during continuous tracking. In addition, a large-scale sensorimotor circuit which included sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum as well as a number of cortical areas along the intraparietal sulcus in both hemispheres were activated.

Early recordings suggested that the PBN transmitted a faithful representation of taste activity from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). However, its role assumed greater significance as its subnuclei were shown to deal with different aspects of taste, visceral sensations, hedonics, and conditioned aversions. The discovery of parallel projections from PBN to the thalamus and to ventral forebrain, and evidence that the former carried sensory information while the latter signaled hedonics, conferred on PBN a central role in guiding feeding. Thus, it was surprising to discover that the PBN is not a taste relay in primates. So arose a distinction between rodents, in which parallel processing of taste and hedonic information is the rule, and primates, where serial processing through the cortex precedes a hedonic assessment. Where does the integration of taste and hedonics occur, and how does this affect feeding? Neurons in both NTS and PBN of rodents are modified by changing physiological conditions. That altered activity parallels and perhaps directs the rodent's feeding behavior. Information from primate NTS implies no such modification. These interactions are reserved for orbitofrontal cortex and ventral forebrain. The implication is that in rodents, hindbrain alterations not only control the reflexes associated with taste, but also direct food selection through the PBN-ventral forebrain projections. In primates, the apparatus is in place for an independent cognitive analysis unaltered by physiological state, upon which a hedonic assessment is subsequently overlaid.;"[Scott, Thomas R.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Small, Dana M.] Yale Univ, John B Pierce Lab, New Haven, CT USA";"California State University System; San Diego State University; Yale University; The John B Pierce Laboratory, Inc";Scott, TR (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;tom.scott@sdsu.edu;;Small, Dana/0000-0001-7363-1100;;;;;34;30;30;0;8;BLACKWELL PUBLISHING;OXFORD;9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXEN, ENGLAND;0077-8923;;978-1-57331-738-2;ANN NY ACAD SCI;Ann.NY Acad.Sci.;;2009;1170;;;;;;372;377;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03906.x;;;6;"Behavioral Sciences; Cell Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Physiology";"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Behavioral Sciences; Cell Biology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology";BLL92;19686161;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000270495700066;View Full Record in Web of Science

The three principal cortical components of this network are located in the region of the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. We injected a retrogradely transported fluorescent dye into the frontal eye fields and another into the posterior parietal cortex of the monkey brain. Large numbers of neurons in the cingulate cortex were retrogradely labeled with each of the two fluorescent dyes. The two types of retrogradely labeled neurons were extensively intermingled, but neurons labeled with both tracers constituted less than 1 % of retrogradely labeled cingulate neurons. Other cortical areas that contained retrograde neuronal labeling included the premotor, lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, opercular, posterior parietal, lateral temporal, inferior temporal, parahippocampal, and insular regions. These areas contained neurons labeled with each of the two dyes but virtually no neurons labeled with both. In the thalamus, retrogradely labeled nuclei failed to display evidence of double labeling. The overlap between the two populations of retrogradely labeled neurons was far more extensive at the cortical than at the thalamic level. These observations show that cortical and thalamic projections to the frontal eye fields and posterior parietal cortex do not represent axonal collaterals of single neurons but originate from two distinct and partially overlapping populations of neurons.;"HARVARD UNIV,BETH ISRAEL HOSP,DEPT NEUROL,BEHAV NEUROL SECT,330 BROOKLINE AVE,BOSTON,MA 02215; BETH ISRAEL HOSP,BULLARD LAB,BOSTON,MA 02215; BETH ISRAEL HOSP,DENNY BROWN LAB,BOSTON,MA 02215; BETH ISRAEL HOSP,CHARLES A DANA RES INST,BOSTON,MA 02215";"Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center";;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS20285] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;47;168;170;1;5;AMER MEDICAL ASSOC;CHICAGO;515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610;0003-9942;;;ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO;Arch.

Computerized perimetry indicated a left visual field defect only although MRI and (18)FDG-PET scans showed abnormalities in both occipital lobes. The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.

Published studies of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) published between January 1, 2006 and March 1, 2018 comparing SCI patients with controls were collected by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Voxel-wise meta-analyses of GMV and WMV differences between SCI patients and controls were performed separately using seed-based d mapping. Twelve studies with 12 GMV data sets and 9 WMV data sets yielded a total of 466 individuals (190 SCI patients and 276 controls) who were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with controls, SCI patients showed GMV atrophy in sensorimotor system regions including the bilateral sensorimotor cortex (S1 and M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), paracentral gyrus, thalamus, and basal ganglia, as well as WMV loss in the corticospinal tract.GMV aberrancies were also demonstrated in brain regions responsible for cognition and emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the left insula. Additionally, GMV in both the bilateral S1 and the left SMA was positively correlated with the time span after the injury. In conclusion, anatomical atrophy in cortical-thalamic-spinal pathways suggested that SCIs may result in degenerative changes of the sensorimotor system. Further, OFC and insula GMV abnormalities may explain symptoms such as neuropathic pain and potential cognitive-emotional impairments in chronic SCI patients. These findings indicate that anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols could be neuroimaging biomarkers for interventional studies and treatments.;"[Wang, Wenzhao; Chen, Jianan; Li, Hongfei; Su, Yanlin; Ning, Bin] Shandong Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenzhao] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shi] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Radiol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Cong] Shandong Univ, Qilu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China";"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Shandong University";Ning, B (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, 105 Jiefang Rd, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China.;ningbin@sdu.edu.cn;TANG, Shi/GXH-5719-2022;Wang, Wenzhao/0000-0001-5106-4862;"National Natural Science Funds of China [81401014, 81771346]; Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561935, 2015T80725]";"National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)";We are grateful to Dr. Steven C.

While it is known that primates have a complex array of 10 or more somatosensory areas that contribute to the analysis of sensory information from the hand, less is known about what cortical areas are involved in processing information from receptors of the tongue and teeth. The tongue contains taste receptors, as well as mechanoreceptors. Afferents from taste receptors and mechanoreceptors of the tongue access different ascending systems in the brainstem. However, it is uncertain how these two sources of information are processed in cortex. Here the parts of somatosensory areas 3b, 3a, and presumptive 1 that represent the mechanoreceptors of the teeth and tongue are identified, and evidence is presented that the representations of the tongue also get information from the taste nucleus of the thalamus, VPMpc. As areas 3b, 3a, and 1 project to other areas of somatosensory cortex, and those areas to additional areas, some or all of the currently defined somatosensory areas of cortex may be involved in processing gustatory, as well as tactile, information from the tongue and thus have a role in the biologically important function of evaluating food in the mouth.

One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our in silico model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.;"[Beul, Sarah F.; Goulas, Alexandros; Hilgetag, Claus C.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Computat Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany; [Hilgetag, Claus C.] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA";"University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Boston University";Beul, SF (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Computat Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany.;s.beul@uke.de;;Goulas, Alexandros/0000-0002-5381-0096;"German Research Council DFG [SFB 936, TRR169, SPP2041/HI1286/7-1]; Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation";"German Research Council DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)";"This work was supported by the German Research Council DFG (SFB 936/A1, Z3 (CCH); TRR169/A2 (CCH); SPP2041/HI1286/7-1 (CCH); http://www.dfg.de/), the Human Brain Project (HBP/SP2 (CCH); https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/) as well as the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AG; https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.";;135;17;17;0;0;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1553-734X;1553-7358;;PLOS COMPUT BIOL;PLoS Comput.

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus is the source of visual signals to the primary visual cortex (V1). Most large-scale cortical network models approximate the spike trains of LGN neurons as simple Poisson point processes. However, many studies have shown that neurons in the early visual pathway are capable of spiking with high temporal precision and their discharges are not Poisson-like. To gain an understanding of how response variability in the LGN influences the behavior of V1, we study response properties of model V1 neurons that receive purely feedforward inputs from LGN cells modeled either as noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) neurons or as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We first demonstrate that the NLIF model is capable of reproducing many experimentally observed statistical properties of LGN neurons. Then we show that a V1 model in which the LGN input to a V1 neuron is modeled as a group of NLIF neurons produces higher orientation selectivity than the one with Poisson LGN input. The second result implies that statistical characteristics of LGN spike trains are important for V1's function. We conclude that physiologically motivated models of V1 need to include more realistic LGN spike trains that are less noisy than inhomogeneous Poisson processes.;"[Lin, I-Chun; Xing, Dajun; Shapley, Robert] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA";New York University;Lin, IC (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;"icl231@nyu.edu; xdj@cns.nyu.edu; shapley@cns.nyu.edu";"Xing, Dajun/F-4217-2011; Lin, I-Chun/A-7010-2009";;"National Institutes of Health; National Science Foundation; Swartz Foundation";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swartz Foundation";We thank E.

Only 5-10% of the inputs to geniculate relay cells derive from retina, which is the driving input. The rest, being modulatory, derive from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from visual cortex, and ascending inputs from brainstem. The nonretinal, modulatory inputs, which form the vast majority, dynamically control the nature of the geniculate relay. Among other actions, these modulatory inputs regulate membrane properties of relay cells and thereby control their mode of response to retinal inputs, and this dramatically affects the nature of information relayed to cortex. Our studies of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat lead to the speculation that this dynamic control depends on the animal's behavioral state and represents the neuronal substrate for many forms of visual attention. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to cortex for the first time. In contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar (and lateral posterior nucleus in carnivores), is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it seems to relay information from one cortical area to another. Much more corticocortical processing may involve these 're-entry' routes than has been hitherto appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for corticocortical processing.;SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Physiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY11409, EY03038] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;61;37;37;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-50586-5;PROG BRAIN RES;;;2001;134;;;;;;51;69;;;;;;19;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";BV10B;11702563;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000177817400004;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is now clear that higher primates have four strip-like representations of skin and muscle receptors corresponding to areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2 of anterior parietal cortex. Areas 3 b and 1 receive cutaneous information from the ventroposterior nucleus, while a ventroposterior superior nucleus provides areas 3 a and 2 with information from muscle receptors. Area 3 b is the homolog of S-I in prosimians and non-primates and it provides most of the activating cutaneous inputs to areas 1 and 2. Most of the further processing that allows tactile recognition of objects involves somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus, where both S-II and the parietal ventral area (PV) receive activating inputs from areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2. S-II also projects to PV and to a parietal rostral area where further connections with the amygdala and hippocampus may occur to allow the formation of tactile memories. Areas of anterior parietal cortex also project to posterior parietal cortex, where regions of cortex are largely somatosensory, but the functional subdivisions remain uncertain. All of the somatosensory fields have access to motor areas of the frontal lobe, but the magnitude and targets of the projections differ.;;;KAAS, JH (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,111 21ST AVE SO,301 WILSON HALL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240, USA.;;;;;;;;94;102;103;0;1;GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG;JENA;VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY;0940-9602;;;ANN ANAT;Ann.

However, recent evidence in non-human primates, along with some evidence in humans with damaged primary visual cortex (e.g., blindsight for motion in the blind visual hemifield), have argued for the existence of a direct thalamic-to-extrastriate projection for motion processing. This evidence remains controversial. Here we tested the idea that direct thalamic input to extrastriate motion processing areas exists in humans but might be masked in scalp recordings by activity from early visual areas. To do this, we employed stimuli that induced strong refractory effects in primary visual cortex-thereby creating a brief reversable lesion in primary visual cortex-immediately before the presentation of a motion stimulus. Under these conditions, we then assessed whether motion areas of cortex were still able to process the motion stimuli by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related magnetic fields (ERFs/MEG). We found robust motion-related activity in extrastriate motion processing areas in the ERP and MEG signals even when primary visual cortex was heavily suppressed by our manipulation. This finding provides evidence for a direct thalamic functional pathway to extrastriate visual cortical motion processing areas in the human that bypasses primary visual cortex.

Data were obtained for three object weights (4, 200 and 600 g) and a resting condition. Grip and lift forces on a similar object and the activity of selected;muscles in the hand, arm and shoulder were also recorded in separate lifting trials. A comparison between all movement conditions and the resting condition revealed significant activation of the primary motor (M1), primary sensory (S1), dorso-caudal premotor (PM), caudal supplementary motor (SMA) and cingulate motor (CMA) cortices contralateral to the hand used. On the ipsilateral side. activation of the M1, caudal SMA and inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) was also found. In the subcortical areas, the bilateral hemispheres and right vermis of the cerebellum, left basal ganglia and thalamus were activated. Behavioral adaptation to a heavier object weight was revealed in a nearly proportional increase of both grip and lift forces, prolonged force application period and a higher level of hand and arm muscle activities. An increase in the rCBF associated with these changes was noted in several cortical and subcortical areas. However, consistent object weight-dependent activation was observed only in the M1/S1 contralateral to the hand used. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In addition, a small and heterogeneous collection of ganglion cell axons projects to the koniocellular layers of the LGN, to the superior colliculus (SC), and to other subcortical targets. The functional (receptive field) properties and target specificity of these non-parvocellular, non-magnocellular populations remain poorly understood. It is known that one population of koniocellular layer cells in the LGN (blue-On cells) receives dominant functional input from short-wavelength sensitive (S or 'blue') cones. Here we asked whether SC neurones also receive S cone inputs. We made extracellular recordings from single neurones (n = 38) in the SC of anaesthetised marmoset monkeys. Responses to drifting and flashed gratings providing defined levels of cone contrast were measured. The SC receptive fields we recorded were often binocular, showed 'complex cell' like responses (On-Off responses), strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, direction selectivity, and many showed strong and rapid habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli. We found no evidence for dominant S cone input to any SC neurone recorded. These data suggest that S cone signals may reach cortical pathways for colour vision exclusively through the koniocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus.;"[Tailby, Chris; Cheong, Soon Keen; Pietersen, Alexander N.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia; [Tailby, Chris; Solomon, Samuel G.] Florey Neurosci Inst Austin, Brain Res Inst, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia; [Cheong, Soon Keen; Pietersen, Alexander N.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia; [Solomon, Samuel G.; Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Physiol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";"University of Sydney; Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of Sydney; University of Sydney";Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst C09, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;prmartin@sydney.edu.au;"Solomon, Samuel G/C-8779-2009; Tailby, Chris/C-2801-2013; Tailby, Chris JD/K-4096-2015; Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009";"Tailby, Chris JD/0000-0002-1320-5924; Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Solomon, Samuel/0000-0001-5321-0288";"Australian NHMRC grant [1027913]; Australian Research Council grant [CE0561903]";"Australian NHMRC grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council grant(Australian Research Council)";We thank B.

In the same animals, neuroanatomical tracers were placed into electrophysiologically identified sites in PV and/or the second somatosensory area (S2). Foci of anterograde and retrograde label were related to electrophysiological maps of cortical areas and cortical and thalamic architecture. The results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Multiunit recordings from cortex on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus demonstrate that PV is somatotopically organized, with the face representation adjoining area 3b and the hindlimb and tail representations away from this border in cortex deep on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus. The forelimb representation is caudal in PV adjacent to the S2 forelimb representation. The body surface representation in PV approximates a mirror image of that in S2; (2) Areas PV and S2 are less myelinated and have less cytochrome oxidase enzyme activity than area 3b; (3) The ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI) of the thalamus provides the major somatosensory projections to PV. PV is reciprocally connected with VPI and anterior pulvinar; (4) PV has ipsilateral cortical connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, and M1 and higher order somatosensory fields, and at least most of these connections are somatotopically matched; and (5) Callosal connections of PV are with S2 and PV of the other cerebral hemisphere.

One prevalent hypothesis to account for this discrepancy is that posterior cingulate hypometabolism results from disconnection from the hippocampus through disruption of the cingulum bundle. However, only partial and indirect evidence currently supports this hypothesis. Thus, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 18 patients with early AD, we assessed the relationships between hippocampal atrophy, white matter integrity, and gray matter metabolism by means of a whole-brain voxel-based correlative approach. We found that hippocampal atrophy is specifically related to cingulum bundle disruption, which is in turn highly correlated to hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex but also of the middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (all part of Papez's circuit), as well as the right temporoparietal associative cortex. These results provide the first direct evidence supporting the disconnection hypothesis as a major factor contributing to the early posterior hypometabolism in AD. Disruption of the cingulum bundle also appears to relate to hypometabolism in a large connected network over and above the posterior cingulate cortex, encompassing the whole memory circuit of Papez (consistent with the key location of this white matter tract within this loop) and also, but indirectly, the right posterior association cortex.;"[Viader, Fausto; de la Sayette, Vincent] CHU Cote Nacre, Dept Neurol, F-14033 Caen, France; [Baron, Jean-Claude] Univ Cambridge, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Unit, Cambridge CB2 2SP, England; [Villain, Nicolas; Desgranges, Beatrice; Viader, Fausto; de la Sayette, Vincent; Mezenge, Florence; Landeau, Brigitte; Eustache, Francis; Chetelat, Gael] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CHU Cote Nacre, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Groupement Interet Publ Cyceron,INSERM,Unite U923, F-14074 Caen, France";"CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Universite de Caen Normandie; University of Cambridge; CHU de Caen NORMANDIE; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Caen Normandie";Chetelat, G (corresponding author), Univ Caen Basse Normandie, CHU Cote Nacre, Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Groupement Interet Publ Cyceron,INSERM,Unite U923, Blvd H Becquerel,BP 5229, F-14074 Caen, France.;chetelat@cyceron.fr;"DESGRANGES, BEATRICE/AAK-4756-2021; Desgranges, Béatrice/L-7739-2015; Kennedy, Kristen M/B-4699-2008; de la Sayette, Vincent/L-8074-2015; Villain, Nicolas/E-6475-2012; Chetelat, Gael/G-2316-2015; Eustache, Francis/J-9465-2015";"DESGRANGES, BEATRICE/0000-0002-3657-9996; Kennedy, Kristen M/0000-0001-5373-9026; Villain, Nicolas/0000-0002-7429-4289; Eustache, Francis/0000-0003-4460-8686; Gael, Chetelat/0000-0002-4889-7932; baron, claude/0000-0001-9573-7002; baron, jean-claude/0000-0002-5264-2588";;;;;63;282;287;1;34;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Their precise location, however, remains in dispute. For example, taste stimulation activates areas throughout the insula and overlying operculum, but identification of subregions has been inconsistent. Furthermore, literature reviews and summaries of gustatory brain activations tend to reiterate rather than resolve this ambiguity. Here, we used a new meta-analytic method [activation likelihood estimation (ALE)] to obtain a probability map of the location of gustatory brain activation across 15 studies. The map of activation likelihood values can also serve as a source of independent coordinates for future region-of-interest analyses. We observed significant cortical activation probabilities in: bilateral anterior insula and overlying frontal operculum, bilateral mid dorsal insula and overlying Rolandic operculum, and bilateral posterior insula/parietal operculum/postcentral gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right medial OFC, pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex (prACC) and right mediodorsal thalamus. This analysis confirms the involvement of multiple cortical areas within insula and overlying operculum in gustatory processing and provides a functional tastemap which can be used as an inclusive mask in the data analyses of future studies. In light of this new analysis, we discuss human central processing of gustatory stimuli and identify topics where increased research effort is warranted. Hum Brain Mapp 32:2256-2266, 2011.

In order to begin to understand the cellular interactions that are important in cortical target selection by thalamic axons, we have examined the morphology of axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as they navigate their way to the primary visual cortex. The morphology of geniculocortical axons was revealed by placing the lipophilic tracer Dil into the LGN of paraformaldehyde-fixed brains from fetal and neonatal cats between embryonic day 26 (E26; gestation is 65 d) and postnatal day 7 (P7). This morphological approach has led to three major observations. (1) As LGN axons grow within the intermediate zone of the telencephalon toward future visual cortex (E30-40), many give off distinct interstitial axon collaterals that penetrate the subplate of nonvisual cortical areas. These collaterals are transient and are not seen postnatally. (2) There is a prolonged period during which LGN axons are restricted to the visual subplate prior to their ingrowth into the cortical plate; the first LGN axons arrive within visual subplate by E36 but are not detected in layer 6 of visual cortex until about E50. (3) Within the visual subplate, LGN axons extend widespread terminal branches. This represents a marked change in their morphology from the simple growth cones present earlier as LGN axons navigate en route to visual cortex. The presence of interstitial collaterals suggests that there may be ongoing interactions between LGN axons and subplate neurons along the entire intracortical route traversed by the axons. From the extensive branching of LGN axons within the visual subplate during the waiting period, it appears that they are not simply ''waiting.'' Rather, LGN axons may participate in dynamic cellular interactions within the subplate long before they contact their ultimate target neurons in layer 4. These observations confirm the existence of a prolonged waiting period in the development of thalamocortical connections and provide important morphological evidence in support of the previous suggestion that interactions between thalamic axons and subplate neurons are necessary for cortical target selection.";STANFORD UNIV, MED CTR, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROBIOL, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA;Stanford University;;;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY02858] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD07249] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))";;;63;197;198;0;1;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

An algorithm for subdivision of the cerebral central white matter according to topographic criteria is developed in the companion manuscript. In the present paper we provide a rationale for this system of parcellation of the central white matter and we extend the system of cerebral parcellation to include principal subcortical gray structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. The volumetric measures of the subcortical gray and white matter parcellation units in 20 young adult brains are computed and reported here as well. In addition, with the comprehensive system for cerebral gray and white matter structure parcellation as reference, we formulate a systematics of forebrain connectivity. The degree to which functionally specific brain areas correspond to topographically specific areas is an open empirical issue. The resolution of this issue requires the development of topographically specific anatomic analyses, such as presented in the current system, and the application of such systems to a comprehensive set of functional-anatomic correlation studies in order to establish the degree of structural-functional correspondence. This system is expected to be applied in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience as an MRI-based topographic systematics of human forebrain anatomy with normative volumetric reference and also as a system of reference for the anatomic organization of specific neural systems as disrupted by focal lesions in lesion-deficit correlations.

Structural magnetic resonance studies indicate that brain abnormalities are present at onset, but longitudinal studies to assess neuroprogression have been limited by small samples and short or infrequent follow-up intervals. Methods: The Iowa Longitudinal Study is a prospective study of 542 first-episode patients who have been followed up to 18 years. In this report, we focus on those patients (n = 202) and control subjects (n = 125) for whom we have adequate structural magnetic resonance data (n = 952 scans) to provide a relatively definitive determination of whether progressive brain change occurs over a time interval of up to 15 years after intake. Results: A repeated-measures analysis showed significant age-by-group interaction main effects that represent a significant decrease in multiple gray matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, thalamus), multiple white matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, temporal, parietal), and a corresponding increase in cerebrospinal fluid (lateral ventricles and frontal, temporal, and parietal sulci). These changes were most severe during the early years after onset. They occur at severe levels only in a subset of patients. They are correlated with cognitive impairment but only weakly with other clinical measures. Conclusions: Progressive brain change occurs in schizophrenia, affects both gray matter and white matter, is most severe during the early stages of the illness, and occurs only in a subset of patients. Measuring severity of progressive brain change offers a promising new avenue for phenotype definition in genetic studies of schizophrenia.;[Andreasen, Nancy C.] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Carver Coll Med, Psychiat Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA;University of Iowa;Andreasen, NC (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Carver Coll Med, Psychiat Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium, 200 Hawkins Dr,Room W278 GH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;luann-godlove@uiowa.edu;Ho, Beng-Choon/D-6959-2011;"Ho, Beng-Choon/0000-0003-3976-1555; Nopoulos, Peggy/0000-0001-8810-1903; Magnotta, Vincent/0000-0001-8639-5354; Andreasen, Nancy/0000-0001-5730-9744";"Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses [MH43271]; Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia [5R01MH031593]; Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses [5R01MH040856]; Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging; Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis [5R01NS050568]; National Institutes of Health [MH68380]; National Association for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression";"Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses; Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses; Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging; Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Association for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression";"This article was written with support from the following Grants: Mental Health Clinical Research Center: Neurobiology and Phenomenology of the Major Psychoses (MH43271); Phenomenology and the Classification of Schizophrenia (5R01MH031593); Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Major Psychoses (5R01MH040856); Training in the Neurobiology of Schizophrenia and Evaluation with diffusion tensor imaging (Magnotta K Award); and Brain research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems Morphology and Image Analysis (5R01NS050568).

We previously found a substantial 25% reduction in neuron number of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17, BA17) in postmortem tissue from subjects with schizophrenia. Also, many studies have found reduced volume and neuron number of the pulvinar-the large thalamic association nucleus involved in higher-order visual processing. Here, we investigate if the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the visual relay nucleus of the thalamus, has structural changes in schizophrenia. We used stereological methods based on unbiased principles of sampling (Cavalieri's principle and the optical fractionator) to estimate the total volume and neuron number of the magno- and parovocellular parts of the left LGN in postmortem brains from nine subjects with schizophrenia, seven matched normal comparison subjects and 13 subjects with mood disorders. No significant schizophrenia-related structural differences in volume or neuron number of the left LGN or its major subregions were found, but we did observe a significantly increased total volume of the LGN, and of the parvocellular lamina and interlaminar regions, in the mood group. These findings do not support the hypothesis that subjects with schizophrenia have structural changes in the LGN. Therefore, our previous observation of a schizophrenia-related reduction of the primary visual cortex is probably not secondary to a reduction in the LGN.;"[Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Psychiat Res, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark; [Zhang, Wei; Sampson, Allan R.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Stat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Lewis, David A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Caric, Damira] Allegheny Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15212 USA; [Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton; Caric, Damira; Saghafi, Ramin; Lewis, David A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";"Aarhus University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Allegheny General Hospital; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Dorph-Petersen, KA (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Psychiat Res, Skovagervej 2, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark.;Karl-Anton@Dorph-Petersen.dk;"Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton/A-9039-2015; Lewis, David A/G-4053-2014";"Dorph-Petersen, Karl-Anton/0000-0002-6676-034X; Lewis, David A/0000-0002-3225-6778";National Institute of Mental Health [MH43784, MH45156];National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));The project described was supported by Grants Numbers MH43784 and MH45156 from the National Institute of Mental Health.

[C-11](R)-MeQAA binding was analyzed by a simplified reference tissue model to calculate nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), [C-11]PIB uptake was calculated by standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), and [F-18]BCPP-EF binding was determined by Logan graphical analysis to calculate total distribution volume (V-T) with arterial blood sampling. Higher brain uptake was determined in the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and cortical regions for [C-11](R)-MeQAA, while being lower in the cerebellum. Significant age-related reduction of [C-11](R)-MeQAA binding to 7-nAChR was determined only in the occipital cortex. The plot of Vt of [F-18]BCPP-EF against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA indicated a significant negative correlation in the hippocampus and cortical regions in aged animals. Plotting of SUVR of [C-11]PIB against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA showed a positive correlation.

Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear-related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the medial prefrontal network, is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex. The overall function of this circuit is unclear, but may be involved in introspective monitoring of the individual.;Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;pricej@wustl.edu;Winwood, Peter/A-6363-2008;;;;;;66;107;108;0;25;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

This estimate was based on the F-18-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measured by means of positron emission tomography and compared, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), with that of six control subjects. The contrast [CH children - Controls] showed that CH children had two loci of relatively higher FDG uptake. The larger voxel cluster was found in the ipsilesional hemisphere and comprised the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and left inferior parietal lobule. The other cluster was located in the contralesional hemisphere and encompassed the primary motor cortex, callosomarginal sulcus, and cingulate gyrus. The reverse contrast [Controls - CH children] showed that control subjects had a relatively higher FDG uptake bilaterally in the temporal and hippocampal gyri, the rostral part of the brain stem, the thalami, the putamen, and the superior frontal gyri. A crossed cerebellar diaschisis was not observed in CH children. This relatively higher FDG uptake in the ipsi- and contralesional motor areas of CH children stands out in contrast to the hypometabolism (diaschisis) frequently observed in adult stroke patients with a subcortical lesion. This increased FDG uptake in the disconnected ipsilesional motor areas may reflect a long-term adaptation leading, for example, to an increased synaptic density and/or activity or to a change in the density of glucose transporters.

However, whether different aspects of sequential information like interval and ordinal properties are supported by different anatomical regions, and whether the representation of sequential information within the PMC is necessarily related to motor requirements, remain open questions. Brain activations were investigated during a sequence encoding paradigm in 12 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects had to attend either to the interval or to the ordinal information of a sequence of visually presented stimuli and had to encode the relevant information either before motor reproduction or before perceptual monitoring. Although interval and ordinal information led to activations within the same neural network, direct comparisons revealed significant differences. The pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), the lateral PMC, the frontal opercular cortex as well as basal ganglia and the left lateral cerebellar cortex (CE) were activated significantly more strongly by interval information, whereas the SMA, the frontal eye field, the primary motor cortex (MI), the primary somatosensory cortex, the cuneus as well as the medial CE and the thalamus were activated more strongly by ordinal information, In addition, serial encoding before reproduction led to higher activations than serial encoding before monitoring in the preSMA, SMA, MI and medial CE.

Three animals were analyzed. In two, biotin dextran amine was used as tracer; in the third, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used. Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Intracortical projections were found into the neighboring primary motor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, frontoopercular cortex, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. Projections also ended in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex and agranular as well as granular insula. In addition, weaker labeling was found in the inferior and dorsal parietal cortex, and perirhinal and inferotemporal cortex. Subcortically, there was a heavy projection into the ventral putamen, a moderate projection into the caudate nucleus and claustrum, and a weak projection into the anterior, central and lateral amygdala. In the thalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis lateralis, reticularis, centralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, pulvinaris oralis, centrum medianum, reuniens and suprageniculatus in an order of intensity. Subthalamically, weak projections could be traced into the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the colliculus superior, area praetectalis, dorsal reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal gray. In the lower brainstem, fibers ended in the griseum pontis, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation, paramedian and dorsal reticular nuclei, solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus itself; there were, however, terminals in the immediately bordering reticular formation. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

These circuits predominantly connect primary and secondary visual cortex with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although there are direct geniculocortical inputs to extrastriate visual cortex, whether reciprocal corticogeniculate neurons exist in extrastriate cortex is not known. Here we utilized virus-mediated retrograde tracing to reveal the presence of corticogeniculate neurons in three mid-level extrastriate visual cortical areas in ferrets: PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. We observed corticogeniculate neurons in all three extrastriate areas, although the density of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons in extrastriate cortex was an order of magnitude less than that in areas 17 and 18. A cluster analysis of morphological metrics quantified following reconstructions of the full dendritic arborizations of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons revealed six distinct cell types. Similar corticogeniculate cell types to those observed in areas 17 and 18 were also observed in PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. However, these unique cell types were not equally distributed across the three extrastriate areas. The majority of corticogeniculate neurons per cluster originated in a single area, suggesting unique parallel organizations for corticogeniculate feedback from each extrastriate area to the LGN. Together, our findings demonstrate direct feedback connections from mid-level extrastriate visual cortex to the LGN, supporting complementary reciprocal circuits at multiple processing stages along the visual hierarchy. Importantly, direct reciprocal connections between the LGN and extrastriate cortex, that bypass V1, could provide a substrate for residual vision following V1 damage.;"[Adusei, Matthew; Briggs, Farran] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Neurosci Grad Program, 601 Elmwood Ave Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Hasse, J.

Little is known about cuneate functional organization in primates or about how cuneate and area 3b organization are related. In this study, neurophysiologic approaches were used to evaluate how tactile inputs from the hand and adjacent body are organized in the cuneate nucleus of squirrel monkeys. Cuneate data on the organization of hand inputs were then compared with analogous area 3b data from our earlier cortical studies that used the same approaches. Evaluations of several cuneate properties, including (1) responsiveness to tactile stimulation, (2) incidences and sizes of receptive fields, (3) somatotopic progressions, (4) properties of representations, and (5) relationships between functional inputs and cytochrome oxidase staining, suggest that tactile afferents from the hand form consistently organized cuneate representations that, in turn, relate to the parcellated organization of cuneate structural substrates. Comparisons of cuneate and area 3b organization indicate that tactile processing from the brainstem to cortex involves a preservation of tactile responsiveness and somatotopic organization but, in addition, involves transformations that produce receptive field sharpening, suppression of hairy hand inputs, amplification and refinement of glabrous inputs, and relocations of representations. Ascending lemniscal substrates are characterized by cascading excitatory convergence/divergence that increments at successively higher levels between sensory afferents and area 3b. It is suggested that the observed preservations and transformations reflect this organization but, in addition, reflect mechanisms that cause counterbalancing sharpening and suppressions of hand inputs.

Neural circuit mechanisms based on neuronal and synaptic properties have been shown to process temporal information over the range of tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds(5-7). How neural circuits process temporal information in the range of seconds to minutes is much less understood. Studies of working memory in monkeys and rats have shown that neurons in the prefrontal cortex(8-10), the parietal cortex(9,11) and the thalamus(12) exhibit ramping activities that linearly correlate with the lapse of time until the end of a specific time interval of several seconds that the animal is trained to memorize. Many organisms can also memorize the time interval of rhythmic sensory stimuli in the timescale of seconds and can coordinate motor behaviour accordingly, for example, by keeping the rhythm after exposure to the beat of music. Here we report a form of rhythmic activity among specific neuronal ensembles in the zebrafish optic tectum, which retains the memory of the time interval ( in the order of seconds) of repetitive sensory stimuli for a duration of up to similar to 20 s. After repetitive visual conditioning stimulation ( CS) of zebrafish larvae, we observed rhythmic post-CS activities among specific tectal neuronal ensembles, with a regular interval that closely matched the CS. Visuomotor behaviour of the zebrafish larvae also showed regular post- CS repetitions at the entrained time interval that correlated with rhythmic neuronal ensemble activities in the tectum. Thus, rhythmic activities among specific neuronal ensembles may act as an adjustable 'metronome' for time intervals in the order of seconds, and serve as a mechanism for the short- term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experience.;"[Sumbre, German; Poo, Mu-ming] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Muto, Akira; Baier, Herwig] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Physiol, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA";"University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Francisco";Poo, MM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Div Neurobiol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;mpoo@berkeley.edu;"Sumbre, German/K-7538-2017; Muto, Akira/E-2580-2015";"Sumbre, German/0000-0003-4436-6840; Baier, Herwig/0000-0002-7268-0469; Muto, Akira/0000-0003-4276-1775";US National Institutes of Health;US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);We thank A.

Evidence from cytoarchitectonic, stimulation, and functional studies suggests structural and functional divergence between the two subregions. However, a microstructural map of these areas obtained in a representative sample of brains in a stereotaxic reference space is still lacking. In the present study we show that the dorsal mesial frontal motor cortex comprises two microstructurally different brain regions: area SMA and area pre-SMA. Area-specific cytoarchitectonic patterns were studied in serial histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten human postmortem brains. Borders of the two cortical areas were identified using image analysis and statistical features. The 3D reconstructed areas were transferred to a common reference space, and probabilistic maps were calculated by superimposing the individual maps. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging data was subsequently performed using the two probabilistic maps as microstructurally defined seed regions. It revealed that areas SMA and pre-SMA were strongly co-activated with areas in precentral, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri, Rolandic operculum, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. Both areas were related to motor functions, but area pre-SMA was involved in more complex processes such as learning, cognitive processes and perception. The here described subsequent analyses led to converging evidence supporting the microstructural, and functional segregation of areas SMA and pre-SMA, and maps will be made available to the scientific community to further elucidate the microstructural substrates of motor and cognitive control.;"[Ruan, Jianghai; Caspers, Svenja; Amunts, Katrin] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, C&O Vogt Inst Brain Res, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Ruan, Jianghai] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Neurol, Luzhou, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Jianghai; Seitz, Ruediger J.] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, LVR Klinikum Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Ctr Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Bludau, Sebastian; Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola; Caspers, Svenja; Mohlberg, Hartmut; Amunts, Katrin] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 1, Julich, Germany; [Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany; [Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola] JARA Translat Brain Med, Aachen, Germany; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Inst Syst Neurosci, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Eickhoff, Simon B.] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neuroscience & Med INM 7, Julich, Germany; [Seitz, Ruediger J.] Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Dept Neurol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Seitz, Ruediger J.] Florey Neurosci Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";"Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Southwest Medical University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; RWTH Aachen University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health";"Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, LVR Klinikum Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Ctr Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Med Fac, Dept Neurol, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Seitz, RJ (corresponding author), Florey Neurosci Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.";seitz@neurologie.uni-duesseldorf.de;"Palomero-Gallagher, Nicola/N-8886-2014; Caspers, Svenja/H-9346-2013; Amunts, Katrin/I-3470-2013; Ruan, Jianghai/AAT-4188-2021; ruan, jianghai/ABC-8295-2021; Eickhoff, Simon B./K-2061-2013";"Caspers, Svenja/0000-0001-5083-4669; Amunts, Katrin/0000-0001-5828-0867; Ruan, Jianghai/0000-0002-0915-292X; Bludau, Sebastian/0000-0001-6173-9050; Mohlberg, Hartmut/0000-0002-7040-3812; Eickhoff, Simon B./0000-0001-6363-2759";"China Scholarship Council; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [785907]";"China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme";We thank the China Scholarship Council for sponsorship of Jianghai Ruan, and Mr. Ulrich Opfermann-Emmerich for excellent technical assistance.

However, both aging and estradiol regulate SERT binding sites in the brain. The goal of this experiment was to determine how aging and estrogen interact to regulate SERT levels in the forebrain of young and reproductively senescent female Sprague-Dawley rats using [H-3]paroxetine. The density of specific [H-3]paroxetine binding in various brain regions was compared in young (2-4 months) and reproductively senescent (10-12 months) female rats at three times of day. In most brain regions examined, estrogen and aging independently increased the number of [H-3]paroxetine binding sites. The only region that displayed a reduction in [H-3]paroxetine binding with age was the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Time of day influenced [H-3]paroxetine binding in the SCN and the paraventricular thalamus (PVT), two regions known to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Aging and/or estrogen also altered the pattern of binding in these regions. Thus, based on the results of this study, we conclude that aging and estrogen both act to regulate SERT binding sites in the forebrain of female rats, and that this regulation is region specific.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has antiapoptotic properties in several brain injury models. Here, we tested whether DEX can protect the brain from neurodegeneration in rats exposed to propofol in utero. Materials and Methods: Fetal rats of embryonic day 20 were exposed in utero for 1 hour to propofol anesthesia with DEX or saline, or no anesthesia (control). The fetal brains were harvested 6 hours later. Cleaved caspase-3 levels and the relative number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1)-positive cells were assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Learning and memory functions of the offspring in a separate cohort were assessed at postnatal day 35 by using an 8-arm radial maze. Results: Propofol anesthesia in pregnant rats augmented caspase-3 activation by 217% in the brain tissues of fetal rats and increased the number of IBA1-positive cells in the cortex by 40% and in the thalamus by 270%. Juvenile rats exposed pre-natally to propofol were not different than controls on spontaneous locomotor activity, but made more errors of omission and took longer to complete visiting all 8 arms on days 1, 2, and 3 across a 5-day test in the radial arm maze. This neurocognitive deficit was prevented by administration of DEX (5.0 mu g/kg, IP), which also significantly inhibited propofol-induced caspase-3 activation and microglial response in the fetal brains. Conclusions: DEX attenuates neuronal injury induced by maternal propofol anesthesia in the fetal brains, providing neurocognitive protection in the offspring rats.;"[Li, Jing; Xiong, Ming; Nadavaluru, Pratap R.; Zuo, Wanhong; Ye, Jiang Hong; Eloy, Jean D.; Bekker, Alex] Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Dept Anesthesiol, 185 S Orange Ave, Newark, NJ 07103 USA";"Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University Medical Center";Bekker, A (corresponding author), Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Dept Anesthesiol, 185 S Orange Ave, Newark, NJ 07103 USA.;bekkeray@njms.rutgers.edu;Eloy, Jean/AAE-8158-2022;Eloy, Jean/0000-0002-3555-9432;;;;;47;54;58;0;9;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0898-4921;1537-1921;;J NEUROSURG ANESTH;J.

Such studies do not, however, reveal which particular cell types within the S1 cortex receive direct monosynaptic connections from these input sources. Here we describe the monosynaptic inputs to a subpopulation of mouse S1 inhibitory neurons that express ErbB4. We used a previously described bridge protein,'' composed of the ErbB4 ligand, neuregulin (NRG1), fused to the avian viral receptor TVB (TVB-NRG1), along with EnvB pseudotyped lentivirus (LV) and rabies virus (RV), to selectively coinfect ErbB4-expressing neurons (Choi et al. [2010] Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:16703-16708). The RV had its glycoprotein gene deleted and replaced with mCherry, so that infected cells express mCherry and the virus cannot spread without provision of rabies glycoprotein (RG) by transcomplementation. The LV encoded and expressed RG to allow transcomplementation in coinfected neurons, so that the RV could spread transsynaptically and label their direct monosynaptic inputs. The RV could not spread beyond the direct inputs, due to the lack of RG in presynaptic cells. This method revealed long-range connections from thalamus, nucleus basalis, raphe, and distant cortical areas, including ipsilateral motor, secondary somatosensory, retrosplenial, and perirhinal cortex and contralateral S1. In addition, local connections from ipsilateral pyramidal neurons within S1 were labeled. These input sources account for all of the known inputs to S1 described with standard tracers, suggesting that the subpopulation of ErbB4-positive inhibitory neurons infected using the TVB-NRG1 bridge protein receives inputs indiscriminately from S1 input sources.

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sympathetic outflow to the heart is modulated by the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the cortical modulation of cardiovagal activity is still unclear in humans. The present study used functional MRI to investigate the cortical network involved in cardiovagal control. Seventeen healthy individuals performed graded handgrip exercise while heart rate (HR) and cortical activity were recorded. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were measured while participants repeated the same protocol in a parallel experiment session. The handgrip exercise elevated HR and MAP without concurrent elevations in MSNA supporting earlier conclusions that the cardiovascular responses are mainly modulated by vagal withdrawal. The imaging data showed activation in the insular cortex, thalamus, parietal cortices and cerebellum during the exercise period. Consistently across all the participants, the HR response correlated with the deactivation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), which has substantial anatomical connection with the subcortical autonomic structures. The deactivation of the vMPFC was independent of the motor control and was observed commonly in both left and right hand exercise. Stronger vMPFC deactivation was observed when participants completed a higher intensity exercise that elicited a larger HR response. Our findings support the hypothesis that the vMPFC is involved in modulating the vagal efferent outflow to the heart and the suppression of its activity elevates cardiovascular arousal in conscious humans.

It has been implicated in human disorders of social and emotional behavior, such as autism. Of the interconnected functional networks, considerable research in rodents and primates has focused on connections between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The amygdala projects to OFC by both a direct amygdalocortical (AC) pathway and an indirect pathway through mediodorsal thalamus. In the rat, retrograde tracer experiments indicate that the AC and amygdalothalamic (AT) pathways originate from separate populations, and may therefore convey distinctive infonnation, although the characteristics of these pathways remain unclear. To investigate this issue in monkeys we made anterograde tracer injections in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC; n = 3). Three distinctive features were found preferentially associated with the AT or AC pathways. First, AT terminations are large (average diameter = 3.5 mu m; range = 1.2-7.0 mu m) and cluster around proximal dendrites, in contrast with small-bouton AC terminations. Second, AT terminations form small arbors (diameter approximate to 0.1 mm), while AC are widely divergent (often > 1.0 mm long). The AT terminations features are reminiscent of large bouton, driver corticothalamic terminations. Finally, AC but not AT terminations are positive for zinc (Zn), a neuromodulator associated with synaptic plasticity. From these results we suggest that AC and AT terminations originate from distinct populations in monkey as well as in rodent. Further work is necessary to determine the degree and manner of their segregation and how these subsystems interact within a broader connectivity network.";"RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Sakura Ku, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan";"RIKEN; Kyoto University; Saitama University";Miyashita, T (corresponding author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;toshio@brain.riken.jp;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;91;32;32;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

To establish the use of such tracers in the nonhuman primate, we recently compared the specificity of the anterograde tracer Mn2+ with that of wheat-germ-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) in experiments tracing the neuronal connections of the basal ganglia of the monkey. It was shown that Mn2+ and WGA-HRP yield the same projection patterns and that the former tracer crosses at least two synapses, for it could be found in thalamus following injections into the striatum. Here we provide evidence that Mn2+ reaches the cortex following striaturn injections and, thus, is transferred even further than previously shown. In other words, used as a paramagnetic MRI tracer, Mn2+ can permit the visualization of neural networks covering at least four processing stages. Moreover, unilateral intravitreal injections show that Mn2+ is sufficiently synapse specific to pen-nit visualization of the lamina of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Interestingly, the transfer rate of the substance reflected the well-known axonal size differences between the parvocellular and magnocellular layers of dLGN. After intravitreal injections, we were able to demonstrate transfer of Mn2+ into several subcortical and cortical areas, including the inferotemporal cortex. The specificity of the transsynaptic transfer of manganese that we report here indicates the value of this tracer for chronic studies of development and plasticity, as well as for studies of brain pathology.

Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by reinnervation of denervated targets by regenerating injured axons or by collateral branching Of undamaged axons, and remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of adequate tat-get reinnervation; however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, Such as neuropathic pain and hyperreflexia. After axotomy, neurons shift from a transmitter to a regenerative phenotype, activating molecular pathways that promote neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Peripheral nerve injuries also induce a cascade of events, at the Molecular, cellular, and system levels, initiated by the injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, thalamus, and brain cortex. Mechanisms involved in these changes include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of sensory and motor central maps. An important direction for research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, and are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying positive adaptive changes that improve functional recovery and also reducing undesirable effects.";"[Navarro, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Xavier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Cell Biol Physiol & Immunol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain";"Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona";Navarro, X (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.;;Navarro, Xavier/C-9577-2011;Navarro, Xavier/0000-0001-9849-902X;;;;;129;70;71;1;20;ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC;SAN DIEGO;525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;0074-7742;;978-0-12-375084-6;INT REV NEUROBIOL;Int.

Previous studies have attempted to describe the ontogeny of cerebral glucose metabolism in anesthetized nonhuman primates using [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. However, the use of sedation during the tracer uptake period may influence 1CMR(glc). This study was conducted to describe 1CMR(glc) in conscious infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) during the first year of life utilizing FDG-PET. Cross-sectional studies (n = 23) displayed lowest and highest 1CMR(glc) in all structures at the 2-3 and 8-9 month age groups, respectively. The metabolic pattern suggested an increase in 1CMR(glc) values between 2 and 8 months of age with decreased metabolism observed at 10-12 months of age in all regions. Peak 1CMR(glc) values at 8 months were an average of 84+/-24% higher than values seen at the youngest age examined quantitatively (2-3 months). The regions of greatest and smallest increases in 1CMR(glc) at 8 months were the cerebellar hemispheres (90%) and the thalamus (39%), respectively. Longitudinal analysis in 4 animals supported this developmental pattern, demonstrating the ability to detect changes in cerebral glucose metabolism within animals and the potential for FDG-PET in nonhuman primate models of brain maturation.

The distribution of neuronal populations containing the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and parvalbumin, which are recognized markers for the GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex, is compared in five species of toothed whales and in representatives (one species each) of insectivores, bats, rodents, and primates. Computerized image analysis has shown that overall quantitative characteristics of GABAergic cortical neurons in toothed whales are similar to those in other mammalian orders. Thus, GABA-positive neurons represent 26% of the total population of cortical neurons in the visual cortex of whales. Some 97% of GABA-positive cells contain calcium-binding proteins, which is numerically similar to these parameters found in primates and other mammals. On the other hand, the typology and laminar distribution of calcium-binding protein-containing neurons in the primary visual cortex of five whale species (Delphinapterus leucas, Globicephala melaena, Phocoena phocoena, Stenella coeruleoalba, and Tursiops truncatus) differ significantly from those of primates (Macaca mulatta) and rodents (Rattus rattus) and are similar to those found in insectivorous bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). In whales, bats, and hedgehogs a significant concentration of calbindin-positive, vertically oriented bipolar and bitufted neurons was found in layers I, II, and IIIc/V with their axons arranged in a three-dimensional network. In primates and rodents they are distributed evenly across all cortical layers and are predominantly multipolar or bitufted neurons found in all cortical layers with their axons oriented along the vertical axis of the cortical plate. The parvalbumin-positive neurons in all mammalian species, including toothed whales, are represented by variously sized multipolar non-pyramidal cells. As opposed to all other mammalian species, the major concentrations of parvalbumin-positive neurons in whales are found in layers IIIc/V and VI, whereas in other cortical layers there are only scattered parvalbumin-positive neurons. Thus, in layers IIIc/V and VI calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neuronal populations form overlapping populations. In other mammalian species the parvalbumin-positive neurons are distributed more evenly between different cortical layers. The other prominent difference between mammalian orders was found in the quantitative relationships between calbindin-positive and parvalbumin-positive cortical neurons. Thus, the cortical calbindin-positive neuronal population is significantly (two to four times) higher relative to the parvalbumin-positive population of neurons in whales and evolutionary conservative mammals (bats and hedgehogs), whereas in phylogenetically progressive mammals (primates) and moderately progressive mammals (rodents) calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive populations are approximately equal in their relative concentrations. These data suggest that in cetacean primary visual cortex, as well as in primary cortices of prototypal terrestrial mammals, the calbindin-positive system of neurons is expressed considerably stronger than the parvalbumin system. These findings may relate to the absence or incipience (i.e., relatively poor development) of layer IV and hypertrophy of layers I and II in cetacean and prototypal mammalian sensory neocortices. This, in turn, suggests several important differences between prototypal and evolutionary progressive mammalian orders in the organization of neocortical afferentation. In whales and, to a lesser extent, in archetypal terrestrial mammals calbindin-positive nuclei of the thalamus may send strong calbindin-positive afferents to calbindin-rich superficial cortical layers as well as to limited mid-cortical layers, whereas parvalbumin-positive afferents from the thalamus may be reduced in view of the absence or incipience of layer IV.;"CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL,NEW YORK,NY 10029; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV,NEW YORK,NY 10029; YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT OBSTET & GYNECOL,DIV NEUROSCI,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510; WORCESTER FDN EXPTL BIOL INC,NEUROBIOL LAB,SHREWSBURY,MA 01545";"City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Yale University; Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research";GLEZER, II (corresponding author), CUNY,SCH MED,DEPT CELL BIOL & ANAT SCI,138 ST & CONVENT AVE,SCI BLDG,ROOM J-903,NEW YORK,NY 10031, USA.;;;;"NICHD NIH HHS [HD-06364, HD-23830] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-26068] Funding Source: Medline";"NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;88;71;71;0;3;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Cortex 1:1-47). Some anatomical evidence, such as differences in the laminar distribution of the neurons of origin and of the terminations of their axons, has supported this division. However, very little is actually known about the distribution and morphology of the neurons of the feedback projections. In order to contribute further to our understanding of these two components of the corticocortical projections, I studied the distribution and morphology of a feedback projection, the reciprocal projection from the posterior medial lateral suprasylvian sulcus (PMLS), to primary visual cortex (area 17). Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent tracers in vivo combined with intracellular dye injections in lightly fixed cortical slices revealed many similarities between the feedforward and feedback projections: 1) They both emanate from all layers but layer 1; 2) each layer of origin contains a wide variety of standard and/or inverted pyramidal neurons; and 3) all of these, with the exception of a rare, large layer 5 neuron, have dendritic fields restricted principally to their layers of origin. There was, however, one major difference between the feedforward and feedback projections: In contrast to the projection from area 17 to PMLS, the projection from PMLS had a dense projection from layer 6 that comprised a striking abundance of spiny fusiform and inverted pyramidal neurons. These were morphologically distinct from other layer 6 neurons that project to the thalamus. Taken together, these data suggest that the reciprocal projections between area 17 and area PMLS, although not completely equivalent, share essential features that form a distinct population of neurons differing in morphology from corticothalamic projection neurons.

This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.

He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' Swiss period (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called supplementary motor area was rather a supramotor area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored. Methodology: We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of mu-opioid receptors. Principal Findings: In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with mu-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[C-11] methyl] buprenorphine ([C-11]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition. Conclusions: Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research.;"[Seah, Stephanie; Asad, Abu Bakar Ali; Williams, Donald S.; Evelhoch, Jeffrey L.; Chin, Chih-Liang] Merck & Co Inc, Imaging, West Point, PA 19486 USA; [Seah, Stephanie; Asad, Abu Bakar Ali; Reese, Torsten; Henry, Brian; Chin, Chih-Liang] MSD, Translat Med Res Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Baumgartner, Richard; Feng, Dai] Merck & Co Inc, Rahway, NJ 07065 USA; [Manigbas, Elaine; Beaver, John D.] Maccine Pte Ltd, Imaging, Singapore, Singapore";"Merck & Company; Merck & Company; Merck & Company";Seah, S (corresponding author), Merck & Co Inc, Imaging, West Point, PA 19486 USA.;stephanie.seah@merck.com;"Evelhoch, Jeffrey/R-2619-2019; biomaGUNE, CIC/J-9136-2014";biomaGUNE, CIC/0000-0001-7690-0660;Merck Co.;Merck Co.(Merck & Company);This research was funded by Merck & Co.

Small bistratified cells ( SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow- OFF [ S- ON/( L + M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high- acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center- surround spatial structure, with the ( L + M)- OFF component of the receptive field similar to 50% larger in diameter than the S- ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the ( L + M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S- ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF- parasol cells. The ( L + M)- OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L- APB. These observations indicate that the ( L + M)- OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF- bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON- parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.;"Salk Inst Biol Studies, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Inst Particle Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA";"Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz";Field, GD (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;gfield@salk.edu;Field, Greg/AAI-1428-2021;"Field, Greg/0000-0001-5942-2679; Chichilnisky, E.J./0000-0002-5613-0248; Sher, Alexander/0000-0001-6655-6456; Gauthier, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0509-8532";NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY017992, EY017992] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;96;122;126;0;15;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Retrograde tracers were used to identify the sources of auditory cortical projections to primary visual cortex (areas 17 and 18) in adult cats. Two groups of animals were studied. In the first group, large deposits were centered on the lower visual field representation of the vertical meridian located along the area 17 and 18 border. Following tissue processing, characteristic patterns of cell body labeling were identified in extrastriate visual cortex and the visual thalamus (LGN, MIN, & LPl). In auditory cortex, of the four tonotopically-organized regions, neuronal labeling was identified in the supragranular layers of the posterior auditory field (PAF). Little to no labeling was evident in the primary auditory cortex, the anterior auditory field, the ventral posterior auditory field or in the remaining six non-tonotopically organized regions of auditory cortex. In the second group, small deposits were made into the central or peripheral visual field representations of primary visual cortex. Labeled cells were identified in PAF following deposits into regions of primary visual cortex representing peripheral, but not central, visual field representations. Furthermore, a coarse topography was identified in PAF, with neurons projecting to the upper field representation being located in the gyral portion of PAF and neurons projecting to the lower field representation located in the sulcal portion of PAF. Therefore, direct projections can be identified from tonotopically organized auditory cortex to the earliest stages of visual cortical processing.;"[Lomber, Stephen G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Cerebral Syst Lab, Ctr Brain & Mind,Schulich Sch Med & Dent, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; [Hall, Amee J.] Univ Western Ontario, Grad Program Neurosci, London, ON N6A 5B8, Canada; [Lomber, Stephen G.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, Fac Social Sci, Cerebral Syst Lab, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada";"Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario)";Lomber, SG (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Cerebral Syst Lab, Ctr Brain & Mind,Schulich Sch Med & Dent, M216 Med Sci Bldg, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada.;steve.lomber@uwo.ca;Lomber, Stephen G/B-6820-2015;Lomber, Stephen G/0000-0002-3001-7909;"Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada";"Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))";We would like to thank Jeffrey Mellott for assistance with the preparation of the tissue.

Neural activity was assessed in normal volunteers by changes in rCBF measured with PET. Thirteen right-handed subjects participated in three monocular tasks: (i) resting with eyes closed; (ii) sustained foveal fixation upon a LED at 1.2 m (0.83 D); and (iii) accommodating alternately on a near (24 cm, 4.16 D) vs. a far (3.0 m, 0.33 D) LED alternately illuminated in sequential 2 s epochs. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation and of constant foveal fixation revealed activation in cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; middle and inferior temporal cortex (BA 20, 21, 37); striate cortex and associative visual areas (BA 17/18). Comparison of the condition of constant fixation with the condition of resting with closed eyes indicated activation of cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; visual cortices (BA 17/18); a right hemisphere dominant network encompassing prefrontal (BA 6, 9, 47), superior parietal (BA 7), and superior temporal (BA 40) cortices; and bilateral thalamus. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation with closed-eye rest reflected an incremental summation of the activations found in the previous comparisons (i.e. activations associated with constant fixation).

These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field ( which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.";"Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA; Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland";"The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute; University of Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich";Carandini, M (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 2318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.;matteo@ski.org;"Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021; Bonin, Vincent/AAQ-3833-2020; Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008";"Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Bonin, Vincent/0000-0002-9437-8092";;;;;101;172;172;0;16;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Three different tracers were used: biotin-conjugated dextranamine (BDA), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and H-3-leucine. Intracortical projections were found to the motor cortex around the injection site, the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, the homologues of the primate frontoparietal operculum and insula, the anterior cingulate and agrannular retrosplenial cortex, the somatosensory and bordering inferior parietal cortex as well as to the perirhinal cortex. Except the very weak projections into the retrosplenial, posterior parietal and perirhinal region which were ipsilateral, all other projections were bilateral. Subcortically, there was a projection into the ventral putamen, rostrodorsal claustrum and, very sparsely, into the caudate nucleus. In the rhalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei reticularis, anteroventralis, anteromedialis, ventralis lateralis, ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis posterior inferior, medialis dorsalis, in the intralaminar nuclei paracentralis, centralis lateralis, centrum medianum and parafascicularis, in the midline thalamus and in the nuclei posterior and pulvinaris. Further diencephalic projections, however all of them weak, could be traced into the zona incerta, dorsolateral subthalamus, dorsomedial, lateral and supraoptic hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the lateral superior colliculus, in the bordering reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal grey. In the lower brainstem, fibres ended in the griseum pontis, dorsolateral reticular formation, principal and spinal trigeminal nucleus and, sparsely, in the lateral parabrachial region, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olive and magnocellular reticular formation. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus. The projection system revealed with PHA-L was less extensive than that demonstrated with BDA and H-3-leucine, both of which were similar.;GERMAN PRIMATE CTR,DEPT NEUROBIOL,D-37077 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY;Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ);;;;;;;;;49;9;9;0;2;V W B -VERLAG WISSENSCHAFT & BILDUNG;BERLIN;AMAND AGLASTER, POSTFACH 11 03 68, D-10833 BERLIN, GERMANY;0944-8160;;;J BRAIN RES;J.

To assess the organization of pallidothalamic projections originating from motor and associative portions of GPi, small quantities of the anterograde/retrograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into localized regions of the caudal GPi in squirrel monkeys. The localization to motor and associative territories in GPi was confirmed by examining the corresponding regions of retrograde labeling in the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The labeled pallidothalamic fibers projected principally medially across the inferior edge of the internal capsule. The fiber bundle ventral to the caudal GPi was mainly devoid of labeling. Fibers labeled along the medial and inferior borders of GPi at centrorostral levels were traceable to the medial edge of the injections. The densest fiber labeling at rostral levels was produced by those injections with the greatest extent of rostral labeling of neurons. In opposition to generally accepted schemes, the findings from this study suggest that the pallidothalamic fibers originating from the caudal portions of GPi, including the motor territory, do not course ventromedially to form the ansa lenticularis, but rather, travel predominately medially through the lenticular fasciculus en route to the thalamus. Thus, proposed surgical schemes to target fibers ventral to the caudal GPi or at the rostral pole of GPi appear to be misguided. J. Comp. Neurol. 429:490-501, 2001.

In one subgroup (E, type 1), axons have an elongated terminal field and thin, spinous terminations; in the other (R, type 2), axons have a small, round arbor and large, beaded terminations. Previous work (Rockland, 1996) indicates that E-type axons from several occipitotemporal areas branch extensively within and sometimes between pulvinar subdivisions, but that R-type axons tend to have spatially delimited arbors. The present report is a further investigation of R-type axons from areas VI and MT and was initiated to test the generality of the previous findings. There are four :main results: 1) By serial section reconstruction of anterogradely labeled axons, 10 of 25 axons originating in area V1 had two or three spatially separate arbors (8 and 2 axons, respectively). Sixteen axons analyzed from area MT, however, all had single arbors, although the arbors were often formed by the convergence of widely separate branches. 2) Multiple (at least 2-5) R-type corticopulvinar axons, from V1 or from MT, can converge in a single focus. 3) R-type axons originating from both areas V1 and MT can branch to other structures; namely, the superior colliculus, the pretectal area, and/or the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. 4) Finally, corticopulvinar terminations from area V1 are predominantly R-type, whereas those from MT are more predominantly E-type. These results thus provide additional evidence of the special relationship of area V1 to the pulvinar. They also emphasize that the idea of corticopulvinocortical feedback loops, although convenient as a shorthand nomenclature, does not adequately convey the full complexity of the system.

We sought to evaluate the specificity and extent of volume loss-of the major forebrain regions in epileptic rats months after kainate-induced status epilepticus. In systematic series of Nissl-stained sections, the areas of major forebrain regions were measured, and volumes were estimated using the Cavalieri principle. In some regions, the optical fractionator method was used to estimate neuron numbers. Most kainate-treated rats showed significant volume loss in the amygdala, olfactory cortex, and septal region, but others displayed different patterns, with significant loss only in the hippocampus or thalamus, for example. Average volume loss was most severe in the amygdala and olfactory cortex (82-83% of controls), especially the caudal parts of both regions. In the piriform cortex (including the endopiriform nucleus) of epileptic rats, an average of approximately one-third of Nissl-stained neurons and one-third of the GABAergic interneurons labeled by in situ hybridization for GAD67 mRNA were lost, and the extent of neuron loss was correlated with the extent of volume loss. Volumetric analysis of major forebrain regions was insensitive to specific neuron loss in subregions such as layer III of the entorhinal cortex and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. These findings provide quantitative evidence that kainate-treated rats tend to display extensive neuron and volume loss in the amygdala and olfactory cortex, although the patterns and extent of loss in forebrain regions vary considerably among individuals. In this status epilepticus-based model, extrahippocampal damage appears to be more extensive and hippocampal damage appears to be less extensive than that reported for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

We aimed to define the development of such cortical reorganisation by comparing data from patients with different disease phenotypes. Methods We studied patients with different phenotypes of MS: 16 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 14 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and no disability, 15 patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability, and 12 patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Patients did a simple motor task with their unimpaired dominant hand during MRI, which was compared across the phenotype groups. Findings Patients with a CIS activated more of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex than those with RRMS and no disability, whereas patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the supplementary motor area than those with a CIS. Patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally, and more of the ipsilateral supplementary motor area than patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability. Conversely, patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral. secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, and the ipsilateral precuneus. Patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral thalamus and of the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex than those with SPMS. However, patients with SPMS activated more of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the contralateral precuneus, and the ipsilateral cingulate motor area and inferior parietal lobule. Interpretation Movement-associated cortical reorganisation in patients with MS seems to vary across individuals at different stages of disease. Our study suggests that early in the disease course more areas typically devoted to motor tasks are recruited. Then bilateral activation of these regions is seen, and late in the disease course, areas that healthy people recruit to do novel or complex tasks are activated.;"Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Neuroimaging Res Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neuroradiol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; Osped Gallarate, Dept Neurol, Gallarate, Italy";"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele";Filippi, M (corresponding author), Sci Inst & Univ, Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neurol, Neuroimaging Res Unit, Via Olgettina 60, I-20132 Milan, Italy.;massimo.filippi@hsr.it;"Calabrese, Massimiliano/I-6195-2012; Martinelli, Vittorio/AAN-7240-2020; Filippi, Massimo/K-1755-2018; Rocca, Maria Assunta/K-1619-2018; ghezzi, angelo/AAJ-9606-2020";"Filippi, Massimo/0000-0002-5485-0479; Rocca, Maria Assunta/0000-0003-2358-4320; falini, andrea/0000-0002-1461-8755";;;;;63;200;207;0;4;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;1474-4422;1474-4465;;LANCET NEUROL;Lancet Neurol.;OCT;2005;4;10;;;;;618;626;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70171-X;;;9;Clinical Neurology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;969PG;16168930;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000232245900018;View Full Record in Web of Science

Effects of cortical feedback on the spatial properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus. J Neurophysiol 109: 889-899, 2013. First published October 24, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00194.2012.-Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.";"[Andolina, Ian M.; Jones, Helen E.; Sillito, Adam M.] UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, London EC1V 9EL, England";"University of London; University College London";Andolina, IM (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.;i.andolina@ucl.ac.uk;Andolina, Ian Max/S-7179-2019;Andolina, Ian Max/0000-0001-9985-3414;"Medical Research Council [G0701535]; Medical Research Council [G0701535] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0701535] Funding Source: UKRI";"Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";This work was supported by Medical Research Council Grant G0701535.;;87;30;30;0;14;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We completed this trial to determine if smoking cessation decreases the progression of cognitive decline in later life. Methods: We recruited older smokers (n = 229) and never smokers (n = 98) and invited smokers to join a smoking cessation trial. The primary outcome of interest was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores over 24 months. Secondary measures included the Logical Memory test and changes in gray matter density. Successful smoking cessation was defined as a minimum of 547 smoking free days during follow up. Results: The ADAS-cog scores of unsuccessful quitters (UQ) increased (i.e., became worse) 1.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.2 +/- 0.4 points more than the scores of never smokers (NS) (p = 0.001) and successful quitters (SQ) (p = 0.006) respectively over the 24 months of follow up. Similarly, the scores of UQ declined (i.e., became worse) relative to NS on measures of immediate (p = 0.004) and delayed recall (p = 0.029). All analyses were adjusted for age, years of education, baseline cognitive performance, alcohol use, depression scores, and the presence of chronic respiratory disease. Thirty-six NS, 18 SQ and 48 UQ completed the imaging substudy. Compared with NS, UQ showed a disproportional loss of gray matter density in the right thalamus, right and left inferior semi-lunar lobule, as well as left superior and inferior parietal lobule over 24 months. SQ showed loss of gray matter compared with NS in the right middle and inferior occipital gyri, right and left culmen, and the left superior frontal gyrus. We did not find any brain regions in which UQ had lost more gray matter than SQ over 2 years. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking causes cognitive decline and loss of gray matter tissue in the brain over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To examine the SN's involvement in sympathetic outflow, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in intrinsic connectivity of the SN correlate positively with resting postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) burst incidence (BI) in subjects without and with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Overnight polysomnography, 5-min rsMRI, and fibular MSNA recording were performed in 36 subjects (mean age 57 yr; 10 women, 26 men). Independent component analysis (ICA) of the entire cohort identified the SN as including bilateral IC, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). There was a positive correlation between BI and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (P < 0.001), but dual-regression analysis identified no differences in SN functional connectivity between subjects with no or mild OSA (n = 17) and moderate or severe (n = 19) OSA. Correlation analysis relating BI to the strength of connectivity within the SN revealed large (i.e., spatial extent) and strong correlations for the left IC (P < 0.001), right pgACC/MCC (P < 0.006), left TPJ (P < 0.004), thalamus (P < 0.035), and cerebellum (P < 0.013). Indexes of sleep apnea were unrelated to BI and the strength of SN connectivity. There were no relationships between BI and default or sensorimotor network connectivity. This study links connectivity within the SN to MSNA, demonstrating several of its nodes to be key sympathoexcitatory regions.";"[Taylor, Keri S.; Millar, Philip J.; Murai, Hisayoshi; Kimmerly, Derek S.; Morris, Beverley L.; Bradley, T.

Recent studies have shown that many neurons in the primate dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) show spatial tuning during inertial motion and that these responses are vestibular in origin. Given their well-studied role in processing visual self-motion cues (i.e., optic flow), these neurons may be involved in the integration of visual and vestibular signals to facilitate robust perception of self-motion. However, the temporal structure of vestibular responses in MSTd has not been characterized in detail. Specifically, it is not known whether MSTd neurons encode velocity, acceleration, or some combination of motion parameters not explicitly encoded by vestibular afferents. In this study, we have applied a frequency-domain analysis to single-unit responses during translation in three dimensions (3D). The analysis quantifies the stimulus-driven temporal modulation of each response as well as the degree to which this modulation reflects the velocity and/or acceleration profile of the stimulus. We show that MSTd neurons signal a combination of velocity and acceleration components with the velocity component being stronger for most neurons. These two components can exist both within and across motion directions, although their spatial tuning did not show a systematic relationship across the population. From these results, vestibular responses in MSTd appear to show characteristic features of spatiotemporal convergence, similar to previous findings in the brain stem and thalamus. The predominance of velocity encoding in this region may reflect the suitability of these signals to be integrated with visual signals regarding self-motion perception.";"[DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Visual Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Fetsch, Christopher R.; Rajguru, Suhrud M.; Karunaratne, Anuk; Gu, Yong; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Karunaratne, Anuk; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";"University of Rochester; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)";DeAngelis, GC (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Ctr Visual Sci, Meliora 315, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.;gdeangelis@cvs.rochester.edu;;DeAngelis, Gregory/0000-0002-1635-1273;National Institutes of Health [R01 EY-017866, EY-019087, EY-016178];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);The work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 EY-017866 and EY-019087 to D.

The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning.;"[Puigbo, J. -Y.; Maffei, G.; Herreros, I.; Verschure, P.

During one condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with tones separated by a constant interval (auditory synchronisation, AS), followed by tapping without the pacing stimulus (auditory continuation, AC). In another condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with a visual stimulus presented at the same frequency as the tones (visual synchronisation,VS) followed by a tapping sequence without visual pacing (visual continuation, VC). The following main results were obtained: (1) tapping in the context of visual pacing was generally more variable than tapping in the context of auditory stimuli; (2) during all conditions, a fronto-parietal network was active including the dorsal lateral premotor cortex (dPMC), M1, S1, inferior parietal lobule (LPi), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), the right cerebellar hemisphere, and the paravermial region; (3) stronger activation in the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), the left LPi, the SMA, the right inferior cerebellum, and the left thalamus during both auditory conditions (AS and AC) compared to the visual conditions (VS and VC); (4) stronger activation in the right superior cerebellum, the vermis, and the right LPi during the visual conditions (VS and VC); (5) similar activations for the AS and AC conditions; but (6) marked differences between the VS and VC conditions especially in the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and LPi areas; and (7) finally, there were no activations in the auditory and visual cortices when the pacing stimuli were absent. These findings were taken as evidence for a general difference between the motor control modes operative during the auditory and visual conditions. Paced finger tapping in the context of auditory pacing stimuli relies more on brain structures subserving internal motor control while paced finger-tapping in the context of visual pacing stimuli relies on brain structures relying on the subserving processing or imagination of visual pacing stimuli.

The cerebellum has interconnections with brainstem and thalamic reticular systems that subserve arousal. Autonomic activity is supported by the reciprocal interconnections with the hypothalamus. Limbic and paralimbic connections include the hypothalamus, septal region, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Associative connections consist of both feedforward and feedback limbs. The basilar pons receives inputs from the prefrontal, posterior parietal, superior temporal, parahippocampal, and cingulate cortices, as well as from the sensorimotor cortices. This information is conveyed from the pons to cerebellum, before it is relayed back via thalamus to the associative and paralimbic regions of the cerebral cortex. The anatomical arrangement of segregated loops of cerebral cortical connections stands in contrast to the cerebellar cortical architecture that is essentially uniform. This has theoretical and clinical ramifications. It is the anatomical basis for the dysmetria of thought hypothesis that postulates a universal cerebellar transform, in which the cerebellum performs its unique computation in a topographically precise manner on diverse streams of information relating to almost all aspects of behavior including cognition and emotion. It provides an anatomic basis for the observations of cerebellar activation by cognitive and affective paradigms in functional neuroimaging experiments. It helps explain the clinical phenomena that characterize the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome, and it provides an anatomic basis for a causal relationship between cerebellar pathology and psychiatric and neurobehavioral conditions. Knowledge of these anatomical pathways is critical to the further development of hypotheses, experimental approaches, and clinical questions that can advance the understanding of the contribution of the cerebellum to cognition and to disorders of intellect and emotion.;"Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA";"Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Schmahmann, JD (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Burnham 823,Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;;Schmahmann, Jeremy/ABF-1215-2021;Schmahmann, Jeremy/0000-0003-0706-5125;;;;;156;88;93;0;18;CARFAX PUBLISHING;BASINGSTOKE;RANKINE RD, BASINGSTOKE RG24 8PR, HANTS, ENGLAND;0954-0261;;;INT REV PSYCHIATR;Int.

To examine object-centred information processing, we measured regional cerebral blood flow in 11 normal subjects with PET. During each PET scan, a subject viewed a sample stimulus followed by a cue on a video screen, The sample consisted of two polygons, termed 'objects', each located in a corner of the screen. A small target spot appeared in a corner of each polygon, There were two tasks: the visuomotor task and the matching-to-sample task, In the visuomotor task, the subject moved a joystick in a direction indicated by either the location of the target spot inside the object (if object-centred coordinates were operative) or the location of the object relative to the video screen (if screen-centred coordinates were operative;), In the matching-to-sample task, the subject moved the joystick to report whether the relevant spatial information (object- or screen-centred) in the cue matched the sample. In both the visuomotor and the matching-to-sample task, use of object-centred (versus screen- or viewer-centred) information caused augmented activation in the inferior occipitotemporal cortex, bilaterally, in the left superior occipital gyrus, and in both the thalamus and the brainstem, In addition, in the visuomotor task such activation occurred in the right posterior parietal cortex and in the left ventral premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior supplementary motor areas. These findings suggest the involvement of the occipitotemporal cortex and a broad frontoparietal network when, as in the visuomotor task, object-centred information guides movement, When the same data underlie declarative reports, as in the matching-to-sample task, thp occipitotemporal cortex remains engaged but frontoparietal network diminishes in importance.";"NINDS, Human Motor Control Sect, Med Neurol Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, NIH, Poolesville, MD USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Hallett, M (corresponding author), NINDS, Human Motor Control Sect, Med Neurol Branch, NIH, Bldg 10,Room 5N226,10 Ctr Dr,MSC-1428, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;hallett@codon.nih.gov;"Deiber, Marie-Pierre/M-5949-2014; Deiber, Marie-Pierre/ABF-9026-2020";Deiber, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-4984-7363;;;;;69;41;41;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;NOV;1998;121;;11;;;;2145;2158;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/121.11.2145;;;14;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;145KY;9827774;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000077371100012;View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a modular neural network model of these areas that encodes the serial order of events into spatial patterns of PF activity. The model is based on the topographically specific circuits linking the PF with the basal ganglia. Each module traces a pathway from the PF, through the basal ganglia and thalamus, and back to the PF. The complete model consists of an array of modules interacting through recurrent corticostriatal projections and collateral inhibition between striatal spiny units. The model's architecture positions spiny units for the classification of cortical contexts and events and provides bistable cortical-thalamic loops for sustaining a representation of these contextual events in working memory activations. The model was tested with a simulated version of a delayed-sequencing task. In single-unit studies, the task begins with the presentation of a sequence of target lights. After a short delay, the monkey must touch the targets in the order in which they were presented. When instantiated with randomly distributed corticostriatal weights, the model produces different patterns of PF activation in response to different target sequences. These patterns represent an unambiguous and spatially distributed encoding of the sequence. Parameter studies of these random networks were used to compare the computational consequences of collateral and feed-forward inhibition within the striatum. In addition, we studied the receptive fields of 20,640 model units and uncovered an interesting set of cue-, rank- and sequence-related responses that qualitatively resemble responses reported in single unit studies of the PF. The majority of units respond to more than one sequence of stimuli. A method for analyzing serial receptive fields is presented and utilized for comparing the model units to single-unit data.;Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA;Northwestern University;Houk, JC (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, M211,Ward Bldg 5-315,303 E Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.;;;Beiser, David/0000-0001-9676-087X;NIMH NIH HHS [P50-MH-48185] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;105;186;187;0;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent K+ conductances contribute to a slow AHP in thalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons: a novel target for orexin receptors. J Neurophysiol 104: 2052-2062, 2010. First published August 18, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00320.2010. Thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) neurons exhibit a postburst apamin-resistant slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) that is unique to midline thalamus, displays activity dependence, and is abolished in tetrodotoxin. Analysis of the underlying sI(AHP) confirmed a requirement for Ca2+ influx with contributions from P/Q-, N-, L-, and R subtype channels, a reversal potential near E-K(+) and a significant reduction by UCL-2077, barium or TEA, consistent with a role for K-Ca channels. sI(AHP) was significantly reduced by activation of either the cAMP or the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Further analysis of the sAHP revealed an activity-dependent but Ca2+-independent component that was reduced in high [K+](o) and blockable after Na+ substitution with Li+ or in the presence of quinidine, suggesting a role for K-Na channels. The Ca2+-independent sAHP component was selectively reduced by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. The sAHP contributed to spike frequency adaptation, which was sensitive to activation of either cAMP or PKC signaling pathways and, near the peak of membrane hyperpolarization, was sufficient to cause de-inactivation of low threshold T-Type Ca2+ channels, thus promoting burst firing. PVT neurons are densely innervated by orexin-immunoreactive fibers, and depolarized by exogenously applied orexins. We now report that orexin A significantly reduced both Ca2+-dependent and -independent sI(AHP), and spike frequency adaptation. Furthermore orexin A-induced sI(AHP) inhibition was mediated through activation of PKC but not PKA. Collectively, these observations suggest that K-Ca and K-Na channels have a role in a sAHP that contributes to spike frequency adaptation and neuronal excitability in PVT neurons and that the sAHP is a novel target for modulation by the arousal-and feeding-promoting orexin neuropeptides.";"[Renaud, Leo P.] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Neurosci Program, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada";"University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa";Renaud, LP (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Neurosci Program, 725 Parkdale Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada.;lprenaud@ohri.ca;;Renaud, Leo/0000-0002-8559-8675;"Canadian Institutes of Health [MOP-77745]; Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery; Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa";"Canadian Institutes of Health(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada); Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa";This work was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant MOP-77745, the Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery, and the Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa.

Although each of these areas has a distinct structure and connections, they can be grouped into two networks, defined by cortico-cortical connections that primarily interconnect areas within each network. The networks also have different connections to the striatum, medial thalamus, and other brain regions. The orbital network consists of most of the areas In the orbital cortex. It receives several sensory inputs (olfactory, gustatory, visceral afferent, somatic sensory, and visual) that appear to be related to feeding. It also receives many limbic inputs from the amygdala, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and subiculum, including a specific projection from the ventrolateral part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. The orbital network may therefore serve as a substrate to integrate viscerosensory information with affective signals. The medial network consists of areas on the medial frontal surface together with a few select areas in the orbital cortex. These areas have few direct sensory inputs, and their limbic inputs are somewhat different than those to the orbital network (e.g., from the ventromedial part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus). However, they provide the major output from the OMPFC to the hypothalamus and brain stem (especially the periaqueductal gray). The medial network may therefore serve as visceromotor system to provide frontal cortical influence over autonomic and endocrine function. Connections between the networks presumably allow information now from viscerosensory to visceromotor systems. In addition to a probable role in eating behavior, this system appears to be involved in guiding behavior and regulation of mood. Lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex result in sociopathic behavior and difficulty in making appropriate choices, whereas functional imaging studies indicate that subjects with unipolar and bipolar depression have abnormal activity in medial and orbital prefrontal areas. Many of these areas also show volume changes and decreased glial number and density in mood-disordered subjects.;Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);Price, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;;;;;;;;46;302;305;0;14;NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES;NEW YORK;2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA;0077-8923;;1-57331-178-2;ANN NY ACAD SCI;Ann.NY Acad.Sci.;;1999;877;;;;;;383;396;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb09278.x;;;14;"Substance Abuse; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry";"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Substance Abuse; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry";BN31Y;10415660;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000081586500021;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent physiological data revealed that the disparity selective V2 cells increase their responses when (random-dot stereograms) stimuli within their receptive fields are at or near the boundary of a depth surface. Such highlights to depth (non-luminance) edges are seemingly not computationally required for the correspondence problem. Computationally, these highlights make the boundaries of a depth surface more salient, serving pre-attentive segmentation (between depth planes) and attracting visual attention. In special cases, they enable the psychophysically observed perceptual pop-out of a target from a background of visually identical distractors at a different depth. To achieve the highlights, mutual inhibition between disparity selective cells that are tuned to the same or similar depths is required. However, such mutual inhibition would impede the computation for the correspondence problem, which requires mutual excitation between the same cells. In this work, I introduce a computational model that, I believe, is the first to address both stereo correspondence and pre-attentive stereo segmentation. The computational mechanisms in the model are based on intracortical interactions in V2. I will demonstrate that the model captures the following physiological and psychophysical phenomena: (i) depth-edge highlighting; (ii) disparity capture; (iii) pop-out; and (iv) transparency.";UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England;"RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of London; University College London";Zhaoping, L (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Psychol, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.;;Zhaoping, Li/HLQ-0173-2023;;;;;;29;12;12;0;2;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

The time-course and sensitivity of excitatory postsynaptic potentials to current injected at the soma, and locations of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites, indicated that the majority of contributory synapses were located in layer V. Within a column of tissue, radius less than or equal to 250 mu m, the probability that a randomly selected layer III pyramid innervated a layer V pyramid was I in 4 if the target cell was a burst firing pyramid with an apical dendritic tuft in layers II/I. If, however, the potential target was a regular spiking pyramid, the probability of connectivity was only 1 in 40, and none of the 13 anatomically identified postsynaptic layer V targets had a slender apical dendrite terminating in layers IV/III. Morphological reconstructions indicated that layer III pyramids select target layer V cells whose apical dendrites pass within 50-100 mu m of the soma of the presynaptic pyramid in layer III and which have overlapping apical dendritic tufts in the superficial layers. The probability that a layer V cell would innervate a layer III pyramid lying within 250 mu m of its apical dendrite was much lower (one in 58). Both presynaptic layer III pyramids and their large postsynaptic layer V targets could therefore access similar inputs in layers I/II, while small layer V pyramids could not. One prediction from the present data would be that neither descending layer V inputs to the striatum or thalamus, nor transcallosal connections would be readily activated by longer distance cortico-cortical feedback connections that terminated in layers I/II. These could, however, activate corticofugal pathways to the superior colliculus or pens, both directly and via layer III. (C) 1998 IBRO.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and H-2 O-15 in nine normal volunteers while performing one control and two reaching tasks. In all tasks, visual stimuli were presented on a head mounted display (HMD). A target board was placed in front of the subjects bearing six red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) aligned on a circle with a green LED at its center. The center green LED and one of the six red LEDs, randomly selected, were repeatedly switched on and off, alternatively. In the control task, subjects were instructed to gaze at the lit LED. In the two reaching tasks, the reaching with visual feedback (RwithF) task and the reaching without visual feedback (RwithoutF) task, they had to point to the lit red LED with their right index fingers. In the RwithF task, their right hands were visible on the HMD before touching the target, whereas in the RwithoutF task, they were not visible. For each subject, subtraction images of each reaching task minus the control and the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task were calculated after transformation of PET images into the standard brain shape with an adjustable computerized brain atlas. These subtraction rCBF images were then averaged among the subjects, and significant changes of rCBF were identified. Significant increases in rCBF not only in the RwithF task minus control image but also in the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task image were observed in the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus of the right hemisphere, and the right cerebellum and vermis. These results indicate that the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere and the cerebellum are involved in integrating visual feedback of hand movements and execution of accurate pointing.;"Tohoku Univ, Dept Nucl Med & Radiol, IDAC, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Ctr Cyclotron & Radioisotope, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan";"Tohoku University; Tohoku University";Inoue, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Dept Nucl Med & Radiol, IDAC, Aoba Ku, 4-1 Seiryocho, Sendai, Miyagi 98077, Japan.;;;;;;;;68;65;66;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The force co-ordination pattern was investigated by means of a specially designed object that monitored the isometric fingertip forces applied to the contact surfaces during precision grip, Hand function was measured by means of neurological examination, functional hand-grips and dexterity, Brain lesions were identified by series of ultrasound and MRI scans. Normally, the fingertip forces are applied to the object in the initial phase of the lift in an invariant force co-ordination pattern (i.e. grip-lift synergy), in which the grip and load forces are initiated simultaneously and increase in parallel with unimodal force rate trajectories. A majority of children with unilateral brain lesions had not developed the force co-ordination pattern typical for their age, but produced an immature or a pathological pattern. The developmental level of the grip-lift synergy was determined and quantified according to criteria derived from earlier studies on normally developed children, There was a clear relationship between the developmental level of the grip-lift synergy and impaired dexterity, indicating that proper development of the force co-ordination pattern is important for skilled hand function, The grip-lift synergy correlated with the total extent of lesions in the contralateral cortex and white matter and with lesions in the thalamus/basal ganglia, while no correlation was found for isolated cortical lesions. The results suggest that the neural circuits involved in the control of the precision grip are organized in a parallel and distributed system in the hemispheres, and that the basal ganglia are important during the formation of these circuits. Perinatal lesions in specific cortical motor areas may be compensated for by circuits elsewhere in the grip-lift motor system, while large lesions exclude this possibility.;"Karolinska Inst, Dept Woman & Child Hlth, Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Aix Marseille 1, CNRS, Lab Neurobiol Integrat & Adaptat, Marseille, France; Hammersmith Hosp, Dept Paediat, London, England";"Karolinska Institutet; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Imperial College London";Forssberg, H (corresponding author), Karolinska Hosp, Astrid Lindgren Hosp, Motorik Lab, S-17176 Stockholm, Sweden.;hansf@child.ks.se;Forssberg, Hans/A-2944-2009;Forssberg, Hans/0000-0003-2069-6618;;;;;74;78;78;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;JUN;1999;122;;6;;;;1157;1168;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/122.6.1157;;;12;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;214GQ;10356067;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000081320600014;View Full Record in Web of Science

Within this scheme, output compartments of V1, such as the cytochrome oxidase(CO) rich blobs in cortical layer III, synthesize new output pathways appropriate for the next steps in visual analysis. Our chief aim in this study was to examine and compare the synaptic arrangements and neurochemistry of elements involving direct lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input from the K pathway with those involving indirect LGN input from the M and P pathways arriving from cortical layer IV. Geniculocortical K axons were labeled via iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into the LGN and intracortical layer IV axons (indirect P and M pathways to the CO-blobs) were labeled by iontophoretic injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into layer IV. The neurochemical content of both pre-and postsynaptic profiles was identified by postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Sizes of pre- and postsynaptic elements were quantified by using an image analysis system, BioQuant IV. Our chief finding is that K LGN axons and layer IV axons (indirect input from M and P pathways) exhibit different synaptic relationships to CO blob cells. Specifically, our results show that within the CO blobs: 1) all K cell axons contain glutamate, and the vast majority of layer IV axons contain glutamate with only 5% containing GABA; 2) K axons terminate mainly on dendritic spines of glutamatergic cells, while layer IV axons terminate mainly on dendritic shafts of glutamatergic cells; 3) K axons have larger boutons and contact larger postsynaptic dendrites, which suggests that they synapse closer to the cell body within the CO blobs than do layer IV axons. Taken together, these results suggest that each input pathway to the CO blobs uses a different strategy to contribute to the processing of visual information within these compartments.

The present study was conducted to reveal the projection sites of IL and PL of the monkey. Macaca fuscata, using biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer.

A few scattered terminals were observed in the perifornical nucleus of the hypothalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta. PL and area 24 were characterized by projections to the entorhinal (Ent) and piriform (Pir) cortex as well as to the magnocellular part of the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus (VAmc). The morphology of the terminal arborization in each nuclei was different in appearance, perhaps reflecting the synaptic interaction between the nerve terminals and postsynaptic dendrites. PL projected uniquely to Ent. Pir and VAmc and IL projected uniquely to TPa-g, MS, IAM, CeM, MDpc, PF, PBI and LC. IL projected more strongly than PL to the shell of Acb, amygdaloid nuclei, PV, TM, VTA and PAGdl. The present results support the hypothesis that IL is a major cortical autonomic motor area and PL integrates limbic and autonomic inputs in the primate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In most experiments, portions of auditory cortex were first explored with microelectrodes, neurons were characterized as responsive or not to auditory stimuli, and best frequencies were determined whenever possible. Most recordings were in cortex previously designated as primary (A-I) and rostral (R) auditory fields (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 171:111, '77) and in a newly defined rostrotemporal field (RT) located rostral to R. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent tracers were placed in electrophysiologically identified locations of A-1, R, and RT; the posterolateral (PL) and anterolateral (AL) divisions of a narrow belt of auditory cortex lateral and adjacent to A-I and R; cortex of the superior temporal gyrus lateral and rostrolateral to PL and AL; and regions of prefrontal cortex that receive inputs from auditory cortex. There were several major findings: 1. Best frequencies were most clearly determined for neurons within a densely myelinated strip of cortex on the lower bank and lip of the lateral sulcus. We divided this strip into three fields, A-I, R, and RT, although an alternative interpretation that A-1 and R are parts of a single field remains tenable. In some cases, isofrequency contours appeared to continue uninterrupted across fields A-I and R, with lower frequencies represented laterally and higher frequencies represented deeper in the sulcus. In other cases, there was a tendency for high frequencies to be represented caudally and medially, and low frequencies laterally in A-1 and rostrally in R, with partial discontinuity in the isofrequency contours. A reversal of the tonotopic gradient appeared in RT with a common low-frequency representation at the caudal border with R, and progressively higher frequencies encountered rostrally. Of the three fields, A-I appears slightly more myelinated than R, and RT slightly less than R. The distinctiveness of the three fields is further demonstrated by the patterns of connections. In particular, A-I and RT are both interconnected with R, but not with each other. Connections between A-1 and R are between tonotopically matched locations. 2. A narrow 2-3 mm wide band of cortex lateral to A-I, R, and RT was also responsive to auditory stimuli, but typically neurons were more difficult to activate, and best frequencies were more difficult to determine. No distinctions in myeloarchitecture or CO activity were obvious. Nevertheless, regions roughly corresponding to previously distinguished PL and AL divisions of the belt cortex (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 17 1:111, '77) were interconnected. Both PL and AL were connected with R, but PL was connected with A-I while AL was connected with RT. We also denoted a lateral rostrotemporal zone lateral to RT, with inputs from R, RT, and cortex rostral to RT. 3. Another proposed subdivision is CM, a moderately myelinated area medial to A-I that is somewhat smaller than the CM of Imig et al. ('77). CM has connections with A-I, R, PL, and AL. Other parts of the caudal, medial, and rostral belt cortex have auditory connections either from the core areas or other parts of the belt, so that overall there appear to be seven or more fields, but the exact number and boundaries remain uncertain. 4. Patterns of connections also implicate cortex lateral and laterorostral to the belt in auditory function. Cortex lateral to PL interconnects with PL and cortex lateral to AL, and this cortex and the cortex lateral and rostral to the belt have inputs from the auditory thalamus. 5. PL, AL and cortex lateral to these fields connect with cortex rostromedial to the frontal eye field. A-I, R, and RT do not directly connect with prefrontal cortex. 6. In the thalamus, the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex (MGV) projects to A-I, R, RT, and possibly weakly to PL and AL. The projections to different tonotopic locations in A-I and R suggest that low frequencies are represented caudoventrally and high frequencies rostrodorsally in MGV. The medial or magnocellular division (MGM) has more widespread projections to auditory cortex, including A-I, R, AL, and the lateral rostral temporal area (LRT). Although less precise than those of MGV, projections to A-I from MGM tend to be topographically organized with neurons projecting to high-frequency targets distributed dorsal to neurons projecting to low-frequency targets. The dorsal division, MGD, projects to R, RT, AL, and LRT, with more rostral fields receiving projections from the more caudal regions of MGD. The suprageniculate and limitans nuclei, as well as the medial pulvinar, also contribute to auditory fields outside the core areas A-I, R, and RT. 7. A-I, R, and RT project to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CN), with A-I projections extending into the laminated portion of the CN. Other parts of the auditory cortex, including AL and rostrolateral temporal cortex, project to the dorsal cortex (DC) and external nucleus (EN).";;;MOREL, A (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240, USA.;;;;"NIDCD NIH HHS [NIDCD-00922] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-16446] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;85;173;175;0;2;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

The next advance was the development of well-tolerated intracerebral stimulation with reversible effects. The quality of the results depends on optimal definition of the stimulation target. Optimally, the surgical protocol includes stereotaxic ventriculography to identify targets followed by electrical activity recordings of the structures crossed by the electrode. Finally, a minute study of the stimulation effects is performed under sterotaxic control while the patient is awake. Parkinson's diseases: Indications for thalamic stimulation in Parkinson's disease have given way to subthalamic stimulation which improves tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity simultaneously. This result confirms the implication of the subthalamic nucleus in the pathogenesis of Parkinson syndromes. The palladium may be stimulated in Parkinson's patients with major iatrogenic involuntary movements. Essential tremor: Thalamic stimulation is indicated for essential tremor.

These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (''sensorimotor striatum'') and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (''associative striatum'') and the ventral striatum (''limbic striatum''), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.

Using multi-electrode arrays positioned in cat V1 and a broadband stimulus, we show that there is also a distinct class with positive-spiking (PS) waveforms. PS units were associated mainly with non-oriented receptive fields while RS and FS units had orientation-selective receptive fields. We suggest that PS units are recordings of axons originating from the thalamus. This conclusion was reinforced by our finding that we could record PS units after cortical silencing, but not record RS and FS units. The importance of our findings is that we were able to correlate spike shapes with receptive field characteristics with high precision using multi-electrode extracellular recording techniques. This allows considerable increases in the amount of information that can be extracted from future cortical experiments. Extracellular spike waveforms from recordings in the visual cortex have been classified into either regular-spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS) units. While both these types of spike waveforms are negative-dominant, we show that there are also distinct classes of spike waveforms in visual Area 17/18 (V1) of anaesthetised cats with positive-dominant waveforms, which are not regularly reported. The spatial receptive fields (RFs) of these different spike waveform types were estimated, which objectively revealed the existence of oriented and non-oriented RFs. We found that units with positive-dominant spikes, which have been associated with recordings from axons in the literature, had mostly non-oriented RFs (84%), which are similar to the centre-surround RFs observed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Thus, we hypothesise that these positive-dominant waveforms may be recordings from dLGN afferents. We recorded from V1 before and after the application of muscimol (a cortical silencer) and found that the positive-dominant spikes (PS) remained while the RS and FS cells did not. We also noted that the PS units had spiking characteristics normally associated with dLGN units (i.e. higher response spike rates, lower response latencies and higher proportion of burst spikes). Our findings show quantitatively that it is possible to correlate the RF properties of cortical neurons with particular spike waveforms. This has implications for how extracellular recordings should be interpreted and complex experiments can now be contemplated that would have been very challenging previously, such as assessing the feedforward connectivity between brain areas in the same location of cortical tissue.;"[Sun, Shi H.; Almasi, Ali; Yunzab, Molis; Ibbotson, Michael R.; Meffin, Hamish] Australian Coll Optometry, Natl Vis Res Inst, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Zehra, Syeda; Hicks, Damien G.; Kameneva, Tatiana] Swinburne Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Technol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Hicks, Damien G.] Swinburne Univ, Opt Sci Ctr, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Ibbotson, Michael R.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry & Vis Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Zehra, Syeda; Kameneva, Tatiana; Meffin, Hamish] Univ Melbourne, Dept Biomed Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia";"Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne";Ibbotson, MR (corresponding author), Australian Coll Optometry, Natl Vis Res Inst, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.;mibbotson@nvri.org.au;"Ibbotson, Michael R/C-9305-2009; Hicks, Damien G/B-5042-2015";"Ibbotson, Michael R/0000-0002-3803-6653; Hicks, Damien G/0000-0001-8322-9983; Meffin, Hamish/0000-0003-4307-6841; Sun, Shi Hai/0000-0002-0221-1691";"Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function [CE140100007]; National Health and Medical Research Council [GNT1106390]; Lions Club of Victoria";"Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function(Australian Research Council); National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Lions Club of Victoria";This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function (CE140100007), the National Health and Medical Research Council (GNT1106390), and the Lions Club of Victoria.;;89;11;11;0;8;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-3751;1469-7793;;J PHYSIOL-LONDON;J.

The tasks were (i) self-initiated extension of the right index finger on average once every 3 s, (ii) externally triggered finger extension with the rate yoked to the self-initiated task, and (iii) rest condition with tones presented at a rate yoked with the self-initiated task. For the self-initiated movements, the amplitude of the early and peak BP were lower in Parkinson's disease relative to normals. For the externally triggered movements, the patients and the normals did not differ on any of the measures of cortical negativity prior to movement For both groups, the late and peak BP components, but not the early component, had a lower amplitude in the externally triggered than the self-initiated movements. In normals, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary motor area bilaterally anterior cingulate, the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally the insular cortex bilaterally, the left thalamus and the left putamen, parietal area 40 bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were significantly activated during the self-initiated movements relative to rest. For the normals, greater activation of the right DLPFC during the self-initiated movements was the only area that significantly differentiated them from the externally triggered movements. When Parkinson's disease patients and normals were compared for the self-initiated movements relative to rest, normals showed greater activation of the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, left putamen, left insular cortex, right DLPFC and right parietal area 40. When the groups were compared for the externally triggered movements relative to rest the global pattern of blood pow and rCBF change in the two groups did not differ, confirming the absence of group differences in BPs for the externally triggered movements. During the self-initiated movements, the lower amplitude of the early BP in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the underactivation of the supplementary motor area relative to normals support the premises that (i) the supplementary motor area contributes to the early BT: and (ii) the deficit in self-initiated movements in Parkinson's disease is due to supplementary motor area underactivation. The DLPFC is activated in situations requiring non-routine decision making as in the self-initiated movements.;"UCL NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, NEUROL INST, DEPT CLIN NEUROL, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND; HAMMERSMITH HOSP, MRC, CYCLOTRON UNIT, LONDON W12 0HS, ENGLAND; UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND";"University of London; University College London; UCL Medical School; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Imperial College London; University of Oxford";JAHANSHAHI, M (corresponding author), UCL NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, MRC, HUMAN MOVEMENT & BALANCE UNIT, QUEEN SQ, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND.;;Brown, Richard G/A-9599-2010;"Brown, Richard G/0000-0001-9021-0172; Brooks, David/0000-0003-2602-2518";Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline;Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);;;82;820;826;2;44;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;;;BRAIN;Brain;AUG;1995;118;;4;;;;913;933;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/118.4.913;;;21;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;RU634;7655888;;;;19.07.23;WOS:A1995RU63400007;View Full Record in Web of Science

By design, the two motor tasks differed in the cognitive processing required, In each trial of immediate pointing, the spatial location of only the most recent target needed to be processed, In each trial of pointing to the previous, instead, while the most recent target was stored in memory for the movement of the next trial, the previous target had to be retrieved from memory to direct the current movement, Limb trajectories were comparable between the two motor tasks in terms of most spatiotemporal parameters examined. Significant rCBF increases were identified using analysis of covariance and t statistics. Compared with visual detection there was activation of primary sensorimotor cortex, ventrolateral precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus in the opercular region, supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, all these sites in the hemisphere (left) contralateral to the moving limb, and cerebellar vermis, during both immediate pointing and pointing to the previous. During immediate pointing there was additional activation of left inferior parietal lobule close to the intraparietal sulcus, and when compared with pointing to the previous, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. During pointing to the previous, instead, there was additional activation of supplementary motor cortex, anterior and midcingulate, and inferior occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere; superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior hippocampus in the right hemisphere; lingual gyri acid cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally; anterior thalamus; and pulvinar. The activation of two partially distinct cerebral networks in these two motor tasks reflects the different nature of signal processing involved. In particular, the specific activation of intraparietal sulcus and prefrontal cortex in immediate pointing appears characteristic of a network for visuospatial working memory. By contrast, the corticolimbic network engaged in pointing to the previous could mediate spatial attention and the sequence of encoding, recoding, and decoding of spatial memories required by a dual task with two competing targets.

In penetrations made into the upper bank of the lateral sulcus in two monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cells were isolated from the second somatosensory cortex (SII). During single-cell recordings, animals performed an active touch task in which they rubbed their fingertips over pairs of gratings differing in groove width and indicated which was the smoother surface. Hand motion and downward applied force were measured and recorded during these strokes. 2. In this survey, 151 penetrations provided observations on 352 cells that responded to passive stimulation of the digits or during performance of the active touch task. Consistent with previous reports, receptive fields (RFs) in SII were large, often multidigit, and frequently included a portion or all of the hand and occasionally the arm. Modality was determined for 92 of 127 fully characterized cells, and included 70 cutaneous, 5 deep, 11 Pacinian corpuscle, and 6 joint cells. Characteristic of SII, modality could not be defined in 35 cells that were unresponsive to passive stimulation or whose responses varied widely over time. 3. Response properties of a subgroup of 79 cells in SII resembled those previously studied in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) using identical procedures. Correlation analysis revealed that 29 of these cells, like a portion of cells in SI, responded to changes in groove width independent of force or velocity. This selectivity could be considered a form of feature specificity. 4. In contrast to SI and VPL, transient responses to the fingertips contacting small elevated metal bars, which demarcated the beginning, middle, and end of strokes across the gratings, were seen in a majority of SII cells (109/127). During contact with bars, 89 cells displayed excitatory responses and 20 cells showed suppressed activity. Twelve cells, which responded to bars in isolation from gratings, provided a possible example of increased stimulus selectivity. 5. Passive stimulation failed to activate 16 cells that responded, in some cases differentially to gratings or force, during the task. Responses of nine other cells demonstrated task-dependent modulation in the form of response reduction or enhancement during selected portions of the stroke. In these same cells, response changes did not occur under comparable stimulus conditions in other portions of the stroke that differed only in behavioral context. These types of selective response modulations, not noted in our previous studies of VPL or SI, suggest that mechanisms regulating sensory inputs may affect SII. 6. Greater stimulus selectivity, larger RFs, loss of modality specificity, and selective modulation observed in SII are discussed in reference to the possibility that they characterize SII as being ''upstream'' in proposed somatosensory hierarchies.;WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);;;;;"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC-00096] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-31005] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;92;92;92;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The development of excitatory activation in the visual cortex was studied in fetal and neonatal cats. During fetal and neonatal life, the immature cerebral cortex (the cortical plate) is sandwiched between two synaptic zones: the marginal zone above, and an area just below the cortical plate, the subplate. The subplate is transient and disappear by approximately 2 mo postnatal. Here we have investigated whether the subplate and the cortical plate receive functional synaptic inputs in the fetus, and when the adultlike pattern of excitatory synaptic input to the cortical plate appears during development. 2. Extracellular field potential recording to electrical stimulation of the optic radiation was performed in slices of cerebral cortex maintained in vitro. Laminar profiles of field potentials were converted by the current-source density (CSD) method to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of neuronal excitation within the subplate and the cortical plate. 3. Between embryonic day 47 (E47) and postnatal day 28 (P28; birth, E65), age-related changes occur in the pattern of synaptic activation of neurons in the cortical plate and the subplate. Early in development, at E47, E57, and P0, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation is most obvious in the subplate, and longer latency (presumably polysynaptic) excitation can be seen in the cortical plate. Synaptic excitation in the subplate is no longer apparent at P21 and P28, a time when cell migration is finally complete and the cortical layers have formed. By contrast, excitation in the cortical plate is prominent in postnatal animals, and the temporal and spatial pattern has changed. 4. The adultlike sequence of synaptic activation in the different cortical layers can be seen by P28. It differs from earlier ages in several respects. First, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation can be detected in cortical layer 4. Second, multisynaptic, long-lasting activation is present in layers 2/3 and 5. 5. Our results show that the subplate zone, known from anatomic studies to be a synaptic neurophil during development, receives functional excitatory inputs from axons that course in the developing white matter. Because the only mature neurons present in this zone are the subplate neurons, we conclude that subplate neurons are the principal, if not the exclusive, recipients of this input. The results suggest further that the excitation in the subplate in turn is relayed to neurons of the cortical plate via axon collaterals of subplate neurons. Thus an intrinsic set of microcircuits is formed in the developing cerebral cortex that exists only transiently during perinatal life and disappears as subplate neurons are eliminated by programmed cell death after birth. 6. Although the ultimate role of these microcircuits in cortical development is unknown, we suggest that subplate neurons, through synaptic function, may act as a crucial temporary link between forming afferent axonal systems from the thalamus and their final targets, the layer 4 cortical neurons.";;;FRIAUF, E (corresponding author), STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL,STANFORD,CA 94305, USA.;;Friauf, Eckhard/D-7529-2012;Friauf, Eckhard/0000-0002-1833-1698;NEI NIH HHS [EY-02858] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;72;138;140;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Intracellular recordings were made from 43 spinothalamic (STT) neurons in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord in anesthetized macaque monkeys. The antidromic responses of these neurons to electrical stimulation of the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus were examined, and orthodromic responses to electrical stimulation of the sural nerve or to mechanical stimulation of hindlimb skin were recorded to study the electrophysiological features of these neurons and their responses to afferent inputs. 2. The resting membrane potential of the neurons ranged from -26 to -70 mV and the antidromic latency from 2.3 to 9.1 ms. Three of the neurons were located in lamina I and were recorded so briefly that only antidromic and spontaneous activity could be studied. The rest of the neurons were located in laminae III-V and were of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) type. 3. The antidromic action potentials recorded in the somas of STT neurons typically showed a fast rising phase and a short initial segment-somadendritic (IS-SD) delay. After repetitive antidromic stimulation, a progressive elongation of the IS-SD delay, widening of the spike, and failure of the SD spike were observed. 4. The afterpotential of the antidromic action potential consisted of a fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP(f)) and sometimes a delayed depolarization (DD) and a slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP(s)). The amplitude and the duration of the AHP(s) were progressively increased when longer trains of stimuli were used. When the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, the amplitude of the AHP(s) decreased, suggesting an involvement of K+ and/or Cl- ions. However, the AHP(s) completely disappeared when the strength of stimulation was adjusted to a level just below the threshold for the axon, suggesting that it was unlikely that recurrent inhibition contributed to the AHP(s). 5. The background activity of 32 STT neurons was analyzed. The membrane potential at which spikes were triggered in these neurons was around -42 mV. The width and the rise time of the spontaneous spikes were shorter than those of antidromic action potentials, although the maximum rate of rise was similar. The heights of the spontaneous spikes were slightly shorter than those of antidromic action potentials. 6. Three types of background activity have been observed. One type had a very low average spontaneous rate with a bursting firing pattern, consisting of a few spikes superimposed on a depolarization. This type of activity was seen mostly in lamina I neurons. The second type of activity had moderate to high spontaneous rate with a fairly constant interval between spikes. The slowly rising membrane potential between each pair of spikes resembled a pacemaker potential. The third type of activity was a mixture of the previous two. 7. The background firing rates of neurons recorded both extracellularly and intracellularly were not significantly different. Linear correlation analysis showed that the resting membrane potential recorded intracellularly was highly correlated with the height and the width of the antidromic action potential, but was not correlated with the background firing rate of STT neurons recorded intracellularly. 8. Electrical stimulation of the sural nerve evoked depolarizations and discharges in 35 STT neurons tested. Judged by the threshold and the latency of the evoked activity, three components could be distinguished corresponding to A-beta-, A-delta-, and C-afferent inputs. These depolarizations were all excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), because the amplitude of the evoked depolarization was increased (or decreased) when the membrane potential was artifically hyperpolarized (or depolarized). 9. The threshold for EPSPs evoked by A-delta-input (A-delta-EPSPs) was about 5 times the threshold (5T) for the EPSPS evoked by A-beta-input (A-beta-EPSPs). In most cases, the A-delta-EPSPs could be separated from the A-beta-EPSPs by a small dip in the membrane potential and a discontinuation of spike discharges at that time. Furthermore, the membrane conductance increased more during the A-beta-EPSPs than during the A-delta-EPSPs, judging by the amplitudes of the spikes superimposed on the EPSPs. The latency of the potentials evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded in the dorsal horn indicated that at least some of the A-beta- and A-delta-EPSPs were evoked by monosynaptic input. 10. In 28 of 35 neurons, EPSPs evoked by C-afferent input (C-EPSPs) were recorded after single shock stimulation of the sural nerve. The threshold for the C-EPSPs was approximately 100T, and stronger stimuli evoked larger responses. 11. Repetitive stimulation (2 Hz) of the sural nerve was used to study the C-EPSPs in 13 STT neurons. Some neurons displayed a very synchronized C-EPSP pattern with a reliable latency, whereas some neurons had an unsynchronized or a mixed response pattern. Both incremental increases (wind-up) or decreases (wind-down) of the C-EPSP were observed during repetitive stimulation. In the case of wind-up of the C-EPSP, there was concurrently a wind-down of the A-afferent-evoked response in some neurons and a wind-up in other neurons. During repetitive stimulation, the membrane potential of the neurons recorded did not show any significant change. 12. Hyperpolarizations followed the excitation of some STT neurons by A- or C-afferent inputs. The amplitude of these hyperpolarizations was smaller when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, suggesting that these potentials were inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). On the basis of the latency and other observations, the IPSPs were more likely to be evoked by small afferent (A-delta- and C-fibers) inputs than by A-beta-afferents. 13. Mechanical stimulation has been used to observe the pattern of EPSPs underlying evoked discharges in 3 STT neurons. Nociceptive stimuli, including pinching and squeezing, evoked larger EPSPs and a higher rate of discharge than did innocuous stimuli, such as brushing.;"UNIV TEXAS,MED BRANCH,INST MARINE BIOMED,200 UNIV BLVD,GALVESTON,TX 77550; UNIV TEXAS,MED BRANCH,DEPT ANAT & NEUROSCI,GALVESTON,TX 77550";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston";;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-11255, NS-09743] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;83;23;23;0;1;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Here we investigated, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the functional significance of these pathways in the blindsight subject GY, in whom they were first demonstrated. We show that TMS applied over the extrastriate area V5/MT+ in GY's damaged hemisphere modulates the appearance of phosphenes induced from V1 in the normal hemisphere. In contrast, in neurologically normal control subjects, TMS applied over V5/MT+ never influenced the phosphenes induced from V1 in the other hemisphere.

Key findings include: (1) Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) area 32 has dorsal and ventral divisions. (2) Area 33 is part of ACC. (3) Midcingulate cortex (MCC) has anterior and posterior divisions and this was verified with extensive quantitative analysis and a horizontal series of sections. (4) NeuN, also known as Fox-3, is not limited to somata and formed nodules, granular clusters and striations in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. (5) Area 30 forms a complex of anterior and posterior parts with further medial and lateral divisions. (6) Area 29b has two divisions and occupies substantially more volume than in rat. (7) Area 29a begins with a subsplenial component and extends relatively further caudal than in rat. As similar areal designations are often used among species, direct comparisons were made of rabbit areas with those in rat and monkey. The dichotomy of MCC is of particular interest to studies of pain as anterior MCC is most frequently activated in human acute pain studies and the rabbit can be used to study this subregion. Finally, the area 30 complex is not primarily dysgranular as in rat and is more differentiated than in any other mammal including human. The large and highly differentiated rabbit cingulate cortex provides a unique model for assessing cingulate cortex, pain processing and RNA splicing functions.;"[Vogt, Brent A.] Cingulum Neurosci Inst, Manlius, NY 13104 USA; [Vogt, Brent A.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA";Boston University;"Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Cingulum Neurosci Inst, Manlius, NY 13104 USA.;Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA.";bvogt@twcny.rr.com;Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015;Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410;Cingulum Neurosciences Institute;Cingulum Neurosciences Institute;I thank Dr. Robert W.

When most humans learn a new motor skill with one hand, this process results in performance improvements in the opposite hand as well [3-6]. Despite the obvious adaptive advantage of such intermanual transfer, there is no direct evidence identifying the neural substrates of this form of skill acquisition [7-9]. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain regions activated during intermanual transfer of a learned sequence of finger movements. First, we found that the supplementary motor area (SMA) has more activity when a skill has transferred well than when it has transferred poorly. Second, we found that fMRI activity in the ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus correlated with successful future intermanual transfer, whereas activity in the ventrolateral anterior thalamic nucleus correlated with past intermanual transfer. Third, we found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the SMA blocked intermanual transfer without affecting skill acquisition. These findings provide direct evidence for an SMA-based mechanism that supports intermanual transfer of motor-skill learning.;"NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect & Stroke, Neurorehabil Clin, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Lab Syst Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); University of Virginia";Cohen, LG (corresponding author), NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect & Stroke, Neurorehabil Clin, NIH, 10 Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;cohenl@ninds.nih.gov;;Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907;Intramural NIH HHS Funding Source: Medline;Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);;;34;104;105;0;17;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0960-9822;;;CURR BIOL;Curr.

Recently, we found that the cortical and perceptual changes induced by repetitive somatosensory stimulation (RSS) at a finger transfer to the face. However, whether such cross-border changes are specific to the face remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether RSS-induced acuity changes at the finger can also transfer to the forearm, which is the body part represented on the other side of the hand representation. Our results confirmed the transfer of tactile learning from the stimulated finger to the lip, but no significant changes were observed at the forearm. A second experiment revealed that the same regions on the forearm exhibited improved tactile acuity when RSS was applied there, excluding the possibility of low plastic ability at the arm representation. This provides also the first evidence that RSS can be efficient on body parts other than the hand. These results suggest that RSS-induced tactile learning transfers preferentially from the hand to the face rather than to the forearm. This specificity could arise from a stronger functional connectivity between the cortical hand and face representations, reflecting a fundamental coupling between these body parts.;"[Muret, Dollyane; Dinse, Hubert R.] Ruhr Univ, Inst Neuroinformat, Neural Plast Lab, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Muret, Dollyane; Dinse, Hubert R.] BG Univ, Hosp Bergmannsheil, Dept Neurol, D-44789 Bochum, Germany";"Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum";"Muret, D (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ, Inst Neuroinformat, Neural Plast Lab, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.;Muret, D (corresponding author), BG Univ, Hosp Bergmannsheil, Dept Neurol, D-44789 Bochum, Germany.";dollyane.muret@gmail.com;Muret, Dollyane/AAV-5084-2021;"Muret, Dollyane/0000-0002-2626-654X; dinse, hubert/0000-0001-9024-0451";"Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DI 334/20-1]";"Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))";This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DI 334/20-1).;;50;5;5;1;3;NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;2045-2322;;;SCI REP-UK;Sci Rep;Aug 06;2018;8;;;;;;;;11752;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-30183-5;;;8;Multidisciplinary Sciences;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";Science & Technology - Other Topics;GP3VG;30082760;gold, Green Published;;;19.07.23;WOS:000440782000039;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is widely believed that this function extends to stopping cognitive processes as well. Consistent with this, mounting evidence establishes the role of the right lateral prefrontal cortex in a clear case of cognitive control: retrieval suppression. Retrieval suppression refers to the ability to intentionally stop the retrieval process that arises when a reminder to a memory appears. Functional imaging data indicate that retrieval suppression involves top-down modulation of hippocampal activity by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but the anatomical pathways supporting this inhibitory modulation remain unclear. Here we bridge this gap by integrating key findings about retrieval suppression observed through functional imaging with a detailed consideration of relevant anatomical pathways observed in non-human primates. Focusing selectively on the potential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, we develop two hypotheses about the pathways mediating interactions between lateral prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobes during suppression, and their cellular targets: the entorhinal gating hypothesis, and thalamo-hippocampal modulation via the nucleus reuniens. We hypothesize that whereas entorhinal gating is well situated to stop retrieval proactively, thalamo-hippocampal modulation may interrupt an ongoing act of retrieval reactively. Isolating the pathways that underlie retrieval suppression holds the potential to advance our understanding of a range of psychiatric disorders characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts. More broadly, an anatomical account of retrieval suppression would provide a key model system for understanding inhibitory control over cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

During a categorization task, the majority of pulvinar responses did not correlate with any 'perceptual content'. During an opt-out task, pulvinar responses decreased when monkeys chose 'escape' options, suggesting less confidence in their perceptual categorization. Functional silencing of the pulvinar increased monkeys' escape choices in the opt-out task without affecting categorization performance; this effect was specific to the contralateral visual target.

Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.;"Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10012 USA";"Universite de Montreal; New York University";Thivierge, JP (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Phys, CP 6128 Succ,Centerville, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.;jean-philippe.thivierge@umontreal.ca;;;;;;;68;99;100;0;18;ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON;LONDON;84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND;0166-2236;;;TRENDS NEUROSCI;Trends Neurosci.;JUN;2007;30;6;;;;;251;259;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2007.04.004;;;9;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;179GN;17462748;;;;19.07.23;WOS:000247277800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Moving-bar visual stimuli of different extension, stimuli moving in different directions, the impact of non-specific cortical activation upon synchronous oscillation, and the frequency content of EEG associated with synchrony were considered. The magnitude of zero lag synchrony was primarily accounted for by the properties of the eigenmodes of the travelling local field potential superposition waves generated by inputs to the cortex, largely independent of the oscillation properties and associated spectral content. Approximation of the differences in cross-correlation observed with differently moving bar stimuli, and of the impact of cortical activation, required added assumptions on (a) spatial coherence of efferent volleys al-ising from parts of a single stimulus object and (b) the presence of low-amplitude diffuse held noise, with enhancement of cortical signal/noise ratio with respect to the spatially coherent inputs, at higher levels of cortical activation. Synchrony appears to be a ubiquitous property of cortex-like delay networks.

Full definition of these areas will require a combination of functional and histological methods but, by using six complementary histological methods, of which most have been used in the monkey, we provide a clearer description of these areas. The primary auditory area was located on the posteromedial two-thirds of the first transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyrus and was distinguished by a dense band of cytochrome oxidase activity in layer IV and the base of layer III, as well as a relatively thick, pale layer V and VI. Layers V and VI together made up 40% of the cortical thickness. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing pyramidal cells were sparsely distributed within the primary auditory area. The anterolateral third of Heschl's gyrus did not have a clear band of high cytochrome oxidase activity but contained a moderately high density of AChE-containing pyramidal cells and thus appeared to be part of the auditory belt. Within Heschl's sulcus there was a third area, which had a band of high cytochrome oxidase activity and bands of high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and AChE activity in layer IV. This area appeared to be part of the auditory core. Thus the use of staining methods for cytochrome oxidase, AChE and parvalbumin provided additional information which allowed a clearer definition of auditory areas than Nissl or myelin staining alone. Our results suggest that there are two core areas surrounded by at least six belt areas in the human auditory region.;"Univ Aberdeen, Marischal Coll, Dept Biomed Sci, Aberdeen AB9 1AS, Scotland; MRC, Inst Hearing Res, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England";University of Aberdeen;Wallace, MN (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Marischal Coll, Dept Biomed Sci, Aberdeen AB9 1AS, Scotland.;;Wallace, Mark/ABC-1573-2020;"Wallace, Mark/0000-0001-6894-4903; Palmer, Alan/0000-0001-5893-4525";;;;;40;127;128;0;2;SPRINGER-VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

This study investigates the potential roles of feedback interactions in neural information processing. We consider a two-layer continuous attractor neural network (CANN), in which neurons in the first layer receive feedback inputs from those in the second one. By utilizing the intrinsic property of a CANN, we use a projection method to reduce the dimensionality of the network dynamics significantly. The simplified dynamics allows us to elucidate the effects of feedback modulation analytically. We find that positive feedback enhances the stability of the network state, leading to an improved population decoding performance, whereas negative feedback increases the mobility of the network state, inducing spontaneously moving bumps. For strong, negative feedback interaction, the network response to a moving stimulus can lead the actual stimulus position, achieving an anticipative behavior. The biological implications of these findings are discussed. The simulation results agree well with our theoretical analysis.;"[Zhang, Wenhao; Wu, Si] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenhao; Wu, Si] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS; Beijing Normal University";Wu, S (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;"whzhang@ion.ac.cn; wusi@bnu.edu.cn";Zhang, Wen-Hao/AAO-4592-2021;Zhang, Wen-Hao/0000-0001-7641-5024;"973 program of China [2011CBA00406]; National Foundation of Natural Science of China [91132702]";"973 program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Foundation of Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))";We acknowledge valuable discussions with K.

Here we tested, in rats, the hypothesis that BLA is critical for conditioned reinforcer devaluation during the period when the primary reinforcer (food) is being devalued (by feeding it to satiety), but not thereafter for guiding behavioral choices. We used a spatially independent task that used two visual cues, each predicting one of two foods. An instrumental action (lever press) was required for reinforcer delivery. After training, rats received BLA or sham lesions, or cannulae implanted in BLA. Under control conditions (sham lesions, saline infusions), devaluation of one food significantly decreased responding to the cue associated with that food, when both cues were presented simultaneously during extinction. BLA lesions impaired this devaluation effect. Transient inactivation of BLA by microinfusion of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A agonist muscimol resulted in an impairment only when BLA was inactivated during satiation. When muscimol was infused after satiation and therefore, BLA was inactivated only during the choice test, rats showed no impairment. Thus, BLA is necessary for registering or updating cues to reflect updated reinforcer values, but not for guiding choices once the value has been updated. Our results are the first to describe the contribution of rat BLA to specific components of reinforcer devaluation and are the first to show impairment in reinforcer devaluation following transient inactivation in the rat.;"[West, Elizabeth A.; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Murnen, Alice T.; McCue, David L.; Gale, Karen; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [West, Elizabeth A.; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Gale, Karen; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Interdisciplinary Program Neurosci, Washington, DC 20007 USA";"Georgetown University; Georgetown University";Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pharmacol, 3900 Reservoir Rd NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA.;malkoval@georgetown.edu;"Forcelli, Patrick/G-6970-2012; West, Elizabeth/AIE-9970-2022";"West, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2013-5995; Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X";"National Institute on Drug Abuse [F31DA026705, T32DA007291]; National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke [F31NS066822, T32NS04123]; Epilepsy Foundation Fellowship [EFA123098]; Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; Georgetown University Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Program; Department of Pharmacology Physiology";"National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Epilepsy Foundation Fellowship; Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; Georgetown University Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Program; Department of Pharmacology Physiology";The work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Grants F31DA026705 (Elizabeth A.

Using simulations of cerebral cortex and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we show patterns of zero-lag synchronisation (associated with empirically realistic spectral content) can arise from both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. For low levels of activation, we show the synchronous field is described by the eigenmodes of the resultant damped wave activity. The first and second spatial eigenmodes (which capture most of the signal variance) arise from the even and odd components of the independent input signals. The pattern of zero-lag synchronisation can be accounted for by the relative dominance of the first mode over the second, in the near-field of the inputs. The simulated cortical surface can act as a few millisecond response coincidence detector for concurrent, but uncorrelated, inputs. As cortical activation levels are increased, local damped oscillations in the gamma band undergo a transition to highly nonlinear undamped activity with 40 Hz dominant frequency. This is associated with locking between active sites and spatially segregated phase patterns. The damped wave synchronisation and the locked nonlinear oscillations may combine to permit fast representation of multiple patterns of activity within the same field of neurons.";"Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Auckland, Sch Med, Liggins Inst, Auckland, New Zealand; Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Astrophys & Comp, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia";"University of Sydney; University of Auckland; Swinburne University of Technology";Chapman, CL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat F07, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;;;"Bourke, Paul/0000-0002-0325-882X; Chapman, Clare/0000-0002-1306-5415";;;;;68;27;29;0;1;SPRINGER-VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA;0303-6812;;;J MATH BIOL;J.

It is believed that anatomical connectivity can be used to probe hierarchical organization, however direct characterization of this principle in-vivo within humans remains elusive. Here, we use resting-state functional connectivity as a complement to anatomical connectivity to investigate topographical principles of human S1. We employ a novel approach to examine mesoscopic variations of functional connectivity, and demonstrate a topographic organisation spanning the region's hierarchical axis that strongly correlates with underlying microstructure while tracing along architectonic Brodmann areas. Our findings characterize anatomical hierarchy of S1 as a 'continuous spectrum' with evidence supporting a functional boundary between areas 3b and 1. The identification of this topography bridges the gap between structure and connectivity, and may be used to help further current understanding of sensorimotor deficits.;"[Ngo, Geoffrey N.; Menon, Ravi S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Med Biophys, London, ON, Canada; [Haak, Koen, V; Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Univ Oxford, Wellcome Ctr Integrat Neuroimaging WIN FMRIB, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Menon, Ravi S.] Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Funct & Metab Mapping, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada";"Western University (University of Western Ontario); Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Oxford; Western University (University of Western Ontario)";Menon, RS (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Funct & Metab Mapping, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada.;rmenon@robarts.ca;"Menon, Ravi/GQY-7621-2022; Beckmann, Christian F./E-6374-2012; Haak, Koen/AAM-5500-2020; Menon, Ravi S/K-5500-2013; Haak, Koen V/G-6417-2018";"Menon, Ravi/0000-0002-7916-0263; Beckmann, Christian F./0000-0002-3373-3193; Haak, Koen/0000-0001-9309-1906; Menon, Ravi S/0000-0002-7916-0263; Haak, Koen V/0000-0001-9309-1906";"CIHR Foundation Scheme grant [FDN 148453]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [NWOVeni 016.171.068, NWOVidi 864.12.003]; Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award [215573/Z/19/Z]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Gravitation Programme Language in Interaction [024.001.006]; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers [1U54MH091657]";"CIHR Foundation Scheme grant(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award(Wellcome Trust); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research under the Gravitation Programme Language in Interaction; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Clinical Center (CC))";"This work was supported by CIHR Foundation Scheme grant FDN 148453 (R.S.M.) , Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWOVeni 016.171.068 to K.V.H. and NWOVidi 864.12.003 to C.F.B.) and the Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award [215573/Z/19/Z] .

In the superior colliculus, these calcium-binding proteins show different distribution patterns throughout the layers. After reaction for calretinin one observes a heavy staining of the neuropil with few labeled cells in superficial layers, a greater number of large and medium-sized cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and small neurons in deep layers. The reaction for calbindin revealed a strong staining of neuropil with a large number of small and well stained cells, mainly in the upper half of the stratum griseum superficiale. Intermediate layers were more weakly stained and depicted few neurons. There were few immunopositive cells and little neuropil staining in deep layers. The reaction for parvalbumin showed small and medium-sized neurons in the superficial layers, a predominance of large stellate cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and medium-sized cells in the deep layers. In the lateral geniculate nucleus of Cebus, parvalbumin is found in the cells of both the P and M pathways, whereas calbindin is mainly found in the interlaminar and S layers, which are part of the third visual pathway. Calretinin was only found in cells located in layer S. This pattern is similar to that observed in Macaca, showing that these calcium-binding proteins reveal different components of the parallel visual pathways both in New and Old World monkeys.

The pulvinar forms extensive connections with striate and extrastriate cortical areas, but the impact of these connections on cortical circuits has not previously been directly tested. Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and in vitro physiological techniques in male and female mice, we show that pulvinocortical terminals are densely distributed in the extrastriate cortex where they form synaptic connections with spines and small-diameter dendrites. Optogenetic activation of these synapses in vitro evoked large excitatory postsynaptic responses in the majority of pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and interneurons within the extrastriate cortex. However, specificity in pulvinar targeting was revealed when recordings were targeted to projection neuron subtypes. The neurons most responsive to pulvinar input were those that project to the striatum and amygdala (76% responsive) or V1 (55%), whereas neurons that project to the superior colliculus were rarely responsive (6%). Because the pulvinar also projects directly to the striatum and amygdala, these results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement.

Methods: Motor excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques and electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. Motor function was evaluated by the Nine-Hole-Peg Test and measurement of hand grip strength. The affected side was compared with the non-lesioned side and with an age-matched control group. Results: Patients had a loss of inhibition and an increase of facilitation in the motor cortex of the affected side. The silent period was prolonged and motor function was impaired on the affected side. Conclusions: A thalamic lesion can modulate motor cortical excitability. Significance: This study suggests that, under normal conditions, somatosensory afferents influence inhibitory and excitatory properties in the motor cortex.

We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) during tonic painful heat stimulation to test the hypothesis of increases in both glutamate and GABA, two neurotransmitters with a key role in pain processing. Using a 3 T MR scanner, we acquired spectra from the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in 13 healthy right-handed subjects at rest and during painful heat Stimulation. The Painful stimulus consisted Of a suprathreshold painful tonic heat Pulse, Which was delivered to the right upper leg via a fMRI-compatible Peltier element. Compared to non-painful Stimulation, painful tonic heat was associated with a significant increase in GABA concentrations in the rACC. No changes in glutamate concentrations were detected during noxious stimulation. This study provides the first evidence that GABA is released in the human cerebral cortex during painful stimulation. The results are in line with animal findings on the role of GABA in pain processing and with studies in humans showing analgesic efficacy of GABA-related drugs in clinical pain conditions.

Recent experiments have suggested that alpha band activity originating from the pulvinar coordinates this inter-areal cortical communication. Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring experimental quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.;"[Quax, Silvan; Tiesinga, Paul] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst, Dept Neuroinformat, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jensen, Ole] Univ Birmingham, Ctr Human Brain Hlth, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England";"Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Birmingham";"Quax, S; Tiesinga, P (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst, Dept Neuroinformat, Nijmegen, Netherlands.";"s.quax@donders.ru.nl; p.tiesinga@science.ru.nl";"Quax, Silvan/Q-8683-2018; Jensenq, Ole/D-2120-2010; Tiesinga, Paul/D-1901-2010";"Quax, Silvan/0000-0001-6685-1789; Jensenq, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; ";"Neuroseeker FP7 project [600925]; James S.

Electrical stimulation (500 ms trains) delivered to microelectrode sites evoked movements of reach, defense, and grasp, from distinct zones in M1/PM and PPC, in squirrel and owl monkeys. Tracer injections into M1/PM reach, defense, and grasp zones showed dense connections with M1/PM hand/forelimb representations. The densest inputs outside of frontal cortex were from PPC zones. M1 zones were additionally connected with somatosensory hand/forelimb representations in areas 3a, 3b, and 1 and the somatosensory areas of the upper bank of the lateral sulcus (S2/PV). Injections into PPC zones showed primarily local connections and the densest inputs outside of PPC originated from M1/PM zones. The PPC reach zone also received dense inputs from cortex caudal to PPC, which likely relayed visual information. In contrast, the PPC grasp zone was densely connected with the hand/forelimb representations of areas 3a, 3b, 1, and S2/PV. Thus, the dorsal parietal-frontal network involved in reaching was preferentially connected to visual cortex, whereas the more ventral network involved in grasping received somatosensory inputs.

This operation leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple stimuli.

The strength of bimodal-cell response to a visual stimulus depends on its proximity to the hand. We tested the hypothesis that hand proximity to a visual stimulus would influence unconscious residual vision in the blind field. MB is a 26-year-old man with a dense upper-left quadrantanopia following surgical treatment that severed Meyer's loop, and SB is a 35-year-old man with a dense left hemianopia following childhood meningitis. Testing for hand-assisted blindsight in MB allowed us to evaluate whether phenomena related to hand proximity are dependent on information relayed through the optic radiations. We presented target objects of different sizes to the blind fields of these gentlemen, and asked them to estimate target size with their right hand by adjusting thumb-finger distance or reaching and grasping the object. Concurrently, we varied the location of the resting left hand. In the hand-far condition, the left hand rested on their lap, and in the hand-near condition, it was placed just to the left of the target object. In the hand-far condition, both patients showed no scaling of either size-estimation aperture (SEA) or peak grip aperture PGA) to object size. In the hand-near condition, however, both PGA and SEA were scaled to object size. Additional studies of MB suggest that hand proximity effects cannot be attributed solely to changes in spatial attention. These results imply that if bimodal cells are recruited when the hand is placed nearby the visual target, they must receive information from cortical areas that do not depend on the integrity of the optic radiations.

As to the relay cells in cats' lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), they also have weak but significant orientation bias (OB). It is thus of interest to investigate the fine spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) properties in LGN, compare them with the dynamics of orientation tuning, and examine the dynamic relationship between STRF and orientation sensitivity in LGN. We mapped the STRFs of the LGN neurons in cats with white noise and characterized the dynamics of the orientation tuning by flashing gratings. We found that most of the LGN neurons showed elongated RFs and that the elongation axes were consistent with the preferred orientations. STRFs and the dynamics of orientation tuning were closely correlated temporally: the elongation of RFs and OB emerged, peaked and decayed at the same pace, with unchanged elongation axis of RF and preferred orientation but consistently changing aspect ratio of RF and OB strength across time. Importantly, the above consistency between RF and orientation tuning was not influenced by the ablation of the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, biased orientation tuning emerged 20-30 ms earlier than those in the primary visual cortex. These data demonstrated that similar to the primary visual cortex, the orientation sensitivity was closely reflected by the RF properties in LGN. However, the elongated RF and OB in LGN did not originate from the primary visual cortex feedback. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to establish (a) whether the developmental refinement of FF projections parallels that of feedback (FB) cortical circuits, and (b) whether FF pathways from V1 to different target areas refine with a similar rate. We injected the tracer CTb into V1 of juvenile ferrets, and visualized the pattern of labeled axon terminals in extrastriate cortex.

However, in area Ssy this decline was delayed somewhat, not occurring until after 6 weeks. During this postnatal period, mean interbouton intervals along individual FF axons to all visual areas increased, and we observed a concomitant moderate decrease in axon density in areas 18, 21, and Ssy. These data suggest that FF circuits linking V1 to its main extrastriate targets remodel largely synchronously in the weeks following eye opening, that FF and FB cortical circuits share a broadly similar developmental timecourse, and that postnatal visual experience is critical for the refinement of both FF and FB cortical circuits.;"[Khalil, Reem] Amer Univ Sharjah, Biol Chem & Environm Sci Dept, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Khalil, Reem; Contreras-Ramirez, Violeta; Levitt, Jonathan B.] CUNY, Dept Biol MR526, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Khalil, Reem; Levitt, Jonathan B.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA";"American University of Sharjah; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System";"Levitt, JB (corresponding author), CUNY, Dept Biol MR526, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.;Levitt, JB (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.";jlevitt@ccny.cuny.edu;Khalil, Reem/ABB-8310-2020;Khalil, Reem/0000-0002-2661-5957;"National Center for Research Resources [2G12RR03060-26A1]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities from the National Institutes of Health [8G12MD007603-27]; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah";"National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities from the National Institutes of Health; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah";"This work was supported by grants from the National Center for Research Resources (2G12RR03060-26A1); The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (8G12MD007603-27) from the National Institutes of Health; Professional Staff Congress-City University of New York (PSC-CUNY); and Faculty Research Grant (FRG II) American University of Sharjah.";;78;6;6;0;7;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

All cortical sites responding to specific noxious inputs also responded to nonnoxious stimuli, while the reverse was not always true. Evoked responses in S1 area 3b were systematic for nonnoxious inputs, but seen in only half of cases after nociceptive stimulation. Nociceptive responses were systematically recorded when electrode tracks reached the crown of the postcentral gyrus, consistent with an origin in somatosensory areas 1-2. Sites in the precentral cortex also exhibited noxious and nonnoxious responses with phase reversals indicating a local origin in area 4 (M1). We conclude that a representation of thermal nociceptive information does exist in human S1, although to a much lesser extent than the nonnociceptive one. Notably, area 3b, which responds massively to nonnoxious A beta activation was less involved in the processing of noxious heat. S1 and M1 responses to noxious heat occurred at latencies comparable to those observed in the supra-sylvian opercular region of the same patients, suggesting a parallel, rather than hierarchical, processing of noxious inputs in S1, M1 and opercular cortex.

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception, often by making the sound seem louder, the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review, we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g., what circuits underlie multisensory convergence), and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g., what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact, it seems that the question is no longer whether low level, putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences, but how.

We report here on the pattern of calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity within these areas. The supratemporal regions of four normal human brains (eight hemispheres) were processed histologically, and serial sections were stained for parvalbumin, calretinin or calbindin. Each calcium-binding protein yielded a specific pattern of labelling, which differed between auditory areas. In AI, defined as area TC [see C. von Economo and L. Horn (1930) Z. Ges. Neurol. Psychiatr., 130 , 678-757], parvalbumin labelling was dark in layer IV; several parvalbumin-positive multipolar neurons were distributed in layers III and IV. Calbindin yielded dark labelling in layers I-III and V; it revealed numerous multipolar and pyramidal neurons in layers II and III. Calretinin labelling was lighter than that of parvalbumin or calbindin in AI; calretinin-positive bipolar and bitufted neurons were present in supragranular layers. In non-primary auditory areas, the intensity of labelling tended to become progressively lighter while moving away from AI, with qualitative differences between the cytoarchitectonically defined areas.

However, direct investigation of the influence of brain circuitry on function has been hindered by the lack of a technique for exploring anatomical connectivity in the in vivo brain. Recent advances in magnetic resonance diffusion imaging have given scientists access to data relating to local white matter architecture and, for the first time, have raised the possibility of in vivo investigations into brain circuitry. This review investigates whether diffusion imaging may be used to identify regions of grey matter that are distinct in their connectional architecture, and whether these connectional differences are reflected either in local cytoarchitecture or in local grey matter function. Establishing a direct relationship between regional boundaries based on diffusion imaging and borders between regions that perform different functions would not only be of great significance when interpreting functional results, but would also provide a first step towards the validation of diffusion-based anatomical connectivity studies.;Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Ctr Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain, Oxford OX3 9DU, England;University of Oxford;Behrens, TEJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Ctr Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging Brain, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.;behrens@fmrib.ox.ac.uk;Jovicich, Jorge/D-2293-2010;"Johansen-Berg, Heidi/0000-0002-4134-9730; Behrens, Timothy/0000-0003-0048-1177";;;;;44;88;88;0;12;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;1471-2970;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

Anatomical studies have delineated multiple areas in and around primary auditory cortex and demonstrated connectivity among these areas, as well as between these areas and the rest of the cortex, including prefrontal cortex. Physiological recordings of auditory neurons have found that species-specific vocalizations are useful in probing the selectivity and potential functions of acoustic neurons. A number of cortical regions contain neurons that are robustly responsive to vocalizations, and some auditory responsive neurons show more selectivity for vocalizations than for other complex sounds. Demonstration of selectivity for vocalizations has prompted the question of which features are encoded by higher-order auditory neurons. Results based on detailed studies of the structure of these vocalizations, as well as the tuning and in formation-coding properties of neurons sensitive to these vocalizations, have begun to provide answers to this question. In future studies, these and other methods may help to define the way in which cells, ensembles, and brain regions process communication sounds. Moreover, the discovery that several nonprimary auditory cortical regions may be multisensory and responsive to vocalizations with corresponding facial gestures may change the way in which we view the processing of communication information by the auditory system.;"[Romanski, Lizabeth M.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Averbeck, Bruno B.] UCL, Sobell Dept Motor Neurosci & Movement Disorders, Inst Neurol, London WC1N 3BG, England";"University of Rochester; University of London; University College London";Romanski, LM (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;Liz_romanski@urmc.rochester.edu;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC004845, R01 DC004845-08] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;113;121;121;0;29;ANNUAL REVIEWS;PALO ALTO;4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA;0147-006X;1545-4126;;ANNU REV NEUROSCI;Annu.

Animal work demonstrates that interactions among these regions are critical for flexible feedback-guided learning, but it remains unknown to what extent such anatomical-functional interactions operate in humans. Here, we use connectivity analyses in both structural and functional MRI to further our understanding of how brain circuits work in conjunction to promote goal-directed behavior. In particular, fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging provides information about anatomical connectivity between brain structures, and functional MRI provides estimates of functional connectivity between structures. We found that, during a feedback-guided reversal learning task, the strength of estimated white matter tracts from the amygdala to the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum predicted both how subjects adapted their behavior following positive and negative feedback, and the functional connectivity (estimated from functional MRI time series) between the amygdala and these regions. In addition, we identified a dissociation between an amygdala-hippocampus circuit that predicted response switching, and an amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex circuit that predicted learning following rule reversals. These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning of amygdala-related brain circuits mediate different aspects of feedback-guided learning behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The removal of this area alone does not cause either paralysis or akinesia. However, the animals were poor at performing a simple learned task in which they had to carry out an arbitrary action: they were taught to raise their arm in order to obtain food in a foodwell below. They were impaired whether they worked in the light or the dark. They were impaired when they had to perform the movements at their own pace, but much less impaired when a tone paced performance. Monkeys with lesions in the anterior cingulate cortex were as impaired as monkeys with medial premotor lesions at performing this task at their own pace. However, monkeys with lateral premotor lesions were less impaired.

An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.;"[Mante, Valerio; Bonin, Vincent; Carandini, Matteo] Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA";The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute;Mante, V (corresponding author), Smith Kettlewell Eye Res Inst, 1318 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.;valerio@monkeybiz.stanford.edu;"Carandini, Matteo/C-1922-2008; Bonin, Vincent/AAQ-3833-2020; Carandini, Matteo/ABD-8296-2021";"Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Carandini, Matteo/0000-0003-4880-7682; Bonin, Vincent/0000-0002-9437-8092";;;;;92;86;86;0;16;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;;;NEURON;Neuron;May 22;2008;58;4;;;;;625;638;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.011;;;14;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;304PD;18498742;Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000256120500015;View Full Record in Web of Science

The averaged rGBF values during innocuous stimuli were subtracted from those during noxious stimuli and statistical parametric maps (SPMs) for the group were computed to identify regions of altered relative rGBF. Finally, single-subject PET images of elevated and reduced rCBF were co-registered with MR images and projected onto reconstructions of the medial surface of the hemisphere. The SPM analysis of the group showed one site with elevated rCBF in the midcingulate cortex and one in the perigenual cortex predominantly contralateral to the side of stimulation. There were bilateral sites of reduced rGBF in the cingulofrontal transitional cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCG). Co-registered PET and MR images for individuals showed that only one case had a single, large region of elevated rCBF, while the others had a number of smaller regions. Six cases had at least one significant elevation of rGBF in the right hemisphere that primarily involved area 24b'; five of these cases also had an elevation in area 32', while the seventh case had elevated rGBF in these areas in the left hemisphere. The rostral site of elevated rCBF in the group was at the border of areas 24/24' and areas 32/32', although most cases had a site of elevation more rostral in the perigenual cingulate cortex. The AGG site of reduced rGBF was in areas 8 and 32 and that in the PCG included much of areas 29/30 in the callosal sulcus, areas 23b and 31 on the cingulate gyral surface and parietal area 7m. The localization of relative rGBF changes suggests different roles for the cingulate cortex in pain processing: (i) elevated rGBF in area 24' may be involved in response selection like nocifensive reflex inhibition; (ii) activation of the perigenual cortex may participate in affective responses to noxious stimuli like suffering associated with pain; and (iii) reduced rCBF in areas 8 and 32 may enhance pain perception in the perigenual cortex, while that in the PGC may disengage visually guided processes.";"HOPE HOSP, RHEUMAT DIS CTR, SALFORD M6 8HD, LANCS, ENGLAND; UNIV MANCHESTER, SALFORD M6 8HD, LANCS, ENGLAND";"N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester";Vogt, BA (corresponding author), WAKE FOREST UNIV, BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED, DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL, MED CTR BLVD, WINSTON SALEM, NC 27157 USA.;;Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015;"Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410; Derbyshire, Stuart/0000-0002-2766-3424; Jones, Anthony/0000-0001-6944-9365";;;;;81;309;322;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.;"[Schaffer, Evan S.; Miller, Kenneth D.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Schaffer, Evan S.; Miller, Kenneth D.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ozeki, Hirofumi; Finn, Ian M.; Ferster, David] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Physiol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA";"Columbia University; Columbia University; Northwestern University";Miller, KD (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.;"ken@neurotheory.columbia.edu; ferster@northwestern.edu";;Schaffer, Evan/0000-0002-8731-4939;"National Institutes of Health [R01 EY04726, R01 EY11001]; JSPS";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)";We thank N.

By employing [F-17]-[CH3F] ([F-17]-fluoromethane) as a radiotracer of blood-flow, we were able to obtain increased sensitivity compared to [O-15]-H2O for both cortical and subcortical structures. The brain areas investigated were left primary motor cortex, right primary visual cortex, and left and right prefrontal areas. We found that each site of stimulation yielded a different pattern of activation/deactivation consistent with its anatomical connectivity. Moreover, we found that TMS of prefrontal and motor cortical areas gave rise to trans-synaptic activation of subcortical circuits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, auditory inputs were shown to suppress activations in visual cortices when presented alone but amplify the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to concurrent visual inputs (and vice versa). This concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation-functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) study applied repetitive TMS trains at no, low, and high intensity over right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and vertex to investigate top-down influences on visual and auditory cortices under 3 sensory contexts: visual, auditory, and no stimulation. IPS-TMS increased activations in auditory cortices irrespective of sensory context as a result of direct and nonspecific auditory TMS side effects. In contrast, IPS-TMS modulated activations in the visual cortex in a state-dependent fashion: it deactivated the visual cortex under no and auditory stimulation but amplified the BOLD response to visual stimulation. However, only the response amplification to visual stimulation was selective for IPS-TMS, while the deactivations observed for IPS- and Vertex-TMS resulted from crossmodal deactivations induced by auditory activity to TMS sounds. TMS to IPS may increase the responses in visual (or auditory) cortices to visual (or auditory) stimulation via a gain control mechanism or crossmodal interactions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that understanding TMS effects on (uni)sensory processing requires a multisensory perspective.;"[Leitao, Joana; Thielscher, Axel; Werner, Sebastian; Pohmann, Rolf; Noppeney, Uta] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Cognit Neuroimaging Grp, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Leitao, Joana; Thielscher, Axel; Werner, Sebastian; Pohmann, Rolf; Noppeney, Uta] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, High Field Magnet Resonance Ctr, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Noppeney, Uta] Univ Birmingham, Computat Neurosci & Cognit Robot Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England";"Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of Birmingham";Leitao, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Cognit Neuroimaging Grp, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.;joana.leitao@tuebingen.mpg.de;"Pohmann, Rolf/B-1122-2010; Leitao, Joana/AAC-7945-2020";"Pohmann, Rolf/0000-0002-6137-9590; Thielscher, Axel/0000-0002-4752-5854; Noppeney, Uta/0000-0002-7697-2290";"Max Planck Society; Lundbeck Foundation [R118-2012-11308] Funding Source: researchfish";"Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); Lundbeck Foundation(Lundbeckfonden)";Max Planck Society.;;84;23;24;1;42;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

This property is generated by a neuronal ring attractor that is updated using rotation velocity cues. The properties and origin of this velocity drive remain, however, unknown. We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.;"[Laurens, Jean; Angelaki, Dora E.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA";Baylor College of Medicine;Laurens, J (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;jean.laurens@gmail.com;;;NIH [R21-NS098146, R01-DC004260];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This study was supported by NIH grants R21-NS098146 and R01-DC004260.;;87;30;30;1;21;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;1097-4199;;NEURON;Neuron;Jan 17;2018;97;2;;;;;275;289;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.020;;;15;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;FS8VE;29346751;Green Accepted, Green Submitted, Bronze;;;19.07.23;WOS:000422692000007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, taste is organized along a neural dimension of nutrients versus toxins, which corresponds to a behavioral dimension of acceptance versus rejection, and to a hedonic dimension of appetitive versus aversive qualities. Reflexive responses; cognitive analyses, and hedonic reactions appear to be managed at different levels of the nervous system. At the first central relay, the nucleus of the solitary tract, somatic reflexes for acceptance or rejection, and autonomic reflexes anticipating digestion are orchestrated. At the second, the parabrachial nucleus of the rodent, associative mechanisms important to the development of conditioned aversions and sodium appetite are manifested. In the thalamic taste relay, gustatory memories associated with non-visceral events may be formed. Primary taste cortex appears to be the site for a cognitive evaluation of gustatory quality and intensity. Finally, a hedonic assessment of the chemical may be made in secondary taste cortex and in the ventral forebrain sites to which it projects. With this assessment comes integration of the gustatory signal with those from other senses, perhaps to create a perception of flavor. Therefore, a sequence that begins with an analysis of the molecular structure of a chemical in the mouth serves to incorporate that gustatory component into an appreciation of flavor, and to participate in the control of motivational processes that guide dietary selection.

Likewise, during natural tactile behaviors, spatially extensive regions of the somatosensory surface are co-activated. The large spatial extent of naturalistic stimulation means that surround suppression, a phenomenon whose neural mechanisms remain a matter of debate, must arise during natural behavior. To identify common neural motifs that might instantiate surround suppression across modalities, we review models of surround suppression and compare the evidence supporting the competing ideas that surround suppression has either cortical or subcortical origins in visual and barrel cortex. In the visual system there is general agreement lateral inhibitory mechanisms contribute to surround suppression, but little direct experimental evidence that intracortical inhibition plays a major role. Two intracellular recording studies of V1, one using naturalistic stimuli (Haider et al., 2010), the other sinusoidal gratings (Ozeki et al., 2009), sought to identify the causes of reduced activity in V1 with increasing stimulus size, a hallmark of surround suppression. The former attributed this effect to increased inhibition, the latter to largely balanced withdrawal of excitation and inhibition. In rodent primary somatosensory barrel cortex, multi-whisker responses are generally weaker than single whisker responses, suggesting multi-whisker stimulation engages similar surround suppressive mechanisms. The origins of suppression in S1 remain elusive: studies have implicated brainstem lateral/internuclear interactions and both thalamic and cortical inhibition. Although the anatomical organization and instantiation of surround suppression in the visual and somatosensory systems differ, we consider the idea that one common function of surround suppression, in both modalities, is to remove the statistical redundancies associated with natural stimuli by increasing the sparsenessor selectivity of sensory responses.;"[Sachdev, Robert N.
