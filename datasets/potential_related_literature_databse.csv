I. Unit activity related to spontaneous eye movements,"The region in and around the thalamic internal medullary lamina (IML) in the cat recently has been shown to contain neurons active with ocular saccades and responding to visual stimuli. In the present study, single-unit microelectrode recordings were made in the corresponding thalamic region of the alert monkey in order to determine whether neurons with similar properties existed. Our objective was to specify the functional characteristics of these thalamic cells in the monkey, since 1) cell populations in the central thalamus form an important link between brain stem structures, such as superior colliculus and paramedian pontine reticular formation, and cortical areas, such as frontal eye field and inferior parietal lobule; and 2) most neurophysiological information on these structures with regard to gaze mechanisms has been obtained in primates. In this first part of the study we report observations on 164 thalamic units whose activity was related to the performance of spontaneous eye movements, head fixed. The animals had been trained on a visual discrimination task but photic stimuli were used only for calibrating the eye-position recording and for inducing small saccades and smooth pursuit. The experiments were performed in dim red light and in total darkness. Three types of units were found: 67 saccadic burst units, 58 saccade pause-rebound units, and 39 eye-position units. Sixty-two of the burst units had a directional preference. Most of the on-directions were contraversive, and it was in such units that the lead time of firing before saccades was the longest (up to at least 400 ms). Some of the burst units had a movement field, others fired more intensively and with a longer lead time, depending on the eccentricity of the eye position reached in orbit. The five units with no directional preference were the ones showing the best relation of burst duration with saccade duration. Three types of pause-rebound units were distinguished, depending on whether the saccadic pause or the postsaccadic burst was the most conspicuous event or the pause occurred after saccade offset. The three types were called, respectively, omnipausers, omnirebound cells, and late pausers. Omnipausers and omnirebound cells had no directional preference but their typical firing patterns occurred very consistently with all saccades, even less than 2 degrees. In a few units, the rebound progressively faded away in total darkness. The relation of firing rate of eye-position units with eccentricity of the eyes in orbit was analyzed. Fluctuations in time and a hysteresis effect were found to affect this relation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

According to the data obtained from cytometric analysis, the histogram patterns of cell dimensions and cell density in each ventrolateral thalamic nucleus in humans and monkeys were very similar. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase-stained sections revealed a parcellation of the ventrolateral thalamic nuclei that could be correlated with that in the monkey thalamus. Apart from differences of size, the nuclei of the human and monkey thalamus are remarkably similar. We proposed accordingly that a new parcellation of human thalamic nuclei be based on cytometric analysis and histochemical staining.",Human thalamus; Monkey thalamus; Cytometory; Acetylcholinesterase; Thalamus;,

Connections to the lateral cervical nucleus and to the reticular nucleus of the cord in the C1 and C2 segments are present. In the medulla the most prominent connections are to the nuclei “Z” and “x” of Brodal and Pompeiano, to the rostral portion of n. gracilis and to the n. proprius of the restiform body. Minor projections reach the rostral part of the medial and lateral cuneate nuclei, the reticular nucleus, the n. centralis dorsalis and the periependymal gray. There were no projections to planes rostral to the medulla. In view of the connections established it is concluded that ascending systems in the DLF to the brain stem of primates are concerned with transmission of mechanoreceptor input to the cerebellum and thalamus and that nociceptive relay appears very unlikely.",,

Discrete islands of AChE reactivity were found that correlated precisely in location with the pattern of projections from the superior colliculus and pretectum. Specifically, AChE overlies terminal fields of superior colliculus projections in the DLG, in four foci in the medial and lateral pulvinar, and in several foci in the inferior pulvinar. All of these tectal projection areas have very high AChE reactivity such that they are easily distinguished. In addition, the pretectum projects to a specific focus in the lateral pulvinar that also has a very dense AChE histochemical reaction. A number of these AChE foci could be further distinguished from other areas in the pulvinar by myeloarchitectonic characteristics. Some of the foci in the lateral and inferior pulvinars could also be distinguished by unique cytoarchitectonic features (as seen with both Nissl and Golgi stains). In an attempt to determine the possible origin of a cholinergic input to the pulvinar, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injections and choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry were also done. The results of this experiment indicate that the AChE reactivity seen in the midbrain projection zones to the thalamus may be due to the precise overlap of terminal projections from the brainstem cholinergic cell groups, Ch5, Ch6, and Ch8. These results, taken together, imply that there are several anatomically and histochemically distinct zones related to extre ageniculate pathways located within classically defined thalamic boundaries.",,

A k-means cluster analysis, a nonhierarchical clustering technique, was performed using the relative magnitudes of responses to a graded series of innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli applied to the receptive field. For comparison, a parallel analysis was performed based on definitions of low-threshold (LT), wide dynamic range (WDR), and high-threshold (HT) cells used by our laboratory. For 128 STT cells, a classification scheme with three clusters was found statistically to be the best. This yielded groups of 22, 57, and 49 cells in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Cluster 1 cells were activated best by low-intensity mechanical stimuli, whereas cluster 3 cells were activated primarily by nociceptive stimuli. Cluster 2 cells had intermediate characteristics. When the classification scheme based on the cluster analysis was compared with the classification of the same neurons as LT, WDR, and HT cells, cluster 1 cells were divided into LT and WDR cells, whereas cluster 2 and 3 cells included WDR and HT cells. For 110 thalamic neurons, a classification scheme with five clusters was found statistically to be the best. Clusters 1-5 contained 25, 34, 17, 10, and 24 cells, respectively. Response characteristics of cells in each group indicated a gradual change in sensitivity to higher intensities of peripheral input from cluster 1 to 5. When this classification scheme was compared with the classification scheme previously used by our laboratory, cluster 1 cells belonged to the LT group, clusters 2 and 3 split into LT and WDR cells, and clusters 4 and 5 included WDR and HT cells. It is concluded that a classification scheme based on a cluster analysis of the responses of neurons to standardized stimuli may provide an objective and functionally meaningful way to categorize somatosensory neurons.",,

These nuclei, which might be considered components of an oculomotor thalamus (OcTh), are found within and at the borders of the internal medullary lamina. These nuclei have extensive anatomical links to numerous cortical and subcortical visuomotor areas including the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, caudate, and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Previous single-unit recordings have shown that neurons in OcTh respond during self-paced spontaneous saccades and to visual stimuli in the absence of any specific behavioral requirement, but a thorough account of the activity of these areas in association with voluntary, goal-directed movement is lacking. We recorded activity from single neurons in primate central thalamus during performance of a visually guided delayed saccade task. The sample consisted primarily of neurons from the centrolateral and paracentral intralaminar nuclei and paralaminar regions of the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei. Neurons responsive to sensory, delay, and motor phases of the task were observed in each region, with many neurons modulated during multiple task periods. Across the population, variation in the quality and timing of saccade-contingent activity suggested participation in functions ranging from generating a saccade (presaccadic) to registering its consequences (e.g., efference copy). Finally, many neurons were found to carry spatial information during the delay period, suggesting a role for central thalamus in higher-order aspects of visuomotor control.",,

High frequency stimulation (HFS) patterns used in DBS therapy are known to modulate neuronal spike rates and patterns in the stimulated nucleus; however, the spatial distribution of these modulated responses are not well understood. Computational models suggest that HFS modulates a volume of tissue spatially concentrated around the active electrode. Here, we tested this theory by investigating modulation of spike rates and patterns in non-human primate motor thalamus while stimulating the cerebellar-receiving area of motor thalamus, the primary DBS target for treating Essential Tremor. HFS inhibited spike activity in the majority of recorded cells, but increasing stimulation amplitude also shifted the response to a greater degree of spike pattern modulation. Modulated responses in both categories exhibited a sparse and long-range spatial distribution within motor thalamus, suggesting that stimulation preferentially affects afferent and efferent axonal processes traversing near the active electrode and that the resulting modulated volume strongly depends on the local connectome of these axonal processes. Such findings have important implications for current clinical efforts building predictive computational models of DBS therapy, developing directional DBS lead technology, and formulating closed-loop DBS strategies.",,

Li, F. A. Lenz, L. Rowland, and S. Mittman. Correlation of effects of general anesthetics on somatosensory neurons in the primate thalamus and cortical EEG power. J. Neurophysiol. 77: 1375–1392, 1997. The effects of two types of general anesthetic on the neurophysiological properties of the primate somatosensory thalamus were correlated with effects on frontal cortex electroencephalographic (EEG) power and spectral properties. Graded doses of the intravenous agent methohexital sodium (METH) were studied in 12 cells in three monkeys on a halothane baseline anesthetic. Low doses of METH (0.2–1.0 mg/kg) produced a reduction of EEG power but had no effects on spontaneous or evoked thalamic activity. EEG power showed maximal attenuation after 2.0 mg/kg METH, whereas decreases in thalamic activity were first noted over a similar moderate dose range (2.0–5.0 mg/kg). The physiological parameter most sensitive to METH was the spontaneous activity, which showed initial changes in rate and pattern at moderate doses followed by marked inhibition at higher doses. Finally, the high dose of METH (10.0 mg/kg) produced marked reduction in all neurophysiological parameters with recovery over the following 30–45 min. The effects of the volatile anesthetic halothane were studied on 15 cells in four monkeys anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The low dose of halothane (0.25%) produced a facilitation of responses to cutaneous stimuli as well as a decrease in the rate and burst patterns in the spontaneous activity. The power in the EEG was not affected at this concentration. The responses of the cells to the mechanical stimuli at moderate doses (0.5–1.0%) of halothane returned to the baseline magnitude, whereas spontaneous activity remained unaffected compared with initial effects. EEG power was reduced by 1% halothane. Finally, all neurophysiological parameters showed profound reduction at the highest halothane concentrations (2.0–3.0%) with recovery over the next 30–45 min. In conclusion, the two classes of anesthetics most commonly used for acute neurophysiological studies in the primate show well-defined thresholds at which changes in the response properties of thalamic neurons are produced. This threshold for the barbiturates and halothane can be predicted by monitoring of cortical EEG.",,

The effects of stimulation on normal waking primates have never been evaluated. While low frequency stimulation has no effect, HFS induces dyskinesias contralateral to the stimulated STN resembling human hemiballismus and those obtained in primates after neurotoxic lesion or pharmacological blockade of the STN. In the normal monkey, HFS appears reversibly to incapacitate the STN and allow the emergence of involuntary proximal displacements, due to disinhibition of the thalamo-cortical pathway. In the MPTP-treated monkey HFS buffers STN overactivity and alleviates akinesia and rigidity by reducing inputs to the internal segment of the globus pallidus.",,

II. Unit activity related to visual events, targeting, and fixation","In alert monkeys, single-unit responses to visual stimuli were recorded in the central thalamic region where eye movement-related activity has been observed (33). Usually, the stimuli were 1 degree annulus patterns of dim light presented at unpredictable locations on a tangent screen. The animals were trained on two tasks: one in which they delivered the stimulus themselves by pressing a panel that they had to release immediately when the stimulus shape changed to a square, and another one in which the stimulus was turned on by the experimenter and the monkeys were rewarded for fixating this target for a predetermined length of time. In both tasks, continuous stimulus fixation was required. Receptive fields were tested with and without a fixation point. Retinal coordinates of stimuli were obtained by subtracting eye-position coordinates from stimulus coordinates in space, the monkey's head being fixed. Unit responses in the cases where targeting occurred or did not occur were analyzed separately. Transient responses were observed in 63 units and sustained responses in 44 units. Among the 63 units responding transiently, 42 did so irrespective of targeting. Their receptive fields were very large, generally including the fovea, and predominantly contralateral when the fields were asymmetric. The responses of the other 21 units depended on the occurrence of targeting. They were called visually triggered eye movement-related responses (VTEM). VTEM units were further subdivided in 9 units active only with targeting and 12 units showing the classical phenomenon of ""response enhancement"" under this condition. VTEM units were contrasted to six units that were both passively visually responsive and bursting with saccades, either spontaneous or visually triggered. The latencies of passive visual and VTEM responses to stimulus onset were comprised between 77 and 135 ms in 80% of the units. VTEM units also fired prior to retargeting saccades. Presaccadic units active with spontaneous saccades also discharged with visually elicited saccades. The earliest sign of activation after stimulus onset eliciting a saccade appeared between 80 and 100 ms, that is, in the same range of latencies as passive visual and VTEM units. Sustained visual responses consisted of activation in 18 units and inactivation in 26 units. The occurrence of these patterns of firing was related to stimulus fixation. In the majority of cases, the changes in discharge frequency started before fixation was achieved by a targeting saccade. They terminated before fixation was broken by a saccade away from the stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Contrary to this view, the present study shows that some single neurons in medial thalamus of alert monkey discriminate changes in the intensity of noxious stimuli that are equal to or below the monkey's own discrimination threshold. Since these neurons are also modulated by anesthesia and attentional factors, we suggest that parts of medial thalamus may participate in both discriminative and affective dimensions of pain.",,

The origin and topographical organization of input to the arm area of the primate motor cortex from the ventrolateral thalamus were examined using the method of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). 2. A thin, continuous slab of labeled neurons was found in the ventrolateral thalamus followingmultiple injections of HRP into the arm area of the motor cortex. The slab of labeled neurons was flanked, medially and laterally, by groups of unlabeled neurons. 3. The origin of ventrolateral thalamic input was more extensive than previously thought. Labeled neurons were found from A10.0 to A6.0 and occurred in three ventolateral thalamic subdivisions: ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo), ventralis lateralis pars caudalis (VLc), and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo). For simplicity this region containing labeled neurons has been termed the ventrolateral thalamic (VL) arm area. 4. Injections of HRP into the somatic sensory cortex indicated that the thalamic regions which project to the somatic sensory cortex are separate from the VL arm area. 5. The distribution of labeled neurons following single injections of HRP into different regions of the motor cortex arm area indicated that the VL arm area is topographically organized, particularly its caudal part. Ventral regions of the VL arm area were labeled following HRP injections into motor cortex regions adjacent to the central sulcus where the representation of largely distal musculature is localized. Dorsal regions of the VL arm area were labeled following HRP injections into motor cortex regions more rostral to the central sulcus where the representation of more proximal musculature is localized. 6. A larger region of the VL arm area was labeled following HRP injections adjacent to the central sulcus than following the more rostral motor cortex injections. This suggests that, like the arm area of the motor cortex, more of the VL arm area is allotted to the representation of distal than proximal musculature. 7. Following very small cortical HRP injections, isolated labeled thalamic neurons were diffusely scattered throughout a 3-mm rostrocaudal extent of the VL arm area. In addition, a small focal cluster of labeled thalamic neurons was also seen. The labeled cluster was limited to 0.5 mm rostrocaudally and 300 mum in width. The focal distribution of labeled thalamic neurons suggests that aspects of a point to point organization may exist in the connection between VL and the motor cortex arm area.",,

Due to variations in LTS amplitude, the number of action potentials evoked by an LTS could vary between 1 and 8. These data confirm the presence of two modes of firing in the monkey for thalamic relay cells, tonic and burst, the latter related to the activation of LTSs. With these details of the cellular processes underlying burst firing, we could account for many of the firing patterns we recorded from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in behaving monkeys. In particular, we found clear evidence of burst firing during alert wakefulness, which had been thought to occur only during sleep or certain pathological states. This makes it likely that the burst firing seen in awake humans has the same cellular basis of LTSs, and this supports previous suggestions that burst firing represents an important relay mode for visual processing.",,

We test whether the organizational rules that vPFC connections follow in macaques are preserved in humans. These rules concern the trajectories of some of the white matter projections from vPFC and how the position of regions in the vPFC dictate the trajectories of their projections in the white matter. To address this question, we present a novel approach that combines direct tracer measurements of entire white matter trajectories in macaque monkeys with diffusion MRI tractography of both macaques and humans. The approach allows us to provide explicit validation of diffusion tractography and transfer tractography strategies across species to test the extent to which inferences from macaques can be applied to human neuroanatomy. Apart from one exception, we found a remarkable overlap between the two techniques in the macaque. Furthermore, the organizational principles followed by vPFC tracts in macaques are preserved in humans.",,

The thalamic projections from each of the deep cerebellar nuclei are topographically organized in two and possibly in three dimensions. First, the caudo-rostral cerebellar nuclear dimension is mapped onto the mediolateral dimension within the cell-sparse ventral lateral thalamic region (VPLo, VLc, VLps, and nucleus X). By correlating this topographic ordering with the previously established lamellar organization of the cell-sparse thalamic region39,64, a somatotopy is inferred within the deep cerebellar nuclei, with caudal body parts represented anteriorly and rostral body parts represented posteriorly in each nucleus. A second topography consists of the mapping of the mediolateral dimension of the dentate and interpositus nuclei onto the ventrodorsal dimension of the lamellae in the thalamus. Since the thalamic connections with motor cortex predict a somatotopic organization with distal body parts ventral and axial parts dorsal in thalamus, each cerebellar nucleus should, therefore, represent axial body parts laterally and distal parts medially. A third mapping dimension is shown for the dentatothalamic projection : dorsal parts of the dentate nucleus project posteriorly within the cell-sparse thalamic region, and ventral parts project anteriorly. The significance of this as regards representation of the body is not known. Subsidiary foci of terminations within the cellsparse thalamic region are visible following tritiated amino acid injections into each of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Following dentate injections these foci appear as anteroposteriorly elongated, rod-like aggregations of terminations which are similar to the rod-like aggregations of thalamocortical relay cells which have been demonstrated following focal injections of horseradish peroxidase into the motor cortex39. The interpositothalamic and the fastigiothalamic terminations are elongated and appear as focal clusters in all planes of section. The interpositothalamic clusters are distributed within posterodorsally curving planar sheets. An anterograde double labeling technique, using a combination of the autoradiographic technique with the axonal degeneration technique, was used to investigate the interrelations of the terminations from different nuclei and from different parts of the same nucleus.

Combination of these techniques constitutes a novel approach for the collection and analysis of neuroanatomical data. Together, these techniques enable large-scale, and therefore more comprehensive, sampling of selective neuronal populations and establish unbiased quantitative methods for describing morphologically unique neuronal classes within a population. The protocol outlines the use of modified rabies virus to selectively label neurons. G-deleted rabies virus acts like a retrograde tracer following stereotaxic injection into a target brain structure of interest and serves as a vehicle for the delivery and expression of EGFP in neurons. Large numbers of neurons are infected using this technique and express GFP throughout their dendrites, producing ""Golgi-like"" complete fills of individual neurons. Accordingly, the virus-mediated retrograde tracing method improves upon traditional dye-based retrograde tracing techniques by producing complete intracellular fills. Individual well-isolated neurons spanning all regions of the brain area under study are selected for reconstruction in order to obtain a representative sample of neurons. The protocol outlines procedures to reconstruct cell bodies and complete dendritic arborization patterns of labeled neurons spanning multiple tissue sections. Morphological data, including positions of each neuron within the brain structure, are extracted for further analysis. Standard programming functions were utilized to perform independent cluster analyses and cluster evaluations based on morphological metrics. To verify the utility of these analyses, statistical evaluation of a cluster analysis performed on 160 neurons reconstructed in the thalamic reticular nucleus of the thalamus (TRN) of the macaque monkey was made. Both the original cluster analysis and the statistical evaluations performed here indicate that TRN neurons are separated into three subpopulations, each with unique morphological characteristics.","Neuroscience, Issue 120, neuroanatomy, retrograde tracer, modified rabies virus, neuronal reconstruction, independent clustering algorithms, cluster evaluation",

The animals were trained to perform wrist movement paradigms including: (a) visually triggered skilled, voluntary movements; (b) 100-ms duration torque pulse perturbations applied during a hold period (termed Pa perturbations); (c) 100-ms perturbations that commenced 100 ms after the visual trigger but during preparation before a skilled, voluntary movement (termed Pb perturbations); and (d) 100-ms perturbations during the skilled, voluntary movement (termed Pm perturbations). These Pb and Pm perturbations were used to identify central and peripheral influences on patterns of neuronal discharge in the ventrolateral thalamus. There was no systematic difference between the responses to Pb and Pm perturbations of neurones in the cerebellar thalamus and those in VPLc. The responses of VPLc and cerebellar thalamic neurones to Pa perturbations were considered to represent transduction of peripheral afferent input, and these responses were compared with the responses to the other types of perturbations. Up to 40% of neurones in cerebellar thalamus and VPLc responded to Pb and Pm perturbations in a similar pattern to that which followed Pa perturbations, and therefore most likely represented faithful transduction of peripheral input. However, the response of over half the neurones in VPLc and cerebellar thalamus to Pb or Pm perturbations differed from Pa perturbations in a manner suggesting that central influences had gated the peripheral input. The short-latency response in cerebellar thalamus which was modified by central influences is appropriately timed to contribute to the “intended” response to perturbations of motor cortical neurones.",,

Referred pain of visceral origin has three major characteristics: visceral pain is referred to somatic areas that are innervated from the same spinal segments as the diseased organ; visceral pain is referred to proximal body regions and not to distal body areas; and visceral pain is felt as deep pain and not as cutaneous pain. The neurophysiological basis for these phenomena is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the organization of viscerosomatic response characteristics of spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in the rostral spinal cord. Interactions were determined among the following: 1) segmental location, 2) effects of input by cardiopulmonary sympathetic, greater splanchnic, lumbar sympathetic, and urinary bladder afferent fibers, 3) location of excitatory somatic field, e.g., hand, forearm, proximal arm, or chest, 4) magnitude of response to hair, skin, and deep mechanoreceptor afferent input, and 5) regional specificity of thalamic projection sites. 2. A total of 89 STT neurons in segments C3-T6 were characterized for responses to visceral and somatic stimuli. Neurons were activated antidromically from the contralateral ventroposterolateral oralis or caudalis nuclei of the thalamus. Cell responses to visceral and somatic stimuli were not different on the basis of the thalamic site of antidromic activation. Recording sites for 61 neurons were located histologically; 87% of lesion sites were located in laminae IV-VII or X. There was no relationship between response properties of the neurons and spinal laminar location. 3. Different responses to visceral stimuli were observed in three zones of the rostral spinal cord: C3-C6, C7-C8, and T1-T6. In C3-C6, urinary bladder distension (UBD) and electrical stimulation of greater splanchnic and lumbar sympathetic afferent fibers inhibited STT cells. Electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents increased cell activity in C5 and C6 and either excited or inhibited STT cells in C3 and C4. In the cervical enlargement (C7-C8), STT cells generally were either inhibited or showed little response to stimulation of visceral afferent fibers. In T1-T6, input from greater splanchnic and cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent nerves increased activity of STT cells. Lumbar sympathetic afferent input inhibited cells in T1-T2 and had little effect on cells in T3-T6, whereas UBD decreased cell activity in all segments studied. 4. In general, stimulation of somatic structures increased activity of STT neurons in segments that received primary afferent innervation from the excitatory somatic receptive field or in the segments immediately adjacent to these segments. Only input from the forelimb, especially the hand, markedly excited cells in C7 and C8.+",,

Although a recent study showed that corollary discharge signals through the thalamus to the cortex are used for internal monitoring of saccades, it remains unknown whether signals in the thalamus also contribute to monitoring and on-line regulation of smooth pursuit. The present study sought possible roles of the thalamocortical pathways in pursuit by recording activities of single thalamic neurons and by analyzing the effects of local inactivation. Data showed that many neurons in the ventrolateral thalamus exhibited directional modulation during pursuit. Most neurons discharged before or during initiation of pursuit, and the firing rate was proportional to the speed of target motion in a preferred direction. When the tracking target was extinguished briefly during maintenance of pursuit, these neurons continued firing, indicating that they carried extra-retinal, eye movement signals. The majority of neurons showed no change in activity around the time of small catch-up saccades during pursuit but responded transiently to large (16°) memory-guided saccades in the preferred pursuit direction. Local inactivation of the recording sites did not alter pursuit latency but reduced eye velocity modestly during initiation and maintenance of ipsiversive pursuit. The results suggest that the central thalamus lies within pathways that regulate and monitor smooth pursuit eye movements.","eye movement, smooth pursuit, central thalamus, primate, single unit, inactivation",

The ventral spinothalamic tract is shown to be independent entity with respect to the lateral spinothalamic tract; its fibers are widely distributed in the ventral funiculus and it establishes connections with the brain stem and thalamus which are analogous but not identical to those of the latter. Its role in the relay of nociceptive input is discussed in view of the similarity in hodology of the two systems and it is proposed that it may be responsible for the failure of anterolateral cordotomy to control pain on a long term basis. Other ascending systems in the ventral funiculus include the spino-olivery and spino-reticular tracts, as well as minor connections to the N. of Edinger-Westphal, the red nucleus and the superior colliculus. The projections from the ventral quadrant of the spinal cord to the brain stem are almost entirely ipsilateral until the rostral mesencephalon is reached, at which level the N. of Darkschewitz receives both ipsilateral and crossed input; the magnocellular nuclues of the medial geniculate body receives a small contribution which is mainly ipsilateral.

They differ in that inferior but not lateral pulvinar receives a projection from the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. In this study, the internal organization of these two subdivisions is compared by relating light microscopic Golgi morphology to the synaptic organization observed by electron microscopy. The Golgi impregnated neurons in inferior and lateral pulvinar are typical of other thalamic nuclei and are not qualitatively different in the two subdivisions. Projection neurons (PN) vary in cell body (15–40 μm) and dendritic tree (150–600 μm) diameters but bear the same varieties of dendritic appendages; spine-like, hair-like, and knot-like. Local circuit neurons (LCN) have smaller cell body diameters (10–20 μm) but can have very large dendritic field diameters (150–600 μm). They are best distinguished from PNs by their elaborate dendritic appendages, which have been identified as pre-synaptic dendrites in the EM. LCN axons are infrequently seen. In the EM both subdivisions contain four types of synaptic terminals. RS and RL terminals both contain round synaptic vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts, but are subdivided on the basis of small (RS = 0.09 μm) versus large (RL = 2.2 μm) cross sectional diameters and organelle content. RLs contact larger caliber dendrites and frequently form synaptic complexes with presynaptic dendrites of LCNs, while RSs contact fine caliber dendrites and rarely take part in synaptic complexes. F terminals and P boutons both contain flat and pleomorphic vesicles and make symmetric synaptic contacts. They are characterized by vesicle number and cytoplasmic density. Fs are infrequently observed in pulvinar compared to P boutons and are of uncertain origin. P boutons can be equated with LCN dendritic appendages and have been identified as pre-synaptic dendrites. The quantitative distribution of each type is very similar in both subdivisions, averaging RS 85%, RL5%, F 0.3%, P 8% and unidentified 2%.",,

The consequent degeneration in the efferent pathways from these cortical regions to the caudate nucleus, the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and adjacent structures was studied at 5- and 15-day survival times by a modification of the Nauta-Gygax method for tracing degenerating fibers. Following dorsolateral lesions, considerable numbers of black-impregnated degenerating fibers were found in the parvocellular division of the dorsomedial nucleus and in the fiber bundles of the internal capsule and the subcallosal fasciculus at all ages. In contrast, the degree of Nauta-Gygax degeneration in the anterodorsal sector of the head of the caudate nucleus was age-dependent: degenerating fibers were found in increasing numbers from two months of age, when virtually none could be detected, to 24 months of age, when they appeared in relatively dense concentration. Similar results were obtained following orbital prefrontal lesions at the same three ages: degeneration in the magnocellular division of the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and in the internal capsule were not related to age, but anterograde degeneration in the ventral and lateral capsular region of the caudate increased substantially with advancing age. Negative results with the Nauta-Gygax technique in very young animals may not signify an actual absence of the connection in question, but our findings, together with those of other studies employing silver degeneration methods, at least suggest that in the primate, certain cortical efferents undergo maturational changes during postnatal life, a fact which may be related to the differential behavioral consequences of cortical injuries at different stages of development.",,

We have compared thalamic single neuron activity in nine patients with organic dystonia to that in a patient with psychogenic dystonia (Psyd) and in healthy waking monkeys. In organic dystonia, EMG power is commonly concentrated at the lowest frequency of the smoothed autopower spectrum (0.39Hz). Therefore, segments of spike trains with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 2 at 0.39 Hz were termed dystonia frequency (DF) segments, which occurred more commonly during dystonia related to movement. Those with a SNR < 2 were termed non-dystonia frequency (nDF) segments, which are associated with spontaneous dystonia. We concentrated on nDF activity since neuronal activity in our controls was measured at rest. Neuronal spike trains were categorized into those with post-inhibitory bursts (G, grouped), with single spikes (NG, non-grouped), or with both single spikes and bursts (I, intermediate). nDF spike trains in ventral oral had more G category firing in dystonia than in controls. The burst rate and the pre-burst silent period in nDF firing of organic dystonia were consistently greater than those of both the monkeys and the patient with Psyd. The distribution of the pre-burst silent period was bimodal with a longer mode of approximately GABAb (gamma amino butyric acid receptor - type b) duration. These results demonstrate distinct differences of post-inhibitory bursting in organic dystonia versus controls. The presence of inhibitory events consistent with GABAb duration suggests interventions for treatment of dystonia.","dystonia, thalamus, single neuron analysis, low threshold spike bursts, thalamotomy",

The data suggest that only 1.3–1.9% of the excitatory, or asymmetric synapses in layer IVCα of striate cortex are provided by the neurons of the magnocellular layers of the LGN. This amounts to only 18–40 of the 1000–2100 asymmetric synapses that the average layer IVCα neuron receives. The parvicellular afferents to layer IVCβ, on the other hand, provide 3.7–8.1% of the asymmetric synapses formed by the average layer IVCβ neuron, or 37–191 synapses to each neuron. If it is assumed that the boutons in the geniculocortical axonal plexuses are evenly spread, it can be calculated that the input to an individual layer IVC neuron is provided by some 24 axonal plexuses. This is regardless of whether the neuron lies in layer IVCα or in IVCβ. This calculation suggests that a single axonal plexus provides not more than one or two of the excitatory synapses received by an individual layer IVCα neuron, and between one and eight excitatory synapses for a layer IVCβ neuron. Consequently, it is unlikely that the response properties of a particular cortical neuron are dominated by its input from a single geniculate neuron. Since the geniculocortlcal input essentially determines the response properties of neurons in layer IV of macaque striate cortex, it is surprising that this input amounts to such a small number of synapses to an individual neuron, although we obtained a somewhat similar result in our earlier quantitative analysis of the geniculate input to the striate cortex of the cat (Peters and Payne, 1993). But it has to be questioned whether the low values obtained are correct. Interestingly, the geniculocortical input to cortex has been largely neglected in favor of analyses of intracortical circuitry, but in view of the basic importance of this afferent input, it is suggested that more quantitative data about it should be generated, so that a better assessment can be made of its extent.",,

A. Benevento (1977) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 3:573; Rezak, M. (1978) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 4: 642), of macaque monkeys. PL gamma receives convergent inputs from the occipital cortex and has strong reciprocal interconnections with the visual association cortex, including the inferotemporal cortex (areas 20 and 21). It was found the that PL gamma has a poor or nonexistent retinotopic organization. Many of the neurons had large, unflanked, overlapping receptive fields which often included the fovea. A few neurons could be influenced by a visual stimulus placed anywhere in the visual field described by a tangent screen. The receptive fields could be bilateral or located entirely within the contralateral or ipsilateral hemifields. The majority of units were binocular and exhibited various types of binocular interaction which could be quite complex. The binocular response was not predictable from the algebraic sum of the monocular responses and could be of the opposite sign (e.g., excitatory when the monocular response was inhibitory). Neurons which were also sensitive to the direction of movement of stimuli projected upon the tangent screen formed a major group. Of the units sensitive to tangentially moving stimuli, two special subgroups were found. One group of neurons gave sustained responses to static levels of luminance, while the other group was sensitive to simuli which moved toward or away from the eyes. The nonlinear rate of change of the apparent size of approaching or receding stimuli was described by a mathematical function which also describes the response of the neurons to the same stimuli. For many of these units which were sensitive to tangentially moving stimuli and one other class of stimuli, such as luminance levels of movement in depth, the responses to one class were seemingly unrelated to the responses to the other class. The same statement may be made for monocular and binocular responses. It may be, then, that different wiring diagrams describe these different types of inputs. These physiological results are discussed in terms of the inputs to PL gamma as well as its cortical targets.",,

In vision, a canonical thalamic circuit comprises the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and V1. LGN relay cells project to the striate cortex, and en route to the cortex they emit collaterals within the TRN. The cortex sends a feedback projection to the LGN, which also provides collaterals to the TRN. Although these thalamocortical feedforward and corticothalamic feedback connections to the TRN are excitatory, the projection from the TRN to the LGN provides the major extrinsic inhibitory input to the LGN. Many proposed mechanisms of the emergence of early attention within the thalamocortical circuit involve rhythmic burst firing in LGN cells. The encoding of a stimulus becomes distorted during burst firing, but the background noise significantly decreases, which leads to better signal detectability (Guido et al., 1995). Consequently, bursts have been hypothesized to function as a “wake-up” call signaling environmental changes to the cortex (Sherman, 2001), possibly providing better target detection or initial discrimination of an unattended object. Because the activation of low-threshold bursts requires removal of inactivation by membrane hyperpolarization, the TRN seems ideal for providing the inhibition necessary to modulate the responses of LGN cells during attentional processing (Crick, 1984). However, little is known about the way TRN activity changes with attention. A recent article by McAlonan et al. (2006) in The Journal of Neuroscience addressed this issue by examining the activity of TRN neurons during a cross-modal attention task. The authors recorded from single neurons in two macaque monkeys trained to shift attention between two stimuli. The monkeys were required to direct attention to the appropriate sensory stimulus, an auditory tone or a visual spot, cued by the color of a central fixation point. A green fixation point signaled a visual trial, whereas a red fixation point indicated an auditory trial. After both stimuli were presented simultaneously for 500–1000 ms, either the auditory or visual stimulus was decreased in intensity independently of the other. The monkey was required to maintain its gaze until two blue spots appeared below and above the central fixation point and then make a saccade to one of the targets only if the intensity of the attended stimulus changed. Therefore, a green fixation point instructed the monkey to attend to a visual stimulus and saccade to the upper target if the spot dimmed during the trial. Conversely, a red fixation point indicated an auditory trial and that a saccade should be made to the bottom target if the volume of the tone decreased. Although the authors did not observe burst firing with or without attention in TRN cells, they reported high background activity and a transient response of increased neuronal discharge to the stimulus onset [McAlonan et al. (2006), their Fig. 2 (http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/16/4444/F2)]. The transient response occurred when attention was directed to either stimulus [McAlonan et al. (2006), their Fig. 4A (http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/16/4444/F4)]. However, the amplitude of the response was greater when attention was shifted to the visual spot compared with the auditory tone [McAlonan et al. (2006), their Figs. 4B (http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/16/4444/F4) and 5A (http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/16/4444/F5)] with no change in response latency or duration. On average, the peak response was 10% greater for the attended visual stimulus, and the majority of TRN cells exhibited higher neuronal responses during visual trials compared with auditory trials [McAlonan et al. (2006), their Fig. 5C (http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/26/16/4444/F5)]. Visual attention task using spatial cues. A green fixation point indicates that attention should be directed to the circle on the right, whereas the red fixation point instructs the monkey to attend to the left circle. During the trials, either spot could dim or remain constant independently of the other. If the appropriate stimulus decreases in intensity, the monkey should saccade to the corresponding target when the blue dots appear. [Figure adapted from McAlonan et al. (2006).] To ensure that the monkeys were selectively attending to the appropriate stimuli, two indices were used to determine their level of performance. The results suggest that attention was directed to only one stimulus during each trial. A bias for the visual stimulus was expected because of the highly visual nature of monkeys. Therefore, it seems important to examine effects of attention within a single modality, and additional investigations focusing on the modulation of a visual stimulus are warranted. Figure 1 illustrates such a visual attention task using intramodal spatial cues in which the auditory sensory stimulus has been eliminated, thereby removing any biases between competing sensory modalities and enabling investigators to provide a clear interpretation of the effects of attentional modulation.  Moreover, the core of Crick’s (1984) hypothesis is based on the spatial specificity of synaptic inputs and suggests that TRN activity results in spatially organized positive feedback. Because of the topographic arrangement of inputs within the thalamocortical circuit, an active patch of cortex may stimulate similar spatial regions of the TRN and LGN, resulting in vertical assemblies. According to Crick (1984), the TRN may effectively intensify activity by producing rapid firing of bursts within a subset of thalamic neurons and suppressing the remaining neurons. This may play out as a “push–pull” system, in which cortical feedback from layer VI plays a defining role in setting up the spatial organization of attentional modulation (Tsumoto et al., 1978) and directs the searchlight to the attended target. In summary, McAlonan et al. (2006) performed the first study examining the neuronal mechanisms of attentional modulation in TRN neurons of nonhuman primates. The TRN neurons showed increased activity in response to a visual stimulus with attention. Ultimately, the increased activity could play a role in attentional processing by facilitating visual detection and discrimination through the initiation of burst firing in LGN cells. Such increases in TRN activity may also underlie selective firing reductions in regions of the LGN outside of the attentional spotlight, or in other sensory modalities by interactions occurring through intrathalamic projections (Crabtree, 1999).",,

Changing the gain between the wrist movement and visual display required the monkey to adapt its wrist movement. This adaptation consisted of progressive reduction of movement amplitude over a number of trials (phase 2) until a stereotyped movement accommodating the new gain was learned (phase 3). The experiment's aim was to investigate whether cerebellar thalamic neuronal discharge (ND) changed during motor adaptation and whether this change was related to scaling of kinematic parameters or movement error. Extracellular single-cell recordings were made from ""wrist-related"" neurones in the cerebellar thalamus (59) and the nucleus ventro-posterior lateralis caudalis (VPLc) (37) of each monkey while they performed the movement paradigm. Neurones were selected for further analysis (37/59 cerebellar thalamic and 23/37 VPLc) if phase-1 movements were stereotyped and motor adaptation occurred in phase 2 (according to statistical definitions). When the gain initially changed, there were positional errors in the form of overshoot. Adaptation to the new gain was achieved by a variety of strategies, including modification of the amplitude of kinematic parameters and positional error in addition to reduction of time to peak velocity and movement time. During stereotyped movements, most cerebellar thalamic neurones fired before movement onset and before VPLc neurones. During adaptation, this order of onset of firing was reversed, and cerebellar thalamic neurones discharged after VPLc neurones and close to the onset of movement. During motor adaptation, the mean rate of phasic ND rose in a large proportion of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones, and the proportion of cerebellar thalamic neurones that encoded a signal about positional error and movement amplitude also increased. In addition, there is set-related activity in the discharge of a majority of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones. This does not appear to be specifically related to motor adaptation, but is related to the movement amplitude. We have discussed the role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway in error detection in the light of the similarities between discharge patterns of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones. We speculate that, when learned movements are performed, the discharge of cerebellar thalamic neurones occurs before movement, perhaps representing an efference copy of the intended movement. During adaptation, this signal is gated out, and later-arriving peripheral afferent input dominates cerebellar thalamic discharge.",,

The only consistent changes shown by all lesioned monkeys on the 30-min, single-bottle intake test were a significantly attenuated consumption of 0.003 M quinine hydrochloride and a significantly elevated intake of 0.1 M sodium chloride. These specific taste deficits are contrary to the global hypogeusia predicted on the basis of previous research. A revised definition of the boundaries of the gustatory thalamus is suggested and the merits of the thalamic monkey preparation are compared with those of the decerebrate rat model.",,

We recorded from single cells in and about the border of the dorsal portion of the lateral pulvinar and the adjacent medial pulvinar of awake behaving Macaca mulatta in order to determine how the properties of these two functionally dichotomous cortical systems were represented. We found a class of pulvinar neurons that responded differentially to ten different patterns or broadband wavelengths (colors). Thirty-four percent of cells tested responded to the presentation of at least one of the pattern or color stimuli. These cells often discharged to several of the patterns or colors, but responded best to only one or two of them, and 86% were found to have statistically significant pattern and/or color preferences. Pattern/color preferential cells had an average latency of 79.1 ± 46.0 ms (range 31–186 ms), responding well before most inferotemporal cortical cell responses. Visually guided and memory-guided saccade tasks showed that 58% of pattern/color preferential cells also had saccade-related properties e.g. directional presaccadic and postsaccadic discharges, and inhibition of activity during the saccade. In the pulvinar, the mean presaccadic response latency was earlier, and the mean postsaccadic response latency was later, than those reported for parietal cortex. We also discovered that the strength of response to patterns or colors changed depending upon the behavioral setting. In comparison to trials in which the monkey fixated dead ahead during passive presentations of pattern and color stimuli, 92% of the cells showed attenuated responses to the same passive presentation of patterns and colors during fixation when these trials were interleaved with trials which also required active saccades to pattern and color targets in the periphery. We conclude that properties which represent the functionally dichotomous object and spatial visual systems are found together in single pulvinar neurons and that the responses of these cells to pattern or color stimuli are influenced by the focus of spatial attention. The pulvinar is the first structure in the brain shown to have neurons which integrate both object and spatial properties and the response latencies indicate that this information is processed before that in cortex. These results are discussed in terms of role of the pulvinar in visual attention as well as its unique role in providing both object feature and spatial location information to the inferotemporal cortex.",Monkey pulvinar; Inferotemporal cortex; Parietal cortex; Form and color; Saccades;,

Subsequent studies reported saccade-related activity in the primate PrGC. To determine its contribution, we characterized pregeniculate units (n = 128) in alert macaques during ocular motor tasks and visual stimulation. We found that 36/109 saccade-related units exhibited postsaccadic bursts or pauses in tonic discharge for saccades of any amplitude or direction. In contrast to previous results, 46/109 responses preceded or coincided with the saccade, while 47/109 responses were directionally tuned. Pregeniculate units were modulated not only in association with saccades (109/128) but also with smooth eye movements and visual motion (20/128) or eye position (23/128). Multiple ocular motor signals were recorded from 19% of the units, indicating signal convergence on individual neurons. Visual responses were demonstrated in 51% of PrGC units: visual field illumination modulated the resting discharge of 33 units; the responses of 37 saccade-related units and all 23 position-dependent units were modulated by visual stimulation. Early saccadic activity in the PrGC suggests that it contributes more to gaze than postsaccadic modulation of visual or ocular motor activity. The patterns of saccadic responses and the modulation of PrGC activity in association with a variety of visual-ocular motor behaviors suggest its potential role as a relay between the parietal cortex and elements of the brain stem ocular motor pathways, such as the superior colliculus and pretectal nucleus of the optic tract.",,

Stimulating left or right vagal afferents inhibited 20 (50%) and excited 4 (10%) of 40 STT neurons. Vagal stimulation reduced activity of the 20 inhibited cells by 71 +/- 6% and reduced the average activity of all 40 STT neurons by 28% from 11.5 +/- 1.3 to 8.3 +/- 1.4 impulses/s (P less than 0.01). Effects of activating thoracic and abdominal or just abdominal vagal afferents were also determined. Stimulating right abdominal vagal afferents inhibited 4 (11%), excited 1 (3%), and did not affect 30 (86%) of the STT neurons and overall did not significantly affect STT cell activity. In contrast, in 33 of these cells stimulation of afferents in the right cervical vagus inhibited 16 (48%), excited 2 (6%), and did not affect 15 (45%) neurons and overall significantly reduced cell activity by 29% (P less than 0.01).

To determine how the NOT can influence structures that move the eyes, we injected it with lectin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and characterized its afferent and efferent connections. The NOT sent its heaviest projection to the caudal half of the ipsilateral dorsal cap of Kooy in the inferior olive. The rostral dorsal cap was free of labeling. The NOT sent lighter, but consistent, projections to other visual and oculomotor-related areas including, from rostral to caudal, the ipsilateral pregeniculate nucleus, the contralateeral NOT, the lateral and medial terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system bilaterally, the ipsilateral dorsolateral pontine nucleus, the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, and the ipsilateral medial vestibular nucleus. The NOT received input from the contralateral NOT, the lateral terminal nuclei bilaterally, and the ipsilateral pregeniculate nucleus. Although our injections involved the pretectal olivary nucleus (PON), there was neither orthograde nor retrograde labeling in the contralateral PON. Our results indicate that the NOT can influence brainstem preoculomotor pathways both directly through the medial vestibular nucleus and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and indirectly through both climbing and mossy fiber pathways to the cerebellar flocculus. In addition, the NOT communicates strongly with other retino-recipient zones, whose neurons are driven by either horizontal (contralateral NOT) or vertical (medial and lateral terminal nuclei) fullfield image motion. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

It has been controversial as to whether this opponency can derive from random connectivity; if receptive field centers of cells near the fovea are cone-specific due to midget morphology, this would confer some degree of color opponency even with random cone input to the surround. A simple test of this mixed surround hypothesis is to compare spatial frequency tuning curves for luminance gratings and gratings isolating cone input to the receptive field center. If tuning curves for luminance gratings were bandpass, then with the mixed surround hypothesis tuning curves for gratings isolating the receptive field center cone class should also be bandpass, but to a lesser extent than for luminance. Tuning curves for luminance, chromatic, and cone-isolating gratings were measured in macaque retinal ganglion cells and LGN cells. We defined and measured a bandpass index to compare luminance and center cone-isolating tuning curves. Midget retinal ganglion cells and parvocellular LGN cells had bandpass indices between 0.1 and 1 with luminance gratings, but the index was usually near 1 (meaning low-pass tuning) when the receptive field center cone class alone was modulated. This is strong evidence for a considerable degree of cone-specific input to the surround. A fraction of midget and parvocellular cells showed evidence of incomplete specificity. Fitting the data with receptive field models revealed considerable intercell variability, with indications in some cells of a more complex receptive structure than a simple difference of Gaussians model.",,

The fluorescent retrograde tracers Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow and the anterograde tracer Rhodamine Dextran were injected into closely related cutaneously responsive sites in primary somatosensory cortex, e. g., adjacent digits. Supra- and infragranular layers in nearly all studied areas contained labeled pyramidal cells. Labeled infragranular cells predominated at the fringes of a distribution where cells labeled from different tracer injections in the same brain intermixed more. All topographical regions across area 1 have reciprocal connections with areas 4, 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and 5. Intrinsic connections within area 1 and between it and area 2 are greatest; those with area 3b are less. Intrinsic connections within area 3b exceed all other nearby projections from this area which reciprocally connects with areas 3a, 1 and 2. Connections appear topographically organized, including those with poorly mapped regions, like area 5. These connections link representations of neighboring skin and skip map regions that include disjoint dermatomal areas. Connections from adjacent digit representations overlap; however, double-labeled cells were not found. Distal and proximal digit zones mostly interconnect within an area. Intrinsic connections spread further in area 1 than in area 3b, thereby joining more disparate topographical zones than interareal connections, which project more homotopically. The domain over which the map in somatosensory cortical area I (SI) dynamically changes following in tracortical microstimulation (Recanzone, Merzenich and Dinse, Cerebral Cortex 2:181-196, 1992) may depend on the range of intrinsic connections observed in this study. The extent of connections between cortical areas was less than expected and this challenges the hypothesis that these connections directly create receptive field enlargements.",,

We recorded from single neurons in awake, trained rhesus monkeys in a lighted environment and compared responses to stimulus movement during periods of fixation with those to motion caused by saccadic or pursuit eye movements. Neurons in the inferior pulvinar (PI), lateral pulvinar (PL), and superior colliculus were tested. 2. Cells in PI and PL respond to stimulus movement over a wide range of speeds. Some of these cells do not respond to comparable stimulus motion, or discharge only weakly, when it is generated by saccadic or pursuit eye movements. Other neurons respond equivalently to both types of motion. Cells in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus have similar properties to those in PI and PL. 3. When tested in the dark to reduce visual stimulation from the background, cells in PI and PL still do not respond to motion generated by eye movements. Some of these cells have a suppression of activity after saccadic eye movements made in total darkness. These data suggest that an extraretinal signal suppresses responses to visual stimuli during eye movements. 4. The suppression of responses to stimuli during eye movements is not an absolute effect. Images brighter than 2.0 log units above background illumination evoke responses from cells in PI and PL. The suppression appears stronger in the superior colliculus than in PI and PL. 5. These experiments demonstrate that many cells in PI and PL have a suppression of their responses to stimuli that cross their receptive fields during eye movements. These cells are probably suppressed by an extraretinal signal. Comparable effects are present in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. These properties in PI and PL may reflect the function of the ascending tectopulvinar system.",,

The neuronal discharge was displayed as a raster centred on movement of the wrist. The discharge patterns of both neurones was very strongly correlated with movement. Three experienced researchers were asked to examine the data and to classify every part of each trial as background discharge, `on' (increased firing rate) or `off' (decreased or zero firing rate) and to mark the times that neuronal discharge changed state. A `standard output' was made from these classifications. A back-propagation artificial Neural Network (the Network) was used to model the standard output and cumulative sums (CUSUMs) and maximum likelihood was then performed on the data and compared with the Network. There was a high correlation between the output of each observer (r>0.61) and the standard output and between the Network and the standard output (r>0.99). However the correlation between standard output and CUSUMs (r=0.06) and standard output and maximum likelihood (r=0.36) was much lower. The Network could be trained with as few as 12 trials, indicating a high degree of constancy in the methods employed by the observers. The Network was also highly efficient at detecting changes in state of neuronal activity (r>0.99). In summary, when used on single trial data, visual inspection is a reliable method for detecting timing of change neuronal discharge and is superior to CUSUM and maximum likelihood. As well it is capable of detecting neuronal discharge state: that is whether firing rate is increased, normal or decreased. Neural Networks promise to be a useful method of confirming the consistency of visual inspection as a means of detecting changes in neuronal discharge pattern.",Neural Network; Neuronal discharge; Cumulative sum; CUSUM; Maximum likelihood; Visual inspection;,

From previous studies we know that although removal of SI or SII in the adult macaque produces severe and irreversible impairment on a variety of tactile tasks, normal function can be obtained after partial or total SI lesions in the infant. From the present studies we have found that, as with SI, neither unilateral nor bilateral removals of SII in infants significantly affected the acquisition of or the performance on size tasks, but did cause a temporary delay in acquisition of texture tasks. Performance on texture threshold tasks was normal. The removal of the remaining SI in a juvenile animal that had received a unilateral SI lesion in infancy did not disrupt the recovered function, indicating that recovery is not mediated by the intact SI. However, when SI and SII were removed together from the same hemisphere in an infant, either sequentially or simultaneously, major impairment in the acquisition of texture tasks followed. These results suggest that although SI and SII are necessary for normal tactile function in the adult macaque, they show an equipotentiality for mediating normal tactile function after damage to either area in infants.",,

In the primate, acute inactivation of the superior colliculus delays the onset of a visually guided saccade, slows its velocity, and shortens its amplitude. Previous research leaves uncertain whether other oculomotor disorders which sometimes follow ablation of this structure are due to tectal pathology, to neural damage surrounding the tectum, or to both causes. In this study, 7 cynomolgous monkeys received SC ablations. In 3 others, control lesions were placed in the pretectal/posterior thalamic region. Both procedures produced a qualitatively similar syndrome of 4 oculomotor changes. Reaction time to initiate saccades to visual targets was slowed. Secondly, the surgery constricted the normal ocular range. At the worst, movement was confined to a radius of 10–12°; of primary gaze. The monkeys displayed two kinds of inaccuracies when attempting to foveate stationary visual targets within their surviving ocular range. Saccadic amplitude was reduced, causing the monkeys' initial attempt to fall short of foveating the target. If the target remained lighted there then ensued a series of stepwise corrective saccades toward it. The corrective saccades ceased with the eyes still at a position short of the target. Eye position remained in error for the duration of the trial. The final position was independent of the target's retinal position or the vector of the motor command needed to acquire the target. Rather, the error was related to the angular position of the target about the head (= desired eye position). The syndrome appeared qualitatively similar whether resulting from tectal or the more rostral pretectal/diencephalic ablation. When occurring along the horizontal axis, the deficits appeared to require damage to the superior colliculus, perhaps combined with pathology of some other structure. The same syndrome along the vertical axis was better correlated with pretectal/diencephalic pathology. Invasion of these areas together with invasion of the transthalamic axons from the frontal eye fields is interpreted as the critical pathology responsible for the syndrome. A similar oculomotor trajectory can be modelled by supposing a loss in the gain of the signal which conveys the target's retinal position, combined with one other fault in the circuit: either a loss in gain of the eye position signal, or the signal representing the target's position in craniocentric coordinates.",Superior colliculus; Oculomotor range; Reaction time; Monkey;,

In addition, we have examined the responses to the syllables' isolated formants and formant pairs. Response features are related to the cortical tonotopic organization, as determined by examining the responses to selected pure tones. MUA patterns that differentially reflect the spectral characteristics of the steady-state formant frequencies and formant transition onset frequencies underlying consonant place of articulation occur at sites with similarly differentiated tone responses. Whereas the detailed spectral characteristics of the speech sounds are reflected in low frequency cortical regions, both low and high frequency areas generate responses that reflect their temporal characteristics of fundamental frequency and VOT. Formant interactions modulate the responses to the whole syllables. These interactions may sharpen response differences that reflect consonant place of articulation. Response features noted in A1 also occur in TC fibers. Thus, differences in the encoding of speech sounds between the thalamic and cortical levels may include further opportunities for formant interactions within auditory cortex. One effect could be to heighten response contrast between complex stimuli with subtle acoustical differences.",Auditory cortex; Thalamocortical radiation; Multiple unit activity; Syllable; Formant; Tonotopic organization;,

In them, a burst period is defined as an interval in which there are a significantly higher number of spikes as compared to other intervals in the spike train. Oscillation is defined as a spike train in which significant periodicity is detected in its autocorrelogram. The main feature of our burst detection method is that discharge density (i.e., the number of spikes in a short interval) is used instead of the interspike interval. This enables one to assess the likelihood of having burst periods in a spike train. We use the Lomb periodogram to detect periodicity in an autocorrelogram. This method gives one significance of periodicity detected and enables the detection of multiple frequencies in an autocorrelogram. The advantage of these methods is discussed in comparison with the other methods used to detect bursting and oscillatory activity.",Algorithm; Autocorrelation; Burst; Neuronal activity; Oscillation;,

Both clinical and experimental neurophysiological studies have shown that unilateral brain ischemia can produce an alteration in the CBF or EEG recorded from the contralateral hemisphere—that is, the phenomenon of diaschisis. The chapter explains that CBF diaschisis is not common in monkeys and that EEG diaschisis occurs less frequently than CBF diaschisis. Attempts have been made to check these suggestions in the experimental animals measuring SSEPs bilaterally along with local CBFs. The different components of the cortical SSEP provides useful information on the localization of the infarcted cortical area.",,

During slow wave sleep, synchronizations between pulvinar and cortical neurons occurred. They could be related to the occurrence of the slow wave pattern during which concomitant phasic decrease in unit activity took place in both structures. Such relationships were found between the parietal gyrus and the dorsolateral pulvinar and between the occipital gyrus and the ventrolateral pulvinar, in good agreement with known anatomical data. No similar synchronizations could be detected when 66 thalamic sites in other nuclei were analyzed. The results were compared to available data and the possible role of the pulvinar in slow wave sleep was discussed.",,

Two monkeys received juice reward for sitting quietly while an investigator probed the monkey's face with mechanical stimuli. Extracellular single unit recordings were made from the ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus (VPM), and mechanical response properties were evaluated for each cell having an extraoral cutaneous receptive field. Of 89 cells examined, 90% responded best to innocuous tactile stimulation, and were classified as low threshold. The other 10%, classified as wide dynamic range, showed a graded response to increasingly intense stimuli, with a maximum discharge to noxious pinch. Of the low threshold neurons, most exhibited excitatory responses, with about half being rapidly adapting and the others slowly adapting. The spontaneous activity of 11% of the low threshold neurons was inhibited by stimulation of the neuron's receptive field. There was no systematic difference in receptive field size for the various types of neurons, but the receptive fields of wide dynamic range cells were smaller than those previously observed in trigeminothalamic neurons of the medullary dorsal horn. The wide dynamic range and inhibitory low threshold neurons were located primarily in the caudal third of VPM, while the excitatory low threshold neurons were located throughout. In summary, response characteristics of VPM neurons show more diversity in the alert monkey than has been reported in paralyzed and/or anesthetized animals.",,

Seventy-one ST neurons were studied in 39 anesthetized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each neuron could be excited by manipulation of its somatic field and by electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers. LTV stimulation resulted in inhibition of the background activity of 43 (61%) ST neurons. Nine (13%) were excited, 3 (4%) were excited and then inhibited, while 16 (22%) did not respond. There was little difference among these groups in terms of the type of somatic or sympathetic afferent input although inhibited cells tended to be more prevalent in the more superficial laminae. The degree of inhibition resulting from LTV stimulation was related, in a linear fashion, to the magnitude of cell activity before stimulation. LTV inhibition of background activity was similar among wide dynamic range, high threshold, and high-threshold cells with inhibitory hair input. Any apparent differences in LTV inhibitory effects among these groups were accounted for by the differences in ongoing cell activity as predicted by linear regression analysis. LTV stimulation inhibited responses of 32 of 32 ST cells to somatic stimuli. In most cases the stimulus was a noxious pinch; however, LTV stimulation also inhibited responses to innocuous stimuli such as hair movement. Bilateral cervical vagotomy abolished the inhibitory effect of LTV stimulation on background activity (six cells) or responses to somatic stimuli (seven cells). Stimulation of the cardiac branch of the vagus inhibited activity of three cells to a similar degree as LTV stimulation, while stimulation of the vagus below the heart was ineffective in reducing activity of 10 cells. We conclude that LTV stimulation alters activity of ST neurons in the upper thoracic spinal cord. Vagal inhibition of ST cell activity was due to stimulation of cardiopulmonary vagal afferent fibers coursing to the brain stem, which appear to activate descending inhibitory spinal pathways. Vagal afferent activity may participate in processing of somatosensory information as well as information related to cardiac pain.",,

Such premovement slow cortical potentials were interpreted to be composed mainly of currents due to excitatory postsynaptic potentials in superficial parts of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons through certain thalamocortical projections. To test the interpretation, the same electrodes were utilized to record cerebellothalamocortical responses and corticocortical responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the cerebellar nucleus and of the cerebral cortex. These results were compared with the laminar field potentials of cerebellothalamocortical and corticocortical responses recorded with glass microelectrodes in acute experiments with monkeys.

The type 2 synapses, known to be GABAergic (Ribak, 1978) and therefore presumed to be inhibitory, developed faster on the alpha neurons than the beta neurons. Both neuron groups show a marked increase and then decline in the percentage of the somatic membrane covered by type 2 synaptic appositions during this 36-week time period. The time course of the type 2 synapses development is compared to that of the spine synapse development described in previous studies (Lund and Holbach, 1991; Lund et al., 1991), and it is clear that on both neuron groups this inhibitory synapse population is put in place and refined later than the spine synapses. These findings suggest that each cortical neural circuit has a unique time course for its early development within an overall time window (Rakic et al., 1986), or sensitive period (Hubel and Wiesel, 1970). Visual deprivation, although causing the alpha and beta neurons to adopt a more similar temporal and numerical developmental pattern than normal, did not prevent acquisition and loss phases of type 2 synapses or the assumption of a normal numerical loading by 36 weeks of age.",,

This chapter summarizes the major anatomical relations of the amygdala to discuss how these connections may support behavior. It examines ways in which the amygdalar complex may contribute to behavior. The amygdalar complex is anatomically related both to cortical processing areas devoted to all the traditional sensory modalities, such as vision, touch, and audition, as well as to cortical and subcortical processing systems known to be related to the quasi-modality of emotion. Thus the amygdale is in a position to process information about both affective and nonaffective sensory events. Results from a few recent behavioral studies, conducted as part of a larger program investigating the neural basis for learning and memory, have been presented in the chapter to illustrate major points.",,

Immunoreactivity for all 4 peptides is found in extrinsic afferent fibers innervating the dorsal thalamus, ventral thalamus and epithalamus. The distributions of such fibers are more extensive than previously described and include many relay nuclei in their zones of terminations. SP fibers are particularly concentrated in the ventral posteromedial nucleus. All peptides are especially concentrated in fibers in the intralaminar and reticular nuclei. Afferent fibers immunoreactive for each of the 4 peptides approach the thalamus by two pathways. An anterior route is formed by the classical periventricular system ascending from the hypothalamus to the epithalamus. A posterior pathway ascends in the lateral midbrain tegmentum and provides innervation to posterior, intralaminar, and many relay nuclei, plus the ventral thalamus.

In a necessary preliminary step it was shown that virtually all of the degeneration disappeared from the thalamus within twelve months after PCS interruption so that degeneration resulting from the subsequent electrolytic mesencephalic lesions could be attributed to interruption of non-cerebellascending fibres. The results show that degeneration was present in the thalamus following the electrolytic mesencephalic-diencephalic lesions but it could be accounted for on the basis of damage either to residual PCS fibres, to somatosensory pathways, to intrathalamic connections or to cell groups or projection fibres of the reticular formation, substantia nigra of globus pallidus. It is concluded that there is no direct rubrothalamic projection in the monkey and, in particular, no evidence of a projection from the red nucleus to the ventral lateral of ventral anterior thalamic nuclei. The results also indicate that the mesencephalic reticular formation is the main source of ascending afferents to the nucleus reticularis thalami. Some observations were made concerning nigrostriatal and nigrothalamic projections. Retrograde cell changes resulting from unilateral lesions made caudal to the red nucleus were studied in three animals.

Using clicks, responses from thalamocortical axons and cortical cells were differentiated on the basis of their response latency, spatial distribution, and relationships to AEP components. Voice onset time was reflected in MUA time-locked to consonant release and voicing onset, and phase-locked to the syllables' fundamental frequency. Place of articulation was reflected in discriminative ‘on’ and phase-locked responses occuring to the formant transitions of the syllables. Duration of the voiced formant transitions was represented by an accentuation of the phase-locked responses occurring to this period. Activity of thalamocortical fibers and cortical cells differed. Thalamocortical fibers were more responsive to speech sounds, as well as responding more frequently with a phase-locked response pattern. Cortical cells responded with sustained activity to a greater degree. Responses to identical portions of the vowels were biased by the preceding consonant.

Saccades (fast, direct eye movements) made to electrical targets were comparable to saccades made to optical targets. Gaze locations for electrical targets were well predicted by measured visual response maps of cells at the electrode tips. With two electrodes, two distinct targets could be independently created. A sequential saccade task verified that electrical targets were processed not in motor coordinates, but in visual spatial coordinates. Microstimulation produced predictable visual percepts, showing that this technique may be useful for a visual prosthesis.","primate, prosthesis, tetrode",

Neurons that combine information about sensory stimuli and their behavioral relevance are thought to contribute to the decision mechanisms that link specific stimuli to specific responses. We reported in a previous study that neurons in central thalamus carry spatial information throughout the instructed delay period of a visually guided delayed saccade task. The goal of the current study was to determine whether the delay-period activity of thalamic neurons is modulated by behavioral context. Single neurons were evaluated during performance of visually guided and memory-guided variants of a saccadic choice task in which a cue designated the response field stimulus as the target of a rewarded saccade or as an irrelevant distracter. The relative influence of the physical stimulus and context on delay-period activity suggested a minimum of 3 neural groups. Some neurons signaled the locations of visible stimuli regardless of behavioral relevance. Other neurons preferentially signaled the locations of current saccadic goals and did so even in the absence of the physical stimulus. A third group signaled only the locations of currently visible saccadic goals. For the latter 2 groups, activity was the product of both stimulus and context, suggesting that central thalamic neurons play a role in the context-dependent linkage of sensory signals and saccadic commands. More generally, these data suggest that the anatomical substrate of sensorimotor decision making may include the cortico-subcortical loops for which central thalamus serves as the penultimate synapse.",,

The present study used extracellular injections of PHA-L to delineate extrinsic axon arbors and to assess the possibility of categories that might correlate with these specific neuronal subpopulations. Two distinct types of terminations were found. Type I have smaller caliber preterminal axons, are generally elongate, and are studded with spinelike terminal specializations. Type II have larger axons (gt 1.0 mUm), spherical arbors, and mainly beaded specializations, some of which are conspicuously large ( 3.0 mUm).

I. Parallel enhancement of responses of spinothalamic tract neurons to mechanical stimulation and excitatory amino acids,"Somatosensory neurons of the spinal cord, including projection neurons, become hyperexcitable to mechanical stimuli during the development of experimental arthritis in rats and cats and hence are suggested to participate in the generation of arthritic hyperalgesia in humans. The experiments described here show a potentiation of the responses of spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in monkeys during the development of an acute arthritis. The results demonstrate that the responses of STT neurons to mechanical stimuli and to iontophoretically applied excitatory amino acids (EAAs), particularly those acting at
(non-NMDA) receptors, become enhanced during the development of inflammation produced by intra-articular injection of kaolin and carrageenan. Since the enhancement of both responses follows a similar time course, the results of this work suggest a role for EAAs in the hyperalgesia associated with arthritis and hence may provide a possible pharmacologic target for alleviation and/or prevention of arthritic pain.",Primate; Hyperalgesia; Microiontophoresis; Glutamate; Aspartate; Dorsal horn; Spinal cord;,

Moderately dense pericellular and terminal degeneration was found in all layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, in all layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, some cells undergoing retrograde degeneration exhibited a Fink-Heimer positive argyrophilia that was interpreted as being different from the argyrophilia associated with anterograde degeneration.

The temporal pole region contains four architectonically defined cortical divisions. Medially, the allocortex of the temporal limb of the pyriform cortex is annexed to the temporal lobe neocortices at the limen insulae. Two transitional neocortices, the periallocortical and proisocortical divisions, are situated subjacent to the pyriform area. They make up the largest part of the temporal tip and separate the pyriform cortex from the architecturally more progressive isocortical divisions of the pole found laterally at the rostral ends of the superior and inferior temporal gyri. Neuroanatomical tracers were injected into each of the major divisions of the temporal pole cortex, and the injection site locations were characterized cytoarchitectonically as well as geographically. Injections of tritiated amino acids into pyriform allocortex or into the transitional neocortical fields revealed an efferent projection to the magnocellular medial dorsal nucleus. The terminal field was characterized by a mosaic type of organization and contained discrete zones of axonal termination in which bursts of coarse label surrounded neuronal perikarya and their proximal dendrites. A similar projection was also observed when horseradish peroxidase was injected into the transitional cortices. However, perikarya participating in the terminal clusters were not retrogradely labeled. Intracortical injections restricted to lateral polar isocortex did not result in either anterograde or retrograde transport of label to MDmc. These findings demonstrate a nonreciprocal, corticofugal pathway to MDmc that originates in the phylogenetically older districts of the temporal pole. The conduction of limbic sensory information directly from temporal neocortex to the medial thalamus may play a fundamental role in human and primate memory.",,

As previously reported, a unilateral cerebellar hemispherectomy including the lateral and interpositus nuclei eliminates the cerebellar-mediated superficial thalamo-cortical (T-C) responses recorded in the forelimb motor cortex contralateral to the hemispherectomy. These T-C responses normally precede the hand movement, and the operation results in the delay of movement initiation. The electrodes in the forelimb area of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex showed an enhancement of superficial T-C responses of the somatosensory cortex for 30–40 days after the operation. The enhanced potentials preceded the delayed movement as do the cerebellar-mediated superficial T-C responses of the motor cortex in normal situations. Local cooling of the somatosensory cortex following the cerebellar hemispherectomy disturbed the reaction time movement for a few weeks after the operation. This effect was rarely encountered in normal monkeys. The present study suggests the compensatory motor function of the somatosensory cortex for the dysfunction of the motor cortex in early weeks after cerebellar hemispherectomy.",,

These responses are shown to be significantly modified by pairing the visual stimulus with pre-conditioning stimulation of targets in the LP Pulvinar complex. Pre-conditioning stimuli were either single pulses, or a 50 ms train of pulses at 100 Hz delivered through bipolar electrodes 20 ms prior to, simultaneously with, or 50 ms following the visual stimulus. In some cases, modifications of the visual responses appeared as more massive discharges; in others they became bursts of constant latencies, pattern and duration, that contained high frequency discharges. A preconditioning single stimulus delivered simultaneously to a few sites in the LP, medial and lateral pulvinar was more effective than stimulation at a single electrode site, and produced an enhancement that appeared like an additive effect of several inputs. In the enhanced condition, repetition of single pulse preconditioning stimulation resulted in a considerable build-up of the enhancement. A pre-conditioning train of stimuli delivered during enhancement resulted in a further increase in the constancy of response durations and patterns. These changes, lasting as long as five minutes, manifested hysteresis: when recovery was allowed without any pre-conditioning stimulation, the various response patterns appeared in a reverse order. It is proposed that this dependence of the responses on the neural state is based on a complex network of inputs to cells of area 7.",,

Numerous immunoreactive fibers were also detected in the regions that contain the pathways to extrathalamic areas such as the stratum zonale and inferior thalamic peduncle. In the hypothalamus, many immunoreactive neuronal perikarya were distributed in the lateral hypothalamic area and in the arcuate nucleus. Immunoreactive fibers were disseminated throughout the hypothalamus, but they were dense in the preoptic area and sparse in the ventromedial nucleus. An accumulation of dense immunoreactive endings was also observed in the external layer of the median eminence.

The primate ventrobasal complex has a similar synaptic organization to sensory thalamic nuclei in other species. Two synaptic profiles within the ventrobasal complex contain flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and are GABA-immunoreactive. F-boutons (=F1 type, Guillery's classification; Guillery: Z. Zellforsch. 96: 1–38, '69) are located principally in the extraglomerular neuropil and contain densely packed flattened synaptic vesicles and several elongate mitochondria and establish symmetric (Gray's type II) synaptic contacts. These boutons are not found postsynaptic to any other element and are presynaptic principally to nonimmunoreactive elements that are thought to be thalamocortical relay cell dendrites. PSD-boutons (=F2 type, Guillery's classification) contain a moderate number of flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and fewer mitochondria than F-boutons. PSD-boutons are found in glomerular and extraglomerular areas of neuropil and establish symmetric synaptic contacts. These boutons are considered to be appendages of interneuron dendrites and are postsynaptic to RL-, RS (Guillery's classification)-, F-, and other PSD-boutons. PSD-boutons are presynaptic to thalamocortical relay neurons and interneuron dendrites including PSD-boutons. Problems in distinguishing F- from PSD-boutons are addressed by comparing immunostained and nonimmunostained material and by the use of serial sections. The majority of synaptic contacts between pleomorphic vesicle-containing profiles appear to be between PSD-boutons and other components of interneurons. Few contacts between F-boutons and local circuit neurons are seen. These data suggest the principal GABAergic input to interneurons in the primate ventrobasal complex is derived from other interneurons.",,

The response properties of neurons of the spinocervicothalamic pathway were studied in anesthetized macaque monkeys. Graded innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli, including sinusoidal vibration and thermal pulses, were applied to the cutaneous receptive fields. 2. Forty-nine cells in the lateral cervical nucleus (LCN) were identified by antidromic activation from the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the contralateral thalamus. Twelve spinocervical tract (SCT) cells in the lumbosacral enlargement of the spinal cord were identified by antidromic activation from stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus below C3 but not above C1. 3. Latencies for antidromic activation of LCN neurons averaged 2.3 ms, corresponding to a mean conduction velocity of approximately 17 m/s. Mean latency for orthodromic activation of LCN neurons following electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves was 12.6 ms. Overall mean conduction velocity for the monkey spinocervicothalamic pathway was estimated to be 29 m/s. 4. Most LCN cells had receptive fields on hairy skin, but some had input from glabrous skin and a few had subcutaneous fields. The receptive fields of most SCT cells had a glabrous skin component. Receptive fields tended to be smaller for SCT than LCN cells even for fields on a comparable part of the distal hindlimb. 5. Based on their responses to a series of mechanical stimuli (brushing, pressure, pinch, and squeeze), LCN and SCT cells were classified as low-threshold (LT), wide dynamic range (WDR), or high-threshold (HT) neurons. Most of the cells were in the LT or WDR classes. Thus the spinocervicothalamic pathway in the monkey differs from the spinothalamic tract (STT), in that STT cells are generally of the WDR or HT classes. 6. With the use of discriminant analysis, LCN and SCT neurons were allocated to categories determined from a k-means cluster analysis of the responses of 318 STT cells. The LCN and SCT neurons were in different proportions in the various categories than were STT cells, suggesting differences in the signaling properties of the spinocervicothalamic and spinothalamic paths. 7. Innocuous steady indentation of the skin failed to excite any of the neurons tested. Thus no positive evidence was obtained for an input to LCN neurons from slowly adapting mechanoreceptors. 8. Sinusoidal vibratory stimuli were used to test the ability of LCN and SCT neurons to follow repeated innocuous mechanical stimuli. Vibration at 10 Hz and an amplitude of 100 micron resulted in repetitive discharges in most LCN neurons and half the SCT neurons tested; many LCN neurons had thresholds below 25 micron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

At least three types of axonal terminals can be distinguished: large, dense (type I) terminals containing rounded vesicles; medium-sized, pale (type II) terminals containing pleomorphic and flattened vesicles, and small, dense (type III) terminals containing rounded vesicles.Type I terminals form asymmetrical axo-dendritic synapses with large secondary dendrites and asymmetrical axo-axonal synapses with type II terminals, at which the latter invariably constitute the postsynaptic element. Type I terminals also form multiple, usually asymmetrical, filamentous contacts with secondary dendrites. Type II terminals form usually symmetrical axo-dendritic synaptic junctions with secondary dendrites, except in the synaptic complexes where these junctions are usually asymmetrical. Type III terminals form (asymmetrical) synaptic junctions only with dendrites; the junctions are most commonly and characteristically effected with fine, distal dendrites, and much less commonly with secondary dendrites. Synaptic contacts with somata and primary dendrites have not been found, nor ''presynaptic dendrites''. Occasional dendro-dendritic filamentous junctions have been observed. The dominant synaptological feature of the neuropil is the occurrence of localised aggregations of secondary dendrites and synaptic knobs of types I and II which have been termed synaptic complexes; the latter resemble closely the synaptic glomeruli of certain other thalamic nuclei. The synaptic complexes of the inferior pulvinar, however, are but poorly encapsulated by glial lamellae. The most meaningful subdivision of the synaptic zone of the neuropil is into proximal (i.e. secondary dendritic) and distal dendritic types, each of distinctive and fairly homogeneous synaptic organization.Two to nine days after occipital lobotomy, almost all type I terminals were found to exhibit degenerative change of the neurofilamentous hyperplastic type; no subsequent electron-dense transformation of the affected visual corticofugal profiles has been observed. Terminals of types II and III remained completely normal. A number of electron-dense profiles interpreted as somata and dendrites showing acute retrograde necrosis or indirect Wallerian degeneration, were also observed.",Visual system; Cortical projections; Inferior pulvinar; Synaptology; Ultrastructure; Macaca mulatta;,

When the stimulation was timed to occur during or after an eye movement, the evoked saccade had a modified trajectory, compensating for, at least, the last portion of the ongoing eye movement. The hypothesis proposed to explain this compensatory effect (Schlag-Rey et al. 1989) is that the electrical stimulation produces a saccade by generating a signal, equivalent to a retinal error, specifying the saccade goal at a fixed location with respect to some eye position (called reference eye position). If the eyes are moving at the time of stimulation, the reference eye position lies somewhere along the trajectory of the ongoing movement. In the present study, we tried to determine this reference eye position, and deduce from it the instant at which the goal was specified. A significant timing difference was observed between thalamic and collicular stimulations. The goal appeared to be referred to an eye position existing at stimulation onset in superior colliculus (SC), and 35–65 ms before stimulation onset in central thalamus. In the latter case, the results suggest that the evoked saccade was aimed at the spatial location that the brain computed by summing a retinal error signal (evoked by stimulation) with the eye position at the time such a signal would have been elicited by a real target. In contrast, the collicular results suggest that the evoked saccade was directed to the retinal location specified by the retinal error signal. The findings imply that if the eyes are not steady while the target position is calculated, signals conveyed in the superficial layers of SC (in contrast to the thalamus) cannot direct the eyes correctly to a visual target.",,

In the present study, activity of the RS cortex was investigated using radioactive 2-DG while the monkey was performing a visual tracking task with a delay (a delayed-response task) for 45 minutes. A remarkable increase in 2-DG uptake was observed equally in the left as well as in the right RS cortex. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus also showed increased 2-DG uptake. In addition, other memory-related structures (prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus) showed a similar increase in 2-DG uptake compared to control monkeys, though their respective absolute values were different from one another. Since the RS cortex receives afferents from the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, which is one of the main nuclei of the Papez circuit, it is assumed that the RS cortex is important in memory function. Therefore, the remarkable increase in 2-DG uptake in the present study could reflect some aspects of memory or learning processes required to perform the delayed response.",2-Deoxy-d-glucose Retrosplenial cortex Monkey Delayed response;,

It is believed that the operation is effective because it cuts the spinothalamic tract (STT), a primary pathway carrying nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the brain in humans. In recent years, there has been controversy regarding the location of STT axons within the spinal cord. The aim of this study was to determine the locations of STT axons within the spinal cord white matter of C2 segment in monkeys using methods of antidromic activation. Twenty lumbar STT cells were isolated. Eleven were classified as wide dynamic range neurons, six as high-threshold cells, and three as low-threshold cells. Eleven STT neurons were recorded in the deep dorsal horn and nine in superficial dorsal horn. The axons of the examined neurons were located at antidromic low-threshold points (<30 μA) within the contralateral lateral funiculus of C2. All low-threshold points were located ventral to the denticulate ligament, within the lateral half of the ventral lateral funiculus (VLF). None were found in the dorsal half of the lateral funiculus. The present findings support our previous suggestion that STT axons migrate ventrally as they ascend the length of the spinal cord. Also, the present findings indicate that surgical cordotomies that interrupt the VLF in C2 likely disrupt the entire lumbar STT.",,

Five of the animals were tested following left unilateral ablation, whereas the other five were tested following right unilateral ablation. After postoperative testing, symmetrical lesions were made in the remaining hemisphere in two animals from each group and the effect of bilateral lesions was assessed. The animals were tested using a shock avoidance procedure. Unilateral ablation of left auditory cortex consistently resulted in an initial impairment in the ability to discriminate between the vocalizations with the animals regaining normal performance in 5-15 sessions. In contrast, right unilateral ablation had no detectable effect on the discrimination. Bilateral auditory cortex ablation rendered the animals permanently unable to discriminate between the coos. Although the monkeys could learn to discriminate the coos from noise and from 2- and 4-kHz tones, they had great difficulty in discriminating between the coos and tones in the same frequency range as the coos (i.e., 500 Hz and 1 kHz). The initial impairment following left unilateral lesions indicates that the ability to perceive species-specific vocalizations is lateralized to the left hemisphere. The observation that bilateral lesions abolish the discrimination indicates that the recovery in the left lesion cases was the result of the right hemisphere mediating the discrimination.",,

The exposed surface of the striate cortex was found to be connected to the rostral part of the SC and the caudal part of the LG. Injections of the exposed striate cortex close to its rostral border resulted in label in adjoining parts of the Pl and Pi.

Although prepotentials are found less frequently in the macaque than in the cat LGN, their electrical characteristics are similar, suggesting that they represent the arrival of impulses in a retinal afferent, as in the cat. The visual response properties of prepotentials and associated cells were similar under a variety of conditions, indicating that, apart from some response attenuation, little signal processing takes place in macaque LGN. A constant fraction of prepotentials above a threshold frequency gave rise to neuronal action potentials independent of the stimuli used, so that the frequency of cell action potentials was linearly related to the frequency of prepotentials. Since the maintained discharge rates of a cell and its prepotential always fell on the linear relation, the net responses of a cell and its prepotential to visual stimuli were approximately proportional to one another.",,

This improvement was attributed to the interruption of a long-loop recurrent excitatory mechanism, involving muscular afferents which are known to relay in the thalamic region where lesions were produced. The specific nature of this effect was suggested by the preliminary results of lesions performed in thalamic regions with non-specific cortical projections. Compared with the pre-lesional situation in which focal activity resulted in permanent motor troubles, the post-lesional state did not show any additional motor deficit. It is concluded that such lesions could be a new approach to controlling intractable motor epilepsies in man.",Monkey; Alumina focus; Focal motor epilepsy; Long-loop reflexes; Thalamotomy;,

I. Patterns of focal field potentials evoked by stimulations of dorsomedial thalamus in conscious monkey,"Focal field potentials and unit discharges of impulses evoked by low frequency (2–10/sec) stimulations of dorsomedial thalamus (DM) were simultaneously recorded with microelectrodes in the middle and inferior frontal gyri of the dorsal frontal granular cortex (FC) in the normal unanesthetized monkey. The depth profiles and sequences of responses of the FC evoked by the stimulations of DM were observed to be generally similar to the augmenting type of responses reported previously by others in the sensorimotor cortex of encéphale isoléor paralyzed cat. Stimulations of DM evoked short latency (3.2–4.0 msec) negative waves at a depth of 0.6–1.7 mm and correlated positive waves on the surface of the FC. Additional waves of alternating polarity succeeded the primary waves during augmenting sequences according to variations of stimulus strength and frequency. Unit discharges recorded with the same electrode simultaneously with field potentials revealed that a brief burst of 2–4 impulses occurred in association with each of the short latency deep negative waves evoked by repetitive stimuli. The latency of the earliest of the spikes of a burst was in the range of 6.5–9 msec. Following the burst of spikes, there was a long period of absence of spikes in each response. Surface corticograms of FC and nearby precentral cortex revealed that the evoked responses were highly pronounced and restricted to the frontal granular cortex and did not spread diffusely to the agranular cortex. Only a prolonged (40–60 sec) stimulation caused a synchronizing tendency in the corticogram of the agranular area. Furthermore, the evoked potentials in the corticogram of FC were presently only during quiet wakeful states, and became highly disorganized and almost indecipherable during states of synchronizing EEG and decreased consciousness as in natural slow-wave sleep or under Nembutal anesthesia. From these results, it is concluded that the dorsomedial thalamus is organized more like a specific thalamic nucleus to the frontal association cortex, and less like an integral part of the diffuse projection system.",,

Tonic increase in spontaneous discharge of 10 neurons in the lateral geniculate body preceded the loss of muscular tone by 35.8 + 21.8 seconds.

Previous studies show vagal inhibition of STT neurons in more caudal segments of the cord, which receive visceral spinal inputs and somatic inputs from proximal body regions. We hypothesized that activation of vagal afferents would inhibit cervical STT neurons that were excited by cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents and not inhibit those cells inhibited or unaffected by this visceral input. Because visceral pain is referred to proximal somatic fields, we also hypothesized that STT neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to distal areas would not be inhibited by vagal stimulation. In 42 cervical STT neurons, we found no difference in effects of vagal stimulation between cells excited or not excited by stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents. Responses to vagal stimulation also were the same for cervical STT cells with proximal or distal somatic fields. Furthermore, there was no difference in the inhibitory effects of vagal stimulation in cervical as compared to thoracic STT neurons.

When response is plotted as a function of the logarithm of stimulus intensity, the slope and shape of curves depends on wavelength. For wavelengths near the crossover point between excitatory and suppressive responses, nonmonotonic curves are common. Consequently, the form of spectral-response functions depends on stimulus intensity. Responses to combined stimuli made up of wavelengths close together near one spectral extreme are approximately additive. If one wavelength is near the crossover point, responses are nonadditive so that a midspectral wavelength, only producing a weak excitatory response, is able to occlude more vigorous responses to wavelengths near the spectral ends. Responses of parvocellular layer cells are consistent with their being a result of linear interaction of opponent cone mechanisms, the response of each of which follows a modified hyperbolic tangent function (22). Responses to all wavelength combinations, even those showing strikingly nonadditive effects, could be predicted from the additive opponent model described above.",,

The course of degenerating fibers in the thalamus was determined by utilizing the Nauta and Fink-Heimer I techniques. The principal projection sites of suprasylvian cortex were found to be the nuclei ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis posterior lateralis, ventralis posterior inferior, pulvinaris oralis, and pulvinaris medialis. Lesser amounts of terminal degeneration occurred in the nuclei reticularis, ventralis lateralis, lateralis posterior, the intralaminar nuclei, and the posterior and pretectal areas of the thalamus. The connections of the suprasylvian cortex that corresponds to somatosensory area II with a phylogenetically new thalamic nucleus, the pulvinaris oralis, suggests a specialization of SII functions in the monkey.",,

Electrical stimulation of the inferior parietal and the occipital cortex (here termed the “posterior eye fields”) normally evokes saccadic eye movements. We replicated previous reports that these evoked eye movements ceased after large tectal ablations. This initial finding suggested that the “posterior eye fields” depended on a single route of access to the saccade generator, one descending through the superior colliculus (SC). On closer examination, the critical lesion appeared to be one which removed the SC and cut efferents from the frontal eye field (FEE) coursing nearby. Subsequently we confirmed that eye movements evoked from the posterior eye fields ceased after cooling the SC, or cutting its efferents- but only when one of these procedures was combined with FEF ablation. Thus, visual signals from the occipital and inferior parietal cortex have more than one, but perhaps only two routes of access to the oculomotor system. One passes through the superior colliculus, the other through the frontal eye field. Ancillary experiments revealed that inferior parietal and FEF ablations, alone or combined, do not disrupt saccades evoked from the occipital lobe. Striate and prestriate areas can therefore use their own direct input to the SC or to the basal ganglia to drive saccadic eye movements.",,

The time of origin was determined by analysis of labeled cells in the pulvinar of monkeys that had been exposed to 3H-TdR at various embryonic (E) days and sacrificed 2–3 months after birth, which in this species occurs around E165. Heavily labeled pulvinar neurons were observed only in animals that had been exposed to 3H-TdR between E36 and E45. Onset of genesis for neurons that comprise the inferior and adjacent areas of lateral pulvinar precedes the onset in the remainder of lateral and medial pulvinar by two days. The site of origin and migratory pathways of pulvinar neurons were determined in a series of animals that had been exposed to 3H-TdR between E36 and E45 and sacrificed 1 h or 1, 3, 7, 14, and 42 days after injection. No neurons are produced within the pulvinar. Rather, they arise exclusively from the diencephalic ventricular and subventricular zones that border the third ventricle between sulcus medius and sulcus dorsalis. Postmitotic cells migrate laterally and in less than 3 days attain their position at the lateral aspect of the developing thalamus where they remain uniformly distributed during the first half of gestation. The cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the pulvinar are distinguished from adjacent thalamic nuclei by E60 whereas its own subdivisions emerge around E80. Morphometric analysis shows that the increase in the size of the pulvinar of the monkey during the last two thirds of gestation is due to cell growth, elaboration of cell processes, and arrival of various afferent inputs rather than to the influx of newly generated neurons, as in the human brain (Rakic and Sidman 1969). Instead the present data indicate that the pulvinar in monkey is generated much earlier than expected from previous studies and that unlike the human pulvinar, does not contain a subpopulation of neurons of telencephalic origin.",,

When the same stimulation was applied during or immediately after a spontaneous eye movement, the saccade trajectory was considerably modified: the eyes were driven, from wherever they were deviated by the spontaneous movement, to the point where the fixed-vector saccade would have brought them if the spontaneous movement had not occurred. This finding implies first, that saccades evoked from these sites are directed toward a goal and, second, that the goal is defined with respect to an eye position sampled long in advance (before the spontaneous eye movement). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the electrical stimulation evoked the retinotopic representation of a target whose spatial coordinates were then computed at further stages to produce a saccade. Using the present paradigm, it may be possible to distinguish brain sites processing retinal error (at the visual stage) from those processing motor error (at the motor stage).",,

Cone thresholds of cells varied from 1 to 10 td. Rod inputs were found in all classes of cells, including inhibitory inputs in some cells. Rod inputs were not apparent above 10–40 td, giving a total mesopic range of about 1–40 td. Strong rod-mediated responses could be evoked in broadband phasic cells and in spectrally opponent cells excited by short wavelengths. Only weak if any excitatory responses could be evoked by short wavelengths at scotopic levels in spectrally opponent long-wavelength excited cells. Hence, rod inputs do not confound the spectral responsiveness of cells because no spectrally opponent cell excited by long-wavelength stimuli at photopic levels became significantly responsive to short wavelength stimuli at mesopic or scotopic intensities. The so-called “rod color” may be blue.

The brains were perfused, sectioned transversely and stained with thionine. Resulting retrograde cell degeneration in the diencephalon and various other structures was examined microscopically and a comparison made between the newborn and adult animals. In the infant monkeys the following thalamic nuclei showed heavy cell loss: anterior dorsalis; anterior ventralis; anterior medialis (lateral two-thirds); ventralis lateralis; ventralis posterior lateralis; ventralis posterior inferior; lateralis dorsalis; lateralis posterior; reticularis; medialis dorsalis, partes parvocellularis and multiformis; pulvinaris; geniculatus lateralis dorsalis; geniculatus medialis, pars parvocellularis; and suprageniculatus. Nuclei showing partial cell loss were: anterior medialis (medial one-third); medialis dorsalis, pars densocellularis; reuniens; centralis latocellularis; alaris; centralis lateralis; paracentralis; limitans; and ventralis posterior medialis. Unaffected or only slightly affected nuclei included: ventralis anterior; medialis dorsalis, pars magnocellularis; geniculatus medialis, pars magnocellularis; centrum medianum; parafascicularis; centralis superior lateralis; and assorted midline nuclei. Thalamic degeneration in the adults was similar to the infants with the following exceptions which showed more severe cell loss in the adults: ventralis anterior; medialis dorsalis, pars magnocellularis; geniculatus medialis, pars magnocellularis; centralis lateralis; and paracentralis. Additional degeneration was present in three extrathalamic structures: the medial mamillary nucleus, which showed severe cell loss in the infants and partial cell loss in the adults; the caudal half of the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, which had virtually disappeared; and the ipsilateral pontine nuclei which were partially affected in the infants.

Spinothalamic neurons are found mainly in lamina I and in the lateral portions of laminae IV-VI throughout the side of the cord contralateral to the thalamic injection. Spinomedullary neurons are most ipsilateral to the medullary injection, in medial portions of laminae IV-VI throughout cervical levels but laterally, in the same laminae, in lumbar segments. At these levels, spinothalamic and spinomedullary neurons are also found along the lateral border of the ventral horn; neurons in this location, labelled by either injection, are large (40–65 μm in diameter), and are indistinguishable from ‘spinal border cells’ at the origin of the ventral spinocerebellar tract. Computer-assisted measurement of perikaryal size reveals that the mean values for dorsal horn neurons of the two systems differ significantly, although a sizeable fraction of both neuronal populations have identical cytological characteristics, including perikaryal size. A double-labelling strategy employing horseradish peroxidase and [3H]-apo-horseradish peroxidase has been applied
(a)
to identify simultaneously cells of origin of the two ascending systems and to appreciate better their topographical relationships, and
(b)
to answer the question of whether at least some of these spinal neurons have axons which, by way of collateral branching, reach both targets.
The distribution of neurons at the origin of the two ascending tracts in animals with injection of the two tracers is identical to that revealed in animals in which only horseradish peroxidase has been injected. While primarily single-labelled neurons are found throughout the cord, some large dorsal horn neurons in both brachial and lumbosacral enlargements are labelled by both cytoplasmic horseradish peroxidasepositive granules and by reduced silver grains on the overlying emulsion. These double-labelled cells are interpreted as having an axon which gives origin, presumably at spinal cord levels, to collaterals ascending to both the ipsilateral medulla and the contralateral thalamus. Systematic evaluation of the extent to which ascending pathways to various supraspinal targets originate from common spinal neurons may provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of ascending spinal systems. to identify simultaneously cells of origin of the two ascending systems and to appreciate better their topographical relationships, and to answer the question of whether at least some of these spinal neurons have axons which, by way of collateral branching, reach both targets.","HRP; horseradish peroxidase; TMB; 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine;",

The anterior commissure was sectioned in 6 of 10 animals undergoing surgery. Transfer was evaluated on 6 tactile tasks: 2 involving shape discrimination and 1 involving size discrimination trained to 90 correct responses in 100 trials; one easy task involving roughness discrimination trained to 14 correct responses in 15 trials; and 2 tasks involving threshold determinations for 75 per cent correct performance with stimuli differing in roughness or size. The findings tentatively suggest that in the absence of the corpus callosum the massa intermedia supports tactile transfer more effectively than does the posterior commissure; that no or almost no transfer occurs on combined division of the corpus callosum, posterior commissure and massa intermedia; and that the anterior commissure is not involved. Also, there is as much transfer for a given surgical group on tasks involving size instead of roughness discrimination; that for a given surgical group there is more transfer on easy than difficult tasks, that this last variable can perhaps be attributed not to the influence of task difficulty per se but to the relatively greater degree of overtraining with easy than with difficult tasks.",,

Phasic unit activity related to the cue stimuli (referred to as type II) was described previously in this region by Pragay et al. (25). Type II units can be differentiated into two subgroups based on the presence or absence of anticipatory activity in the prestimulus interval. We found that the responses of the type II units to the cue stimuli were smaller and more variable when the stimuli were presented passively in a nonperformance condition, which suggests that type II activity in the reticular formation is related to stimulus relevance. The anticipatory type II units also were studied in relation to a set to be ready to receive a relevant stimulus (preparatory attention). Preparatory sets developed easily in disjunctive fixed-interval tasks and are thought to be mediated by the reticular formation. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the anticipatory type II units play a role in directing attention to a stimulus in time.",RF; reticular formation; EOG; electrooculogram; EMR; eye movement-related; NTR; nontask-related; NPC; nonperformance condition; CNV; contingent negative variation;,

These connections turned out to be part of a parallel network reciprocally linking sensory structures to cortical and subcortical formations that, from anatomical and electrophysiological investigations, appear to be involved in the neural control of directionally oriented eye movements, as well as in the orientation of visual attention. In the macaque monkey, the caudal half of the STS is an important cortical station of the extrageniculo-striate visual system in which discrete visual areas have been identified. Among these, the MT area is reputed to play a key role in visual motion analysis because of the property of its neurons to selectively respond to the direction and speed of moving visual stimuli.

We classified cells in the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) layers according to (non)linearity of spatial summation, shock latency, and chromatic organization of center and surround. We also measured the spatial and temporal tuning to counterphasing and drifting sine wave gratings and tested for periphery effects. Our results showed that no strict laminar segregation existed for any cell property studied. Our results can be summarized as follows: 1. Most P layer cells showed a linear summation (98%) and color-opponent responses (80%), while other cells showed a nonlinear summation (Y-cells, 2%) and broad band responses (28%). In contrast, 37% of the M layer cells were linear summators and the remainder were nonlinear. Therefore, there are overlapping distributions of X- and Y- cells in P and M layers but not a strict segregation. 2. P layer cells had longer shock latencies than M layer cells. X-cells conducted more slowly (2.4 +/- 0.7 msec) than Y-cells (1.6 +/- 0.8 msec), but there were overlapping distributions. Latency shortened gradually, rather than abruptly, with increasing depth. 3. The first harmonic of X- and Y- cell responses was maximally sensitive to spatial frequencies of about 2 cycles/deg. Each type of cell modulated about a mean rate to a drifting grating, although Y-cells had higher distortion than X-cells. Response amplitudes to drifting gratings were higher for MX- and MY- than for PX-cells. No DC elevation to high spatial frequencies was seen. Spatial bandwidths averaged 2 to 5 octaves. X-cells were maximally tuned to temporal frequencies around 11 Hz, and Y-cells were tuned to about 19 Hz;. temporal bandwidths for both averaged 2.8 octaves. 4. Periphery effects were detected in 4% of the X-cells and 25% of the Y-cells. 5. These data indicate that gradual changes occur between dorsal and ventral layers: summation changes from linear to nonlinear; conduction latencies shorten; peak temporal tuning increases; response amplitudes increase; the periphery effect becomes more prevalent. Spatial tuning does not change. No strict laminar segregation or specificity exists for any of the properties that we studied.",,

In the mesencephalon, at the level of the mesencephalic-diencephalic junction, single riboflavin-like immunoreactive fibers were observed in its dorsal part, whereas a low density of immunoreactive fibers was found below the surface of the section and close to substantia nigra, and a high density was observed above the substantia nigra and close to the medial geniculate nucleus. In the thalamus, single riboflavin-like immunoreactive fibers were found in the ventral regions of the lateral posterior and the medial geniculate nuclei; a low density in the region located above the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and a high density in the ventral part of the pulvinar nucleus and in the region extending from this latter to the caudate nucleus. Immunoreactive fibers were not observed in the medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, hypothalamus, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Moreover, no riboflavin-like immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the monkey brain.

More recent work has begun to define a role of an increased excitability of neurons within the spinal cord in the generation of secondary hyperalgesia. The present study demonstrates increased responses of primate spinothalamic neurons following co-administration of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) and substance P (SP) by micro-iontophoresis. Wide dynamic range and high threshold STT neurons in laminae I-VI showed an increased frequency of discharges following application of NMDA which was characterized by a slow onset to peak discharge rate and a slow return to background levels of discharge. Combined application of NMDA with SP resulted in an enhancement of responses to NMDA that often long outlasted the administration of SP. This increase in response of the cells to NMDA was not produced by repeated application of NMDA alone or following combined application of NMDA with an SP analog. NMDA responses were reduced or prevented in all cases by co-application of an NMDA-receptor antagonist. Finally, long-lasting potentiation of NMDA responses by SP was paralleled by enhanced responses to mechanical stimulation of skin. It is proposed that a mechanism involving the combined synaptic release of excitatory amino acids and peptides leads to secondary hyperalgesia.",,

Resting monkeys with acute hemineglect following periarcuate lesions show deficient glucose utilization (LCGU) in motor thalamus and other loci of the hemisphere with the lesion. To determine if the abnormal LCGU could be altered by a specific behavioral task, we used behavioral testing and training, and quantitative 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Animals reached criterion in a bimanual traction task (BMTT), then were tested for hand preference and responses to sensory stimuli, and received unilateral frontal or sham lesions. Operated animals showed hemineglect, and, on BMTT, intermanual coordination errors. 2-DG of frontals at rest showed deficient LCGU in 4 of 7 thalamic, and 1 of 4 cortical regions assessed. In contrast, only 2 thalamic and no cortical regions were deficient in pulling animals. Thus, in the face of structural damage and distant deficient neural activation, performance of a specific behavioral task may increase metabolism in specific brain loci, implying that plasticity of neural activation vis-a-vis behavioral demand is present even acutely after brain injury.",Periarcuate cortex; Ventrolateral thalamus; Hemineglect; Diaschisis; Plasticity;,

A recently developed alternative to these methods is the use of optogenetic techniques, based on the expression of light sensitive channel proteins in neurons. While optogenetics have been applied in in vitro preparations and in in vivo studies in rodents, their use to study brain function in nonhuman primates has been limited to the cerebral cortex. Here, we characterize the effects of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) transfection in subcortical areas, i.e., the putamen, the external globus pallidus (GPe) and the ventrolateral thalamus (VL) of rhesus monkeys. Lentiviral vectors containing the ChR2 sequence under control of the elongation factor 1α promoter (pLenti-EF1α -hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE, titer 109 particles/ml) were deposited in GPe, putamen and VL. Four weeks later, a probe combining a conventional electrode and an optic fiber was introduced in the previously injected brain areas. We found light-evoked responses in 31.5% and 32.7% of all recorded neurons in the striatum and thalamus, respectively, but only in 2.5% of recorded GPe neurons. As expected, most responses were time-locked increases in firing, but decreases or mixed responses were also seen, presumably via ChR2-mediated activation of local inhibitory connections. Light and electron microscopic analyses revealed robust expression of ChR2 on the plasma membrane of cell somas, dendrites, spines and terminals in the striatum and VL. This study demonstrates that optogenetic experiments targeting the striatum and basal ganglia-related thalamic nuclei can be successfully achieved in monkeys. Our results indicate important differences of the type and magnitude of responses in each structure. Experimental conditions such as the vector used, the number and rate of injections, or the light stimulation conditions have to be optimized for each structure studied.",,

Stimulation of the medial (fastigial) cerebellar nucleus produced, at a latency of 4–5 msec, deep thalamo-cortical (T-C) responses (surface positivedeep negative potentials) mainly in the medial part of the precentral gyrus (area 4, “motor area for hindlimb”) and in the superior parietal gyrus (area 5) on both contralateral and ipsilateral sides to the nucleus stimulated. Stimulation of the lateral (dentate) cerebellar nucleus elicited, at a latency of about 3 msec, superficial T-C responses (surface negative-deep positive potentials) predominantly in the lateral part of the precentral gyrus (area 4, “motor area for forelimb and face”) and in the rostromedial part of the gyrus (area 6, premotor area) on the contralateral side. Stimulation of the interpositus cerebellar nucleus set up superficial T-C responses chiefly in the motor area between those influenced by the medial and the lateral cerebellar nucleus stimulation and also in the premotor area on the contralateral side. The respective areas responsive to the medial, interpositus and lateral nucleus stimulation overlapped considerably each other in the motor cortex. Comparison of the responses in the cortex induced by stimulation of the cerebellar and thalamic nuclei indicated different relay portions in and around the VA-VL region of the thalamus for the superficial and the deep T-C responses respectively.

The mechanism by which STN DBS elicits its beneficial effect, however, remains unclear. We previously reported STN stimulation increased the rate and produced a more regular and periodic pattern of neuronal activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). Here we extend our observations to neurons in the pallidal [ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) and ventralis anterior (VA)] and cerebellar [ventralis lateralis posterior pars oralis (VPLo)] receiving areas of the motor thalamus during STN DBS. Stimulation parameters that produced improvement in rigidity and bradykinesia resulted in changes in the pattern and power of oscillatory activity of neuronal activity that were similar in both regions of the motor thalamus. Neurons in both VA/VLo and VPLo tended to become more periodic and regular with a shift in oscillatory activity from low to high frequencies. Burst activity was reduced in VA/VLo, but was not significantly changed in VPLo. There was also a significant shift in the population of VA/VLo neurons that were inhibited during STN DBS, whereas VPLo neurons tended to be activated. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that STN DBS increases output from the nucleus and produces a change in the pattern and periodicity of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia thalamic network, and that these changes include cerebellar pathways likely via activation of adjacent cerebello-thalamic fiber bundles.","STN, MPTP, thalamus, DBS, oscillation, pattern",

To examine how OcTh contributes to visuomotor control, and perceptually informed saccadic choices in particular, neural correlates of perceptual judgment and motor selection in OcTh were evaluated and compared with those previously reported for FEF in the same subjects. Monkeys performed three tasks: a choice task in which perceptual decisions are urgent, a choice task in which identical decisions are made without time pressure, and a single-target, delayed saccade task. The OcTh yielded far fewer task-responsive neurons than the FEF, but across responsive pools, similar neuron types were found, ranging from purely visual to purely saccade related. Across such types, the impact of the perceptual information relevant to saccadic choices was qualitatively the same in FEF and OcTh. However, distinct from that in FEF, activity in OcTh was strongly task dependent, typically being most vigorous in the urgent task, less so in the easier choice task, and least in the single-target task. This was true for responsive and nonresponsive cells alike. Neurons with exclusively motor-related activity showed strong task dependence, fired less, and differed most patently from their FEF counterparts, whereas those that combined visual and motor activity fired most similarly to their FEF counterparts. The results suggest that OcTh activity is more distantly related to saccade production per se, because its degree of commitment to a motor choice varies markedly as a function of ongoing cognitive or behavioral demands.","decision making, discrimination, gaze, frontal eye field, mediodorsal nucleus, saccade",

We studied the visual response properties of 348 neurons recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys aged 1 week to adult. We measured spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves and contrast responses with drifting achromatic sinusoidal gratings. Even in animals as young as 1 week, the main visual response properties of neurons in the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the LGN were qualitatively normal, including the spatial organization of receptive fields and the characteristic response properties that differentiate M- and P-cells. At 1 and 4 weeks, spatial and temporal resolution were less than one-half of adult values, whereas contrast gain and peak response rates for optimal stimuli were about two-thirds of adult values. Adult levels were reached by 24 weeks. Analysis of correlations between S-potentials representing retinal inputs and LGN cells suggested that the LGN follows retinal input as faithfully in infants as in adults, implicating retinal development as the main driving force in LGN development. Comparisons with previously published psychophysical data and ideal observer models suggest that the relatively modest changes in LGN responses during maturation impose no significant limits on visual performance. In contrast to previous studies, we conclude that these limits are set by neural development in the visual cortex, not in or peripheral to the LGN.","macaque monkey, lateral geniculate nucleus, development, vision, spatial, temporal",

to 3 Hz spike and wave electroencephalograph (EEG) after discharge pattern, was obtained by thalamic stimulation in monkeys with bilaterally symmetric aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) lesions in anterior premotor cortical areas. The characteristic behavioral and EEC features associated with absence seizures appeared reproducibly, 63 ± 5 days after aluminum hydroxide cortical implantation. This test system distinguishes between anticonvulsants that are effective in generalized seizures of the absence type and anticonvulsant drugs that are effective in focal seizures. Clinically useful antiabsence drugs, such as ethosuximide, sodium valproate, clonazepam, and trimethadione, are effective in this model. Diphenylhydantoin, which is contraindicated in absence states, increases the spike and wave after-discharge pattern. The limitations, advantages, and potential usefulness of this model in predicting anti-absence activity as well as the incidence of side effects of new drugs is discussed.",Absence; Spike and wave discharge; Rhesus monkey; Aluminum hydroxide; Anticonvulsants; Thalamus;,

J Neurosci Methods 1997;76:203–210), we showed that a simple back propagation neural network could reliably model visual inspection by human observers in detecting the point of change of neuronal discharge patterns. The data for that study was deliberately chosen so that the point of change was readily detected and there would be high concordance between human observers. We wished to extend this investigation by comparing a variety of automatic analysis methods on more complex data sets. Two automatic analysis methods have been discussed in this paper. The knowledge based spike train analysis (KBSTA) was designed to emulate the detection of bursts by human observers. The self-organizing feature map (SOFM) spike train analysis determined a burst by classifying the patterns of neuronal discharge. Neuronal discharge was recorded from the motor thalamus and nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis caudalis (VPLc) of a monkey performing consecutive trials of skilled wrist movements. Recordings were made from 36 neurons whose discharge patterns were related to wrist movement. Three hundred and sixty trials performed during the recording of these 36 neurons were chosen at random and used to compare the three methods, KBSTA, SOFM, and visual inspection. The main results of this study show that for the 360 trials the three detection methods have very similar results in detecting the onset and offset of neuronal bursts. The SOFM method is not the best first approach for detecting a burst, but it does provides independent evidence to support the KBSTA and visual inspection methods. In conclusion we propose the KBSTA method as a practical, automatic technique to identify bursts of neuronal discharge.",Spike train analysis; Automatic detection; Knowledge based system; Fuzzy logic; Neural network; Visual inspection;,

Normal and degenerating cells were counted in Nissl-stained sections by using video-enhanced differential interference contrast optics and videooverlay microscopy. Before embryonic day 60 (E60), the geniculate nucleus contains 2,200,000 ± 100,000 neurons. Roughly 800,000 of these neurons are eliminated over a 40- to 50-day period spanning the middle third of gestation. Neurons are lost at an average rate of 300 an hour between E48 and E60, and at an average rate of 800 an hour between E60 and E100. Very few neurons are lost after E100, and as early as E103 the population has fallen to the adult average of 1,400,000 ± 90,000. Degenerating neurons are far more common in the magnocellular part of the nucleus than in the parvicellular part. In 20 of 29 cases, the number of neurons is greater on the right than on the left side. The right-left asymmetry averages about 8.5% and the difference is statistically significant (X2 = 38, p< .001). The period of cell death occurs before the emergence of cell layers in the geniculate nucleus, before the establishment of geniculocortical connections, and before the formation of ocular dominance columns (Rakic, 76). Most important, the depletion of neurons in the geniculate nucleus begins long before the depletion of retinal axons. The number of geniculate neurons is probably a key factor controlling the number of the retinal cells that survive to maturity.",,

Although a critical structure in the motor circuit, the role of the motor thalamus in mediating the therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is not fully understood. To characterize the changes in neuronal activity in the pallidal (ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) and ventralis anterior (VA)) and cerebellar (ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo)) receiving areas of the motor thalamus during therapeutic GPi DBS. Neuronal activity from the VA/VLo (n = 134) and VPLo (n = 129) was recorded from two non-human primates made parkinsonian using the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. For each isolated unit, one minute of data was recorded before, during and after DBS; a pulse width of 90 μs and a frequency of 135 Hz were used for DBS to replicate commonly used clinical settings. Stimulation amplitude was determined based on the parameters required to improve motor signs. Severity of motor signs was assessed using the UPDRS modified for nonhuman primates. Discharge rate, presence and characteristics of bursts, and oscillatory activity were computed and compared across conditions (pre-, during, and post-stimulation). Neurons in both the pallidal and cerebellar receiving areas demonstrated significant changes in their pattern of activity during therapeutic GPi DBS. A majority of the neurons in each nucleus were inhibited during DBS (VA/VLo: 47% and VPLo: 49%), while a smaller subset was excited (VA/VLo: 21% and VPLo: 17%). Bursts changed in structure, becoming longer in duration and both intra-burst and inter-spike intervals and variability were increased in both subnuclei. High frequency oscillatory activity was significantly increased during stimulation with 33% of VA/VLo (likelihood ratio: p < 0.0001) and 34% of VPLo (p < 0.0001) neurons entrained to the stimulation pulse train. Therapeutic GPi DBS produced a significant change in neuronal activity in both pallidal and cerebellar receiving areas of the motor thalamus. DBS suppressed activity in the majority of neurons, changed the structure of bursting activity and locked the neuronal response of one-third of cells to the stimulation pulse, leading to an increase in the power of gamma oscillations.

It has been argued that the primary site of drug action in inducing chorea is the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. In the present study, the neural mechanisms which underlie this experimental dyskinesia were investigated by two separate approaches. First, the efferent projections of the lentiform complex were mapped using neuroanatomical tracing techniques. This involved injecting horseradish peroxide into sites which had previously given chorea when injected with the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Secondly, the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) metabolic mapping technique was applied to animals during active dyskinesia. This procedure permitted the autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral glucose uptake which was used as an index of regional synaptic activity. In both instances, the strongest labelling was seen in the dorsolateral region of the subthalamic nucleus. On the basis of this finding it is suggested that the pallidosubthalamic pathway plays a crucial role in the mediation of experimentally-induced chorea. Specifically, the pallidosubthalamic pathway arising from the lateral pallidal segment is abnormally overactive, which causes physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus. The pattern of 2-DG uptake in the medial segment of the globus pallidus and thalamus was similar to that seen in animals with experimentally-induced ballism. This similarity is interpreted as suggesting that a common neural mechanism underlies both experimentally-induced chorea and ballism.",,

Attempts were made to determine fastigial projections in the monkey using autoradiographic tracing technics. Cells in rostral, caudal and all parts of the FN were labeled with [3H] amino acids. Selective labeling of neurons in either rostral or caudal parts of the FN results in transport of isotope primarily via fibers of the contralateral uncinate fasciculus (UF) and the ipsilateral juxtarestiform body (JRB). Fastigial projections to the vestibular nuclei are mainly to ventral portions of the lateral (LVN) and inferior (IVN) vestibular nuclei, are nearly symmetrical and are quantitatively similar on each side. Fastigiovestibular projections to cell groups f and x arise from all parts of the FN and are mainly crossed; modest projections to the medial vestibular nucleus are uncrossed. No fastigial efferent fibers end in the superior vestibular nucleus on either side, or in dorsal regions of the LVN. Crossed fibers descending in IVN terminate in the nucleus parasolitarius. Fastigioreticular fibers arise predominately from rostral regions of the FN, are entirely crossed and project mainly to: (1) medial regions of the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, (2) the dorsal paramedian reticular nucleus and (3) the magnocellular part of the lateral reticular nucleus. Fastigiopontine fibers, emerge with the UF, bypass the vestibular nuclei and terminate upon the contralateral dorsolateral pontine nuclei. Crossed fastigiospinal fibers separate from fastigiopontine fibers and descend in the ventrolateral tegmentum beneath the spinal trigeminal tract; in the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord these fibers are intermingled with those of the vestibulospinal tract. Fastigiospinal fibers terminate in the anterior gray horn at C-1 and probably descend further. Ascending fastigial projections arise from caudal parts of the FN, are entirely crossed and ascend in dorsal parts of the midbrain tegmentum. Label is transported bilaterally to the superior colliculi and the nuclei of the posterior commissure. Contralateral fastigiothalamic projections terminate in the ventral posterolateral (VPLc and VPLo) and in parts of the ventral lateral (VLo) thalamic nuclei. The major region of termination of fastigiothalamic fibers is in VPLo. Fastigiothalamic projections, probably conveying impulses concerned with equilibrium and somatic proprioception, appear to impinge upon thalamic neurons receiving inputs from less specialized receptors that signal information concerning position sense and body movement. More modest fastigial projections to VLo could directly influence activity of neurons in the primary motor cortex.",,

Intensity-response curves of cells of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus were measured using a successive contrast paradigm where chromatic or achromatic stimuli were presented in alternation with a white adaptation field of constant luminance. Adding white surround annuli around stimuli and adaptation field shifted the intensity-response curves to higher intensity ranges. Since response curves can be non-monotonic, this remote surround effect can result in an increase or decrease in responsiveness (facilitation or suppression) dependent on stimulus intensity.

These differential effects suggest the presence of multiple ionotropic non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors in the primate ventral posterior (VP) thalamus.

Four and six days after axotomy, marked chromatolytic alterations and diminution of rough endoplasmic reticulum were noted in 89 examined neurons of medium or large size, with rich cytoplasmic matrix, large mitochondria, and exhibiting only postsynaptic sites on the perikarya and dendrites. Seventeen other neurons showing no signs of degeneration had a pale matrix, small dense mitochondria and both postsynaptic and presynaptic sites on their perikarya and dendrites. It was concluded that the former group represented P-cells and the latter was characteristic of I-cells. The morphologic criteria derived from this study were applied to the quantitative analysis of neuronal populations in separate magnocellular and parvocellular laminae. The findings indicate that the latter contain 4.4% of I-cells whereas the former have 15.6% of this neuronal category. The dissimilarity suggests the more preeminent role of I-cells in the magnocellular laminae where they could maintain the transient responses of Y-cells which are known to be the predominant population among the P-cells of these laminae.",,

Prior to the movement, surface negative — deep positive slow potential changes appeared in the motor and premotor cortices contralateral to the moving hand. The potential changes started about 1 s before the hand movement and increased gradually to about 100 ms before the movement. The contours of the potential changes preceding the movement were remarkably constant in daily recording for several weeks. Based on the laminar field potential analyses of cortical evoked potentials made in previous acute experiments, the slow potential was interpreted to be due to the currents of slowly increasing EPSPs that were generated in superficial parts of the cortical pyramidal neurons via certain thalamocortical projections. The EPSPs would activate the neurons in the motor and premotor cortices and contribute to the initiation of voluntary movement.",EPSP; excitatory postsynaptic potential; EOG; electrooculogram; EMG; electromyogram; S; surface record; D; deep record;,

The majority of the sample was recorded from within laminae IV-V. The temporal features of the responses to noxious thermal stimulation of glabrous and hairy skin were studied in an attempt to determine whether natural groupings of STT neurons could be identified on the basis of response time course alone and whether these groups were skin type dependent. The relationship between these groups and those based on static response features (37) was also explored in an attempt to define more fully their potential functional roles. In most STT neurons, the thermally evoked responses typically appeared to have two response components, particularly at stimulus temperatures above 49 degrees C. The first response phase typically peaked within 1-12 s of stimulus onset and then adapted. The second phase slowly rose to a maximum, typically 15-30 s following stimulus onset. The existence of natural groupings of STT neurons based upon the characteristics of these two response components was assessed with a k-means cluster analysis. On the basis of the onset and early peak latencies, two well-defined short and long latency neuronal clusters were found in the responses evoked from both glabrous and hairy skin; these were referred to as the SP1 and LP1 classes, respectively. The glabrous and hairy skin SP1 classes did not differ significantly in either onset or early peak latency for stimuli of 47-55 degrees C. However, the hairy skin LP1 class had significantly shorter onset latencies than the glabrous skin LP1 class for stimuli of 49-53 degrees C, as well as shorter peak latencies for stimuli of 49 and 51 degrees C. The SP1 class constituted 62% of the hairy skin subset, whereas the LP1 class constituted 57% of the glabrous skin subset. A cluster analysis of the late-peak latencies also revealed two subgroups. In the responses evoked from both glabrous and hairy skin, the longer latency classes (LP2) constituted more than 80% of the samples. With one exception, no dependence upon the type of skin that was stimulated was found in the latencies of either the LP2 class or the shorter latency SP2 class. Prior conditioning of the skin with a 30-s thermal pulse of 51-55 degrees C led to a suppression of the early response phase and an enhancement of the late phase in nearly all cases examined (n = 11). This pattern was independent of skin type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

The directafferent projections to FEF from NOT could provide a route for visual inputto reach FEF via the pretectum without first going to the visual cortex.

Thalamic RI values showed stronger association with serum and spectroscopy lactate values than those in the ACA. The UCO + hypothermia group demonstrated a significant increase in RI in the thalamus, but not the ACA.

Electromyographs (EMGs) of several limb muscles were recorded together with Pu unit activity. The effect of active and passive limb movements was studied. Pu responses were also recorded during stimulation with flashes and clicks. A high percentage of units (65%) modified their discharge rate with limb movements. Firings showed a rate modulation in relation to specified movement phases, which were characteristic of each individual unit. Firing rates correlated with movement parameters, strongly with velocity and amplitude, and less with force. Firing rate modulation depth correlated better than mean rate changes with movement parameters, implying that dynamic information is well represented while static parameters are less important. Most of the movement-related units showed visual or auditory responses. A visuo-auditory and motor response was demonstrated in a few cells.

In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with a Fink-Heimer modification of the Nauta method. We hoped to correlate the laminar distribution of axon terminals in the cortex with functional differences between layers, and to demonstrate the IVth-layer mosaic anatomically. After lesions in either of the two most dorsal (parvocellular) layers, terminal degeneration was found mainly in layer IVc, with a second minor input to a narrow band in the upper part of IVa. A very few degenerating fibers ascended to layer I. In contrast, lesions in either of the two ventral (magnocellular) layers were followed by terminal degeneration confined, apparently, to IVb, or at times extending for a short distance into the upper part of IVc; no degeneration was seen in layer IVa or in layer I. After a lesion confined to a single geniculate layer, a section through the corresponding region of striate cortex showed discrete areas or bands of degeneration in layer IV, usually 0.5–1.0 mm long, separated by interbands of about the same extent in which there was no terminal degeneration. When serial sections were reconstructed to obtain a face-on view of the layer-IV mosaic, it appeared as a series of regular, parallel, alternating degeneration-rich and degeneration-poor stripes. When a geniculate lesion involved both layer VI (the most dorsal, with input from the contralateral eye) and the part of layer V directly below (ipsilateral eye), the cortical degeneration, as expected, occupied a virtually continuous strip in layer IVc and the reconstructed face-on view of this layer showed a large confluent region of degeneration. In some of the reconstructions the cortical stripes seemed highly regular; in others there was a variable amount of cross connection between stripes. The stripes varied in width from 0.25 to 0.50 mm, and width did not seem to correlate with region of retinal representation. It is concluded that the long narrow stripes of alternating left-eye and right-eye input to layer IV are an anatomical counterpart of the physiologically observed ocular-dominance columns. Because of this segregation of inputs, cells of layer IV are almost invariably influenced by one eye only. A cell above or below layer IV will be dominated by the eye supplying the nearest IVth layer stripe, but will generally, though not always, receive a subsidiary input from the other eye, presumably by diagonal connections from the nearest stripes supplied by that eye.",,

Retinal ganglion cells maintain their sensitivity despite this variation using two adaptive mechanisms, which control how responses depend on luminance and on contrast. However, the nature of each mechanism and their interactions downstream of the retina are unknown. We recorded neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in anesthetized adult male macaques and characterized how their responses adapt to changes in contrast and luminance. As contrast increases, neurons in the magnocellular layers maintain sensitivity to high temporal frequency stimuli but attenuate sensitivity to low-temporal frequency stimuli. Neurons in the parvocellular layers do not adapt to changes in contrast. As luminance increases, both magnocellular and parvocellular cells increase their sensitivity to high-temporal frequency stimuli. Adaptation to luminance is independent of adaptation to contrast, as previously reported for LGN neurons in the cat. Our results are similar to those previously reported for macaque retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that adaptation to luminance and contrast result from two independent mechanisms that are retinal in origin.","contrast, gain control, LGN, luminance, temporal frequency",

This segregation of large and small cells is not maintained in the primary visual cortex (V1); instead a heterogeneous mixture of cells occurs, particularly in the output layers. Nevertheless, our results indicate that for the middle and upper layers of V1, cell size remains a predictor of physiological properties. We recorded extracellularly from neurons in V1 of alert monkeys and analyzed the amplitude, duration, and polarity of the action potentials of 199 cells. Of 156 cells that could be assigned to specific cortical layers, 137 (88%) were localized to the middle and upper cortical layers, layer 4 and above. We summarize evidence that the large-amplitude spikes are discharged by large cells, whereas small-amplitude spikes are the action potentials of smaller cells. Large spikes were predominantly negative and of longer duration, whereas small spikes were predominantly positive and briefer. The putative large cells had lower ongoing activity, smaller receptive field activating regions and higher selectivity for stimulus geometry and stimulus motion than the small cells. The contrasting properties of the large and the small cells were illustrated dramatically in simultaneous recordings made from adjacent cells. Our results imply that there may be an anatomic pairing or clustering of small and large cells that could be integral to the functional organization of the cortex. We suggest that the small and the large cells of area V1 have different roles, such that the small cells may shape the properties of the large output cells. If some of the small cells are also output cells, then cell size should be a predictor of the type of information being sent to other brain regions. Because of their high activity and relative ease of stimulation, the small cells also may contribute disproportionately to in vivo images based on metabolic responses such as changes in blood flow.",,

Using immunocytochemical labeling and preembedding immunoperoxidase and silver-enhanced immunogold electron microscopy, we localized T-channel subunit Cav3.3 in rodent cerebral cortex and thalamus. Double immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that Cav3.3-labeled neurons in cerebral cortex are a subgroup of GABAergic interneurons that coexpress calbindin and in half of the cases parvalbumin. In the thalamus, virtually all reticular nucleus (RTN) neurons were immunopositive for Cav3.3, while neurons in dorsal thalamic nuclei were nonimmunoreactive. At the electron microscopic (EM) level, in cortical layers IV–V and RTN neurons, Cav3.3 immunoreactivity was mainly associated with membranes of dendrites but with some localization in cytoplasm. None was found in axon terminals. In cortex, ≈73% of immunogold particles were present in close proximity to synaptic contacts (<0.5 μm from the postsynaptic density), while 27% were distributed along membranes at extrasynaptic sites (>0.5 μm from the postsynaptic density). In RTN, ≈57% particles were evenly distributed along perisynaptic membranes and the remaining 43% of particles were diffusely localized at extrasynaptic membranes. The density of particles along the dendritic membranes of cortical neurons was 40% higher than in RTN neurons. These results suggest that Cav3.3 plays a role in regulating GABAergic neurons whose actions underlie thalamocortical rhythmicity. J. Comp. Neurol. 519:1181–1195, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Calcium influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in plasma membranes plays a vital role in controlling and regulating many important neuronal functions, including neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity (Miller, 1988; Kennedy, 1989; Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). One type of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, the low-threshold Ca2+ channel (T-type channel), is sensitive to membrane potential fluctuations and is activated when the membrane potential is changed from hyperpolarized to a depolarized direction and crosses a certain threshold (around −70 mV) (Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984; Huguenard, 1996; Perez-Reyes, 2003). Activation of T-channels generates rhythmic firing which is crucial for setting oscillations in thalamocortical circuitry and is essential for maintaining normal thalamocortical functions such as the sleep-wake cycle (McCormick and Bal, 1997; Beenhakker and Huguenard, 2009). Malfunction of T-type channels underlies certain neurological diseases such as absence epilepsy (McCormick and Bal, 1997; Destexhe et al., 1998, 2007; Perez-Reyes, 2003; Chen et al., 2003; Broicher et al., 2008). Recent studies have identified three T-channel subunits: Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3, encoded by different genes. Expression studies show that all three subunits exhibit distinct localization patterns in the brain, suggesting diverse functional roles (Talley et al., 1999; Lein et al., 2007). Immunocytochemical studies have partly confirmed gene expression data but were mostly limited to the light microscopic level (Yunker et al., 2003; McKay et al., 2006). Two recent immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrated the subcellular localization of Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 in neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) in cat (Kovacs et al., 2010) and of Cav3.1 in relay neurons of mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (Parajuli et al., 2010). The majority of studies dealing with T-channel function in thalamocortical circuitry have been carried out in rodents (Lambert et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2001), but there have been no studies analyzing the subcellular localization of Cav3.3 T-channels in rodents. Among inhibitory neurons, those in the cerebral cortex exhibit firing patterns markedly different from those in the RTN (McCormick and Bal, 1997; Cruikshank et al., 2010) and this may be related to differential channel distribution along somatodendritic compartments. In the present study we used immunocytochemical labeling to identify cortical and thalamic neurons which specifically express Cav3.3 by combining preembedding silver-enhanced immunogold and preembedding immunoperoxidase labeling with electron microscopy (EM)."

Areas lower in the hierarchy send information through feedforward connections to higher areas. Higher areas modulate the activity in lower areas by means of feedback connections, and thereby influence the local processing as well as the information they receive. Although this scheme is well accepted, the exact role of feedforward and feedback connections in cognition is still poorly understood, let alone the mechanisms by which they mediate their effects. A report by Self et al. (1) in PNAS sheds light on the mechanisms involved. They delineate the different receptor types that contribute to feedforward and to feedback processing. They recorded neuronal activity from macaque primary visual cortex (V1) while animals performed a figure-ground detection task. V1 neurons in awake animals show differential activity depending on whether they represent the figure (2, 3) or whether they represent the background, even if the image within their receptive field is identical under both conditions. This differential activity is known as figure-ground modulation, and it depends on feedback from higher areas (4). Based on modeling studies (5, 6), studies from anesthetized animals (7), and the known receptor properties (8), Self et al. (1) hypothesize that the main stimulus-driven response of the V1 neurons will be mediated by glutamatergic AMPA receptors, whereas the figure-ground modulation will be largely mediated by glutamatergic NMDA receptors. They tested this hypothesis by applying AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists on some of their trials and studied which aspects of the neuronal response were affected by selective receptor blockade. Blockade of AMPA receptors reduced the neuronal activity overall, but it had very little effect on figure-ground modulation. This supports the idea that the main stimulus drive, which is carried by feedforward connections, is reliant on glutamate’s action on AMPA receptors (Fig. 1). However, it equally suggests that AMPA receptors have little role in figure-ground modulation. Intriguingly, blockade of NMDA receptors selectively reduced the figure-ground modulation, although it had relatively little effect on the stimulus-driven activity. This is an important study, one of only a few directly investigating specific receptor contributions to cognitive function (9–11), and it demonstrates a special role of NMDA receptors in feedback-mediated activity. Cartoon of glutamatergic ionotropic receptor involvement in figure-ground coding. A figure-ground stimulus is displayed at the bottom. Self et al. (1) train monkeys to report whether a figure is present on any given trial and simultaneously record neuronal activity across different layers in V1. The example shows a trial in which a figure would have been present, and nonfigure trials would show an isooriented structured image in which the center stimulus would be unchanged and the surround stimulus would have an orientation identical to the center. V1 neurons, representing parts of the figure, showed higher activity on figure trials than on nonfigure trials. This elevated activity is called figure-ground modulation; it occurs in a somewhat delayed manner relative to response onset and is highlighted in blue in the central histogram. Self et al. (1) demonstrate that figure-ground modulation was almost entirely abolished when NMDA receptors (NMDAr) were blocked in V1, whereas the feedforward component of the response (red curve) was largely unaffected. Conversely, blocking AMPA receptors did not affect the figure-ground modulation, but it strongly reduced the feedforward response component (not shown). The results are convincing, but it is extremely unlikely that feedback connections target synapses containing exclusively NMDA receptors or that feedforward connections target synapses containing exclusively AMPA receptors, a fact that the authors themselves discuss (1). We do know that this is not the case (12). Even so, the results suggest that feedback connections target synapses especially rich in NMDA receptors, whereas feedforward connections target synapses especially rich in AMPA receptors. It will be important, even if difficult, to verify this by combining tract-tracing, ultrastructural, and immune-histochemical methods in macaque monkeys. Figure-ground segmentation is only one of many cognitive functions that rely on feedback connections. Attention is possibly the most studied cognitive function, wherein feedback connections influence neuronal processing in sensory cortex (13–16). A recent paper reported that muscarinic, rather than NMDA, receptors are vital for attentional rate modulation in primary visual cortex (9). This does not contradict the study by Self et al. (1), because a joint role for cholinergic and NMDA mechanisms in attention-mediated rate modulation is possible. Modeling suggests that acetylcholine simply adjusts the network properties, such that feedback, possibly acting through NMDA-rich synapses, can induce attentional modulation in V1 (17). Attention affects a variety of neuronal signatures in sensory areas. It alters neuronal firing rate (18, 19), similar to the rate modulation that Self et al. (1) study, but it also alters the strength of oscillatory activity (20, 21), it reduces rate variability (22), and it reduces firing rate correlations in pools of neurons (23, 24). We currently do not know whether figure-ground segmentation has equivalent effects on these higher order statistics of neuronal activity, and whether these are equally dependent on NMDA receptor activation. This short list of questions highlights how little we know regarding the neuropharmacology of cognition at the cellular level. Self et al. (1) make an important contribution toward filling the knowledge gaps.",,

As reported previously, early surface-positive, depth-negative (2.5–3 mm depth from the cortical surface) premovement potentials emerged at about 40 ms latency after onset of the light stimulus bilaterally in premotor and forelimb motor areas. Early potentials in the forelimb motor area contralateral to the moving hand were followed at about 120 ms latency by surface-negative, depth-positive late premovement potentials which are considered to be mainly composed of superficial thalamo-cortical (T-C) responses. Unilateral hemispherectomy of the cerebellum contralateral to the motor area immediately eliminated the surface-negative, depth-positive potentials. Reaction time from onset of the light stimulus to the hand movement was prolonged by 90–250 ms after cerebellar hemispherectomy. If the dentate and interpositus nuclei were also lesioned, disappearance of the late potentials and delay of the movement continued for many months. However, if the interpositus was spared, there was earlier recovery of reaction time with simultaneous reappearance of the late premovement potentials in the motor cortex. The conclusion is drawn that the cerebellar hemisphere (neocerebellum) activates the motor cortex via superficial T-C projections and participates directly in the initiation of reaction movements in response to an external stimulus.",,

The animals searched for a small target pattern within an array of varying numbers of irrelevant patterns. After receiving colliculus lesions, the animals showed marked postoperative increases in either search time, percent errors, or both. By contrast, pulvinar lesions had little or no effect on visual search performance. Similarly, in learning to search for a target they had not previously seen, animals with colliculus lesions were impaired relative to unoperated controls, whereas pulvinar-lesioned animals did not differ from controls. In an attempt to confirm the finding that pulvinar lesions impair tachistoscopic pattern discrimination, we determined exposure-duration thresholds of pulvinar- and colliculus-lesioned monkeys for performance of a pattern discrimination. The thresholds of the colliculus-lesioned monkeys were elevated 20-fold relative to controls. By contrast, thresholds of the pulvinar-lesioned monkeys were normal. We conclude that the pulvinar is not critical for the attentional processes in which the superior colliculus participates.",,

Within the forelimb area of the motor cortex itself, there are extensive and profuse interconnections. However, regions within this area receive afferents from very few neurons in other parts of the motor cortex representing hindlimb or head movements. Most of the motor cortical representation of the forelimb in the anterior bank of the central sulcus is devoid of callosal connections. In both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, the premotor (lateral area 6) and supplementary motor (medial area 6) areas dominate quantitatively the inputs to the motor cortical representation of the forelimb. The afferents from the premotor area are restricted and come from a region immediately behind the arcuate spur and adjacent parts of the superior and inferior limbs of the arcuate sulcus in the floor, caudal bank, and caudal lip of that sulcus. From the supplementary motor area (SMA), afferents originate from its whole rostrocaudal extent. Thalamic nuclear regions projecting to a restricted zone in the anterior bank of the central sulcus are recipients of cerebellar and somatosensory outputs. Involvement of more anterior parts of the motor cortex by the tracer labels thalamocortical cells, which are targets of pallidal output also. Within the first somatosensory cortex, cytoarchitectonic areas 1, 2, and 3a project to area 4.

It has been suggested that this segregation may account for the known differences in visual function between the parietal and temporal cortical processing streams in extrastriate visual cortex. To test directly the hypothesis that the temporal stream of processing receives predominantly parvocellular signals, we recorded visual responses from the superficial layers of V1 (striate cortex), which give rise to the temporal stream, while selectively inactivating either the magnocellular or parvocellular subdivisions of the LGN. Inactivation of the parvocellular subdivision reduced neuronal responses in the superficial layers of V1, but the effects of magnocellular blocks were generally as pronounced or slightly stronger. Individual neurons were found to receive contributions from both pathways. We furthermore found no evidence that magnocellular contributions were restricted to either the cytochrome oxidase blobs or interblobs in V1. Instead, magnocellular signals made substantial contributions to responses throughout the superficial layers. Thus, the regions within V1 that constitute the early stages of the temporal processing stream do not appear to contain isolated parvocellular signals. These results argue against a direct mapping of the subcortical magnocellular and parvocellular pathways onto the parietal and temporal streams of processing in cortex.",,

The pattern of CytOx stain has been used to investigate the maturation of thalamic input to areas V1 and V2 in the newborn monkey. In both areas, the intensity of CytOx activity was similar in newborns and adults. The distribution of CytOx in area V2 was not found to vary with age. In area V1, the only difference in CytOx activity in newborns was a relative immaturity of staining in layer 4C. The callosal connections of visual areas V1 and V2 were investigated by the axonal transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and free horseradish peroxidase. In the adult, V1 was found to be reciprocally callosally connected for a distance of 1–2.5 mm from the
border, whilst V2 was connected for a distance of 3–8 mm from the border. In both areas, callosal connections showed a certain degree of clustering, particularly in V2 which contained 97–98% of the total number of callosal connections of these two areas. In the newborn, the number, tangential extent and clustered distribution of callosal connections were as in the adult. In the newborn, as in the adult, callosal connections coincided with regions of high CytOx activity in area V2. The results showing a relative maturity of the tangential distribution of callosal projecting neurons on the one hand, and an immaturity of thalamic projections on the other, are discussed in terms of: (1) the maturational status of the newborn monkey compared to other mammals at the moment of birth and (2) the possible role of visual experience in shaping cortical connections.",Development; Cortical connection; Vision; Primate;,

At this transition, layers 4 and 6 fuse into a single layer, as do layers 3 and 5, requiring an inversion of the stacking order of the cell categories making up layers 4 and 5. To understand the topology of this transition and its relationship to geniculate retinotopy, we have created a functional atlas of a rhesus LGN that affords three-dimensional views of morphology and retinotopy at a resolution of 25 μm. The projection of the path of the transition into visual space is highly biased toward lower visual fields, intersecting the upper vertical meridian at 6.4°, the horizonal meridian at 15.4°, and the lower vertical meridian at 25.0°. Between inclinations of −31° and 55°, layers 3 and 5 merge through an elongated tear in layer 4 that subsumes the optic disk gap and extends medially and laterally; elsewhere, layers 4 and 6 merge through a tear in layer 5. These tears cause substantial violations of retinotopy and laminar integrity, so the inversion of layers 4 and 5 requires that the forces establishing retinotopy and grouping by cell class be locally overcome during morphogenesis. The transition and associated tears are evaluated in the context of recent computational models of geniculate morphogenesis. We have also used the atlas to estimate the borders of the binocular (55 ≈ 62°) and monocular (91 ≈ 97°) visual fields. Files containing the atlas are made publicly available on a website. J. Comp.

By examining the color chips with methods used by neural response researchers and the LGN cells with methods used by psychophysical color researchers, we obtain insights that may be useful for advancing knowledge in both fields. For LGN cells, the prevailing view is that they tend to be clustered into distinct types or along discernible lines or planes when data obtained from selected light stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space derived from cone contributions. In contrast, the Munsell color chips are viewed as rather evenly distributed in a three-dimensional perceptual space based on the psychophysical judgment of surface colors. We demonstrate that, when the Munsell chips are viewed in the space typically applied to LGN cells, the distribution appears similar to that of the cells and vice versa. We show why this result occurs and suggest that it has implications for studies in both fields.","vision, color perception",

The results are summarized as follows:
(1) Only anterior part of the parvocellular subdivision of the medial geniculate (GMpcA) projects to the auditory koniocortex (primary auditory area — A I. The anterior GMpcA projects posteriorly in konicortex while the posterior GMpcA projects more anteriorly. The medial portion of GMpcA has connection to medial koniocortex while lateral GMpcA projects more laterally.
(2) The posterior portion of the parvocellular medial geniculate (GMpcP) sends projections mainly to the rostal parakoniocortex — ‘auditory association area’.
(3) The projections to the second auditory area (A II) originate either from medial GMpcA or from GMmc (magnocellular portion of the medial geniculate nucleus).
(4) No specific projections from the suprageniculate subdivision (SG) of the medial geniculate complex to either A I and A II or to the remainder of the temporal operculum were found. The possibility of such projections to the insula and the parietal operculum cannot be excluded from the present investigation.
(5) GMmc may send projection to the retroinsular parietotemporal cortex (ReIpt), which on anatomical ground can be homologized to the vestibular area of cat.

We found no difference between the responses of LGN neurons under rivalrous and nonrivalrous conditions, as determined by examining the ratios of their respective power spectra. There was, however, a curious “temporal afterimage” effect in which cell responses continued to be modulated at the drift frequency of the grating for several seconds after the grating disappeared.",Binocular vision; Rivalry; Macaque monkey; Lateral geniculate nucleus;,

Little is known concerning the processing of innocuous thermoreceptive information in the CNS of the monkey. The aim of the present study was to confirm the prediction, based on recent studies in cat and monkey, that there must be a prominent spinothalamic (STT) projection of cooling-specific spinal cord lamina I neurons to the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) of the monkey thalamus. 2. Experiments were performed on four cynomolgus monkeys anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. A detailed mapping of somatosensory thalamus was performed in each animal, and VMpo was identified by recordings from clusters of thermoreceptive-specific and nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons. Stimulating electrodes were then implanted in VMpo. Tungsten microelectrodes were used to record the responses of neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the lumbosacral spinal cord. 3. Many spontaneously active lamina I neurons were found that were inhibited by radiant warming and that responded to innocuous cooling of the hindpaw. These cooling-specific (COLD) neurons were excited by small temperature drops below skin temperature and increased their discharge with decreasing skin temperature. They were not excited by thermally neutral mechanical stimuli applied to the receptive fields. In passing, we also characterized with natural stimulation a few NS neurons reponsive to pinch and/ or noxious heat, multimodal (HPC) neurons responsive to noxious heat, pinch, and cold stimuli, and wide-dynamic-range neurons responsive to both innocuous and noxius cutaneous stimuli that were encountered in lamina I. 4. Twenty lamina I COLD cells were identified as STT neurons by antidromic activation from the contralateral VMpo. The mean conduction latency for these units was 26.1 ms, which corresponds to a mean conduction velocity of approximately 8.0 m/s. They were not antidromically activated from an electrode in the region of the ventral posterior nucleus in the thalamus. In addition, we antidromically activated from VMpo four NS units and three HPC cells. 5. These findings demonstrate for the first time the existence of a prominent direct projection of specific COLD lamina I STT cells to thalamus in the monkey. This is consistent with clinical inferences in humans and with prior results in cats. This result confirms that the dense lamina I STT projection to VMpo demonstrated in anatomic studies includes COLD cells, and it supports the role of VMpo as a thalamic relay nucleus for pain- and temperature-related information.",,

The cortical vestibular area was first identified in the cat by Walzl and Mountcastle with the evoked potential method. In this animal, the vestibular cortex is a small field between the auditory and the second somatic area. The juxtaposition to the auditory cortex was taken by several clinicians as confirmation of the temporal lobe hypothesis. However, just in the region between the second somatic and the auditory field the sylvian fissure has evolved in primates because of the large development of the association cortex. It was uncertain whether the vestibular projection went with the auditory to the temporal or with the somatosensory to the parietal lobe. Therefore, a study of the vestibulocortical projection in the Rhesus monkey was made. This chapter discusses on the location of the cortical vestibular area in the monkey, microelectrode investigations of single units in the cat's vestibular cortex, somatosensory-vestibular convergence in the vestibular cortex, motor cortex, and vestibular nuclei, functional interpretation of the vestibular cortex and of vestibulosomatic convergence, and vestibular representation in the thalamus.",,

However, these deficits may have resulted from damage to corticotectal fibers as they pass through the pulvinar. To evaluate this possibility and to determine whether kainic acid can be used to destroy pulvinar cells without damaging corticotectal fibers, we compared anterograde degeneration in the superior colliculus following kainic acid and radiofrequency lesions of the pulvinar. Kainic acid injections into the pulvinar produced total loss of neuronal perikarya within the inferior and lateral pulvinar. Four to 7 days following the kainic acid lesions, terminal and fiber degeneration within the superior colliculus was no greater than that produced by control injections of saline. By contrast, thermocoagulation lesions of the inferior and lateral pulvinar produced dense fiber and terminal degeneration throughout the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. We conclude that whereas thermocoagulation of the pulvinar severely damages the corticotectal tract, kainic acid lesions spare these fibers of passage. Thus kainic acid lesions should provide an effective tool for studying the functional significance of the pulvinar.",,

Each pathway processes information relevant to directed reaching tasks, but whereas VPLc receives its major input from the spinal cord and external environment, the primary afferent to the pulvinar is cortical. Using combined tracer and thick fixed slice procedures, the soma/dendritic morphology of TC neuron populations (with known destination) was shown to be quantitatively similar within VPLc and the pulvinar. This implies that differences in information processing in VPLc (a primary relay) and the pulvinar (an integrative thalamic nucleus) are not defined by a distinctive TC morphology, but rather by the connections of these neuron populations. Two morphologically distinct types of CT axon were observed within the medial pulvinar and VPLc. The more common “Type E” were fine, had boutons en passant and diffuse terminal bifurcations ending in masses of tiny boutons. “Type R” axons were thicker, smooth, and terminated in localised clusters of large terminal boutons. Each type had a unique pattern of termination reflecting a distinct action on target neuron populations. The spatial relationship between TC distribution territories and CT terminal fields was examined within the medial pulvinar and VPLc by using anterograde and retrograde tracers injected together within cortical areas 7a, and 3b/1, respectively. Spatial overlap was incomplete within both thalamic nuclei. Our findings show a more complex relationship between TC and CT neuron populations than previously demonstrated. J. Comp.

This required the animal to press for a red (positive) stimulus and to withhold responses to green or blue (negative) stimuli. The brain regions selected for this study were those which prior work had indicated were associated with stimulation-induced errors in performance. The present results indicated that stimulation which induced omission errors in performance (not responding to the positive stimuli) was typically associated with reduction in the amplitude of visually evoked potentials, whereas stimulation which induced commission errors (responding to the negative stimuli) tended to be associated with increase in visually evoked potential amplitude. Error-related potential changes were not systematically related to changes in activation level as measured by the amount of fast activity in the electroencephalogram. Omission error-related potential decrease effects were most often elicited by stimulation of the mesopontine reticular formation and commission error-related potential increase effects were scattered over a wide range of subcortical structures. These results are in agreement with those of prior evoked potential investigations of this region of the brain, and may have some relevance to the pathophysiological events occurring in human petit mal epilepsy.",,

II. Activity of Thalamic Relay Neurons in Delayed Conditional Go/No-Go Discrimination Task,"The present report investigated the involvement of primate nigro-thalamo-cortical projections in discrimination of visual signals with behavioral meaning. We tested the extracellular unit activity of mediodorsal (MD) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamic neurons monosynaptically receiving inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and projecting to the frontal cortex in Japanese monkeys performing a delayed conditional go/no-go discrimination task. In the task two colored stimuli (S1, S2) intervened by delay period required the monkeys lifting a lever (go) or not (no-go); the same and different colored pairs of S1 and S2 meant go and no-go signals, respectively. Prominent task-relevant responses were sustained activity with color preference to S1 during delay period and S2-related activity with different firing rates between go and no-go trials. In particular, a high proportion of such go/no-go differential S2-related activity was found in thalamic relay neurons, receiving input from the caudolateral SNr and projecting to the prefrontal area (PSv) ventral to the principal sulcus, in the rostrolateral MD. The findings suggest that the caudolateral SNr–rostrolateral MD–PSv pathways may be possible conduits of signals coding the behavioral meaning of the visual stimuli and thus may be responsible for generating similar neuronal activity in the PSv.",,

Although medical treatment is effective in most cases, resistance is observed in about 30% of patients. In this context, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the caudate or subthalamic nuclei has been recently proposed with encouraging results. However, some patients were unimproved or exhibited awkward side effects. Therefore, exploration of new targets for DBS remains critical in OCD. In the latter, functional imaging studies revealed overactivity in the limbic and associative cortico-subcortical loops encompassing the thalamus. However, the role of the thalamus in the genesis of repetitive behaviors and related anxiety is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological-induced overactivity of the medial thalamus could give rise to abnormal behaviors close to that observed in OCD. We modulated the ventral anterior (VA) and medial dorsal (MD) nuclei activity by in situ bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) microinjections in subhuman primates and assessed their pharmacological-induced behavior. Bicuculline injections within the VA caused significant repetitive and time-consuming motor acts whereas those performed within the MD induced symptoms of dysautonomic dysregulation along with abnormal vocalizations and marked motor hypoactivity. These findings suggest that overactivation of the VA and MD nuclei of the thalamus provokes compulsive-like behaviors and neurovegetative manifestations usually associated with the feeling of anxiety in OCD patients. In further research, this translational approach should allow us to test the effectiveness and side effects of these thalamic nuclei DBS in monkey and perhaps, in a second step, to propose a transfer of this technique to severely disabled OCD patients.","monkey, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pharmacological manipulations, thalamus",

Eye and head movements were recorded with the scleral search coil technique using phase angle detection in a homogeneous electromagnetic field. In the visual search task all three animals showed a neglect for stimuli presented in the field contralateral to the lesion. In two animals the neglect disappeared within 2-3 wk. One animal had a lasting deficit. We found that FEF lesions that are restricted to area 8 cause only temporary deficits in eye and head movements. Up to a week after the lesion the animals had a strong preference to direct gaze and head to the side ipsilateral to the lesion. Animals tracked objects in contralateral space with combined eye and head movements, but failed to do this with the eyes alone. It was found that within a few days after the lesion, eye and head movements in the direction of the target were initiated, but they were inadequate and had long latencies. Within 1 wk latencies had regained preoperative values. Parallel with the recovery on the behavioral task, head movements became more prominent than before the lesion. Four weeks after the lesion, peak velocity of the head movement had increased by a factor of two, whereas the duration showed a twofold decrease compared with head movements before the lesion. No effects were seen on the duration and peak velocity of gaze. After the recovery on the behavioral task had stabilized, a relative neglect in the hemifield contralateral to the lesion could still be demonstrated by simultaneously presenting two stimuli in the left and right visual hemifields. The neglect is not due to a sensory deficit, but to a disorder of programming. The recovery from unilateral neglect after a FEF lesion is the result of a different orienting behavior, in which head movements become more important. It is concluded that the FEF plays an important role in the organization and coordination of eye and head movements and that lesions of this area result in subtle but permanent changes in eye-head coordination.",,

Labeled LGN cells were identified only in the animals with HRP injections into the striate and prestriate cortex. Following injections into either of these regions, labeled cells were found in both parvocellular and magnocellular regions of the ipsilateral LGN only, in keeping with the topographic relation of HRP injection sites in the cortex to labeled areas in the LGN. It was also found that (1) labeled LGN cells were less numerous in both laminar and interlaminar zones following HRP injection into the prestriate cortex, whereas following HRP injection into the striate cortex labeled cells were found almost exclusively in the laminae, and localized to a wedge-shaped region; (2) following HRP injection into the prestriate cortex, the mean sizes of the labeled parvocellular and magnocellular cells, estimated in projected diameter, were almost the same, these means being significantly larger than the mean size of labeled parvocellular cells and much smaller than that of labeled magnocellular cells following HRP injection into the striate cortex; (3) the shapes of the labeled LGN cells following HRP injection into the prestriate cortex were ovoid, fusiform, or triangular (or multipolar), whereas those following HRP injection into the striate cortex were uniformly ovoid or round. The above findings following HRP injections into the prestriate cortex in normal monkeys were confirmed by HRP injections into the prestriate cortex of monkeys whose striate cortex had been removed several months prior to the injection; labeled cells were found in the confines of areas of retrograde degeneration in the LGN and their labeling pattern was the same as that in intact animals. It was concluded that in macaque monkeys, just as in the cat, a geniculoprestriate projection system exists; it was suggested that there are two parallel systems of visual information processing from the LGN to the prestriate cortex, a direct one and an indirect one through the striate cortex.",,

IV. Critical structures for lightvs. no-light discrimination,"The purpose of the study was to determine which brain structures were critical for the capacity to perform a gross luminous flux discrimination in the absence of striate cortex. Fourteen monkeys were trained to a criterion of successful performance, set at 90% correct responses in 30 consecutive trials, on a light vs. no-light discrimination test, using specially designed automatic equipment which allowed predetermination of Gellerman schedules. All monkeys were able to relearn the test after complete bilateral excision of striate cortex and partial ablation of areas 18 and 19 (histologically verified). Additional bilateral lesions of the temporal neocortex, or posterior parahippocampal and retrosplenial allocortex, or pulvinars, or superior colliculi did not interfere significantly with the relearned habit. Instead, when the additional damage involved the superior colliculi and medial pretectum, there was a major discrimination deficit, but eventually these monkeys could reach the criterion level. Only when the lateral pretectal region was included in the latter lesion was there a failure to master the test in 6000 trials of postoperative testing. The effective damage caused bilateral severe degeneration of the nucleus of the accessory optic tract. Findings indicate that the mesodiencephalic junction contains critical structures for extrageniculostriate vision in the monkey and suggest that the accessory optic system could be one main source of visual input for the capacity to perform luminous flux discrimination tests in the absence of striate cortex.",,

The maps for spatial location and ocular dominance originate from the spatial arrangement of thalamic axons in cortex. However, the origin of the other maps remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the cortical maps for orientation, direction and retinal disparity are all strongly related to the organization for spatial location of light (ON) and dark (OFF) stimuli, an organization that we show is OFF-dominated, OFF-centric and runs orthogonal to ocular dominance columns. Because this ON/OFF organization originates from the clustering of ON and OFF thalamic afferents in visual cortex, we conclude that all main features of cortical topography, including orientation, direction and retinal disparity, follow a common organizing principle that arranges thalamic axons with similar retinotopy and ON/OFF polarity in neighboring cortical regions.",,

The presence of magnocellular inputs to a given cortical cell was deduced from its responses to a battery of tests, including assessment of achromatic contrast sensitivity, relative strengths of chromatic and luminance borders in driving the cell at different velocities and conduction velocity of their retino-geniculo-cortical afferents. At least a quarter of the cells in our cortical sample appear to receive convergent P and M inputs. We cannot however, exclude the possibility that some of these cells could be receiving a convergent input from the third parallel channel from the dLGN, namely the koniocellular (K) rather than the P channel. The neurons with convergent P and M inputs were recorded not only from supragranular and infragranular layers but also from the principal geniculate input recipient layer 4. Thus, our results challenge classical ideas of strict parallelism between different information streams at the level of the primate striate cortex.",,"In the primate retino-geniculate-cortical pathway, three distinct parallel information channels have been described which carry retinal information to the primary visual cortex (striate cortex, cytoarchitectonic area 17 or area V1), namely the parvocellular (P), the magnocellular (M) and koniocellular (K) channels (for reviews see Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; Casagrande & Norton, 1991; Goodale & Milner, 1992; Lachica et al., 1992; Casagrande & Kaas, 1994; Casagrande, 1994; DeYoe et al., 1994; Lund et al., 1994; Callaway, 1998). The P, M and K pathways originate from morphologically distinct classes of retinal ganglion cells and relay in parallel through anatomically distinct layers in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (reviewed by Kaplan et al., 1990) to the primary visual cortex. The P and M channels on which the great majority of the studies to date have concentrated, are postulated to remain largely segregated not only in the striate cortex (Bullier & Henry, 1980; Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; Casagrande & Norton, 1991; Casagrande & Kaas, 1994) but also in their projections from the striate to the extra-striate visual areas (Shipp & Zeki, 1985; Maunsell & Newsome, 1987; DeYoe & Van Essen, 1985, 1988; Livingstone & Hubel, 1988; Zeki, 1993; DeYoe et al., 1994). Indeed, it has been suggested that visual information processing proceeds from the striate cortex along two major streams: one of them, the so-called dorsal stream, carries largely the magnocellular information to the parietal cortex via a number of extrastriate visual areas, while the other stream, the so-called ventral steam, again via a number of extrastriate visual areas, carries largely the parvocellular information to the inferotemporal cortex. However, recent anatomical and functional data indicate that there might be a degree of convergence of these pathways in the extrastriate areas (Maunsell et al., 1990; Ferrera et al., 1992, 1994; Merigan & Maunsell, 1993; Gegenfurtner et al., 1996; Kiper et al., 1997). Recent anatomical data also indicate that the first level of convergence between the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways may occur as early as layer 4 of the striate cortex, the major input layer for the geniculate afferents. The anatomical substrate for such interaction is evident in the dendritic and axonal arborizations of neurons in layers 4Cα and 4Cβ (Lund et al., 1994; Levitt et al., 1994; Yoshioka et al., 1994; Yabuta & Callaway, 1998). Furthermore: (i) projection neurons in layer 3B of striate cortex, which until recently were believed to send exclusively P type information to the ventral stream, receive substantial direct excitatory input from layer 4Cα, that is, from M pathway (Sawatari & Callaway, 2000); and (ii) pyramidal neurons in layer 4B, which is generally believed to provide an exclusive relay of M information channel to the dorsal stream, appear to receive (Yabuta et al., 2001) strong direct excitatory inputs from both layers 4Cα (M pathway) and 4Cβ (P pathway). In the present study, we have examined the issue of functional convergence of P and M information channels in the primary visual cortex by recording the activity of single cells in the anaesthetized macaque's striate cortex and examining their responses for the presence of specific signatures of magnocellular and/or parvocellular inputs. In the diurnal primates such as macaque monkeys, an important criterion for revealing the presence of a parvocellular input to the cortical cell is the presence of responses to chromatic, isoluminant contours and spectral selectivity. There is a large body of evidence indicating that in macaque monkeys magnocellular cells in the retina and the dLGN are generally colour-blind (e.g. Wiesel & Hubel, 1966; Dreher et al., 1976) and do not respond to isoluminant chromatic stimuli (Schiller & Colby, 1983; Hubel & Livingstone, 1990; for review, see Kaplan et al., 1990). Therefore, we took the presence of responses to isoluminant stimuli and spectral selectivity of cortical neurons we recorded from as clear indications of a P input. The converse is however, not true, namely, the lack of response to isoluminant stimuli does not necessarily indicate that the cell lacks P inputs. To detect the presence of the suprathreshold magnocellular input to a cortical cell, we had to use a battery of tests. One of our criteria was the low contrast threshold for an optimal achromatic stimulus, usually, a single moving bar or a flashing spot. It has been shown that the contrast sensitivity of the M cells in the dLGN is usually much higher than that of the P cells (Kaplan & Shapley, 1982; Hicks et al., 1983; Derrington & Lennie, 1984; Shapley, 1990). Indeed, P cells rarely respond to sine wave gratings of less than 10% contrast, whereas M cells often respond to contrasts as low as 1–3% (Hicks et al., 1983; Shapley, 1990). Furthermore, neurons in the principal magno-recipient layer 4Cα of the macaque striate cortex have high luminance-contrast sensitivities while those in the principal parvo-recipient layer 4Cβ exhibit low luminance-contrast sensitivities. (Blasdel & Fitzpatrick, 1984; Hawken & Parker, 1984; Tootell et al., 1988; Hubel & Livingstone, 1990). However, because in virtually all studies (e.g. Kaplan & Shapley, 1982; Hicks et al., 1983; Derrington & Lennie, 1984; Shapley, 1990) the contrast sensitivity of parvo- and magnocellular geniculate neurons was assessed on the basis of their responsiveness to moving gratings while in the present study we have assessed contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons on the basis of their responsiveness to optimally oriented moving bars, we have conducted additional control experiments by recording single neuron activity from the parvocellular as well as from the magnocellular geniculate layers and determining their achromatic contrast thresholds for single bars. A small number of cells located in the intralaminar regions of the dLGN, that is, the so-called koniocellular cells was also examined. The second test for revealing the presence of an M input to a cortical neuron was based on the conduction velocity of their direct or indirect geniculate afferents. Retino-geniculate M fibres are faster conducting than the retino-geniculate P fibres (Dreher et al., 1976; Schiller & Malpeli, 1978). Furthermore, the geniculo-cortical M fibres are faster conducting than the geniculo-cortical P fibres (Bullier & Henry, 1980). We have ascertained whether a cell had an excitatory M input or not, by measuring the difference in the orthodromic latencies of the responses of cortical neurons to single electrical stimuli delivered by electrodes placed in the optic radiation (OR) in close proximity to the dLGN and in the optic chiasma (OX). The latency difference of responses resulting from electrical stimulation of OX and OR sites reflect the conduction times of the retino-geniculate fibres relaying through the dLGN and, as mentioned above, these are distinctly different for the M and P pathways. One more test that we used to reveal the presence of P and M inputs to a cortical cell was to compare the cell responses to isoluminant chromatic contours and achromatic luminance contours moving at different velocities. Geniculate M cells respond well to achromatic contours moving across their receptive fields at velocities substantially higher than those which are effective in activating P cells in the dLGN (Dreher et al., 1976). This means that a striate cell can be presumed to receive converging P and M inputs, if it exhibits more vigorous responses to isoluminant chromatic stimuli at velocities much slower than those which are most effective for achromatic stimuli. Preliminary reports describing our results have been published in the form of abstracts (Vidyasagar et al., 1998a, b; Vidyasagar & Dreher, 2002)."

The cell bodies of the radiating neurons have a few delicate, somatic spines some of which are occasionally bilobed and trilobed. Five to eight dendritic trunks give rise to branching, tapering dendrites, which may extend for over 400 microns. These dendrites are much thinner than the dendrites in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. Some neurons have many and some neurons have few dendritic spines. When numerous the dendritic spines are concentrated on the dendritic trunks and proximal dendrites. The relatively few elongated fusiform neurons are found not only in the capsule but also in the center of the nucleus. Most dendrites emerge from the opposite poles of their smooth surfaced cell bodies. They have a few dendritic spines. Some of these dendrites extend for more than 750 microns. In 1-micron thick plastic sections lipofuscin granules are present in some but not all principal neuron cell bodies of the pig-tail monkey(Macaca mulatta); but these granules are present in all principal neuron cell bodies of the pig-tail monkey(Macaca nemestrina) and of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The local interneurons have small cell bodies and a few relatively long undulating dendrites. The dendrites have bulbous dendritic appendages of varying complexity and beaded axon- like processes. The dendritic appendages and axon-like processes are more numerous distally and on the distal ends of the dendrites they form complex entanglements. Axons coming from the cell body have not been observed. The cell bodies of the local interneurons are identified in cresyl violet stained sections of the monkey (Macaca mulatta), in 1-micron thick plastic sections and electron micrographs of the squirrel monkey(Saimiri sciureus). They have relatively large nuclei surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm rich in polyribosomes.",,

The area caudal and rostra1 to the rolandic sulcus does not yield movements upon stimulation. The results are summarized in this chapter, which also indicates those areas that produce upward and downward components as well. Most eye movements obtained under the conditions noted are saccadic in nature. The state of consciousness, whether asleep or awake, whether anesthetized or not, is an important factor in the results obtained in mapping the eye fields. The maps described in the present paper show a wider distribution of sensitive points than do others. Details of projections from different areas of the cortex cannot easily be outlined by physiological methods. If the excitable areas of the brain are stimulated via implanted electrodes in normal, unrestrained monkeys, the result is patterned head and eye movements along with appropriate body and limb movements. The results obtained during both acute and chronic experiments indicating widespread excitable brain areas and a variety of responses, show that conjugate eye movements are integral portions of many behavioral functions, including vision, audition, arousal, orientation, and defensive reactions, and, of course, postural and equilibrium motor behavior.",,

Of interest were the role played by various cell type, and the extent to which the sub-cortical interactions can quantitatively account for various aspects of vision.
1.Different cell types. Evidence was presented for the existence of six different cell types, two spectrally non-opponent and four spectrally opponent. Evidence for the way in which the three cone types feed into the six LGN cell types was presented.
2.Presence of color discrimination. The non-opponent cells were shown to be “colorblind”, showing to change in firing with a shift from an achromatic to an equal-luminance monochromatic light. Opponent cells all make such discriminations, and in each case are dichromatic.
3.Brightness discrimination. All six cell types respond to increments and decrements of achromatic light, but the non-opponent cells are the most responsive.
4.Wavelength discrimination. TheRG opponent cells discriminate wavelengths best around 600 nm, and theYB cells best around 500 nm, thus accounting for the double-minimum behavioral wavelength discrimination curve.
5.Saturation discrimination. Each opponent cell discriminates purity difference in certain spectral regions. The +R −G and +B −y cells are the most sensitive and the +Y−B least, thus accounting for the desaturation of the spectrum around 570 nm.
6.Simultaneous contrast and contours. Border enhancement is seen to luminance but not to pure color borders. The simultaneous contrast found in LGN cells extends only over very short distances, and thus cannot account for all perceptual contrast effects. 1.Different cell types.

What remains unclear is precisely how many separate pathways pass through the parvo- and magnocellular divisions of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), what relationships—homologous or otherwise—these pathways have to the cat's X, Y, and W pathways, and whether these are affected by visual deprivation. To address these issues of classification andtrans-species comparison, we used achromatic stimuli to obtain an extensive set of quantitative measurements of receptive field properties in the parvo- and magnocellular laminae of the LGN of nine macaque monkeys: four normally reared and five monocularly deprived of vision by lid suture near the time of birth. In agreement with previous studies, we find that on average magnocellular neurons differ from parvocellular neurons by having shorter response latencies to optic chiasm stimulation, greater sensitivity to luminance contrast, and better temporal resolution. Magnocellular laminae are also distinguished by containing neurons that summate luminance over their receptive fields nonlinearly (Y cells) and whose temporal response phases decrease with increasing stimulus contrast (indicative of a contrast gain control mechanism). We found little evidence for major differences between magno- and parvocellular neurons on the basis of most spatial parameters except that at any eccentricity, the neurons with the smallest receptive field centers tended to be parvocellular. All parameters were distributed unimodally and continuously through the parvo- and magnocellular populations, giving no indications of subpopulations within each division. Monocular deprivation led to clear anatomical effects: cells in deprived-eye laminae were pale and shrunken compared with those in nondeprived eye laminae, and Cat-301 immunoreactivity in deprived laminae was essentially uniformly abolished. However, deprivation had only subtle effects on the response properties of LGN neurons. Neurons driven by the deprived eye in both magno- and parvocellular laminae had lower nonlinearity indices (i.e., summed signals across their receptive fields more linearly) and were somewhat less responsive. In magnocellular laminae driven by the deprived eye, neuronal response latencies to stimulation of the optic chiasm were slightly shorter than those in the nondeprived laminae, and receptive field surrounds were a bit stronger. No other response parameters were affected by deprivation, and there was no evidence for loss of a specific cell class as in the cat.",,

It is likely that these difference are reflected in the topographic organization of the projection from these structures to area V1. We have investigated this issue by placing side-by-side injections of two retrograde fluorescent tracers, fast blue and diamidino yellow, in V1. By examining the extent of mixing of the two populations of singly labelled cells and the presence of doubly labelled cells, in different structures, we have characterized the topography of each projection in terms of the size of its axonal arborization and the amount of convergence and divergence. The afferents from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from the pulvinar are organized in a point-to-point fashion. The maximum extent of axonal arborization of these afferents is 0.5 mm and these projections demonstrate little scatter (i.e., neighboring LGN neurons project to adjacent regions of V1). The other two subcortical structures examined, the claustrum and the intralaminar nuclei, demonstrate a much larger scatter and wider axonal arborizations in their projections to V1 than do the LGN and pulvinar. Two-dimensional reconstructions were made of the distribution of labelled neurons in extrastriate cortical areas. Using the separation between patches of labelled cells and transitions in myelin-stained sections, we have identified seven separate cortical regions containing labelled cells. Two of these can be identified as area V2 and the middle temporal visual area (MT). Three other regions correspond to areas V3, V3A and V4t. Finally, two more regions of labelling have been distinguished that belong to area V4. These results demonstrate that, at least within the central 6° of visual field, all the presently known extrastriate visual cortical areas project to V1. This result is interesting in view of the fact that only a few extrastriate cortical areas are reported to receive afferents from V1. Three groups of cortical areas can be distinguished on the basis of the characteristics of their cortical connections to V1. The first group contains area V2, V3, and the posterior region of V4. These areas project to V1 with infra- as well as supragranular layer neurons and show limited axonal arborization and scatter in the projection. The second group consists of two regions of labelling in the superior temporal sulcus corresponding to V4t and MT and another on the annectant gyrus (V3A). These regions contain almost exclusively infragranular labelling and show wide axonal-arborization and scatter in their projections to V1. Finally, the neurons on the prelunate gyrus (V4) appear to have characteristics intermediate between the first two groups. Examination of the literature reveals that there is a relationship between the receptive field (RF) properties of neurons in different structures afferent to V1 and the geometry of their projection. Structures such as the LGN with small RF size and scatter display point-to-point projections to V1. Structures such as the claustrum or area MT that have larger RF size and greater scatter exhibit larger degrees of divergence in their projections to V1.",,

It has been suggested that there are two complete visuotopic maps in the PL/PIcl, each of which sends afferents into V2 and V4 in primates. Given that functionally distinct thin and thick stripes of V2 both receive inputs from the PL/PIcl, this raises the possibility of a presence of parallel segregated pathways within the PL/PIcl. To address this question, we selectively injected three types of retrograde tracers (CTB-488, CTB-555, and BDA) into thin or thick stripes in V2 and examined labeling in the PL/PIcl in macaques. As a result, we found that every cluster of retrograde labeling in the PL/PIcl included all three types of signals next to each other, suggesting that thin stripe– and thick stripe–projecting compartments are not segregated into domains. Unexpectedly, we found at least five topographically organized retrograde labeling clusters in the PL/PIcl, indicating the presence of more than two V2-projecting maps. Our results suggest that the PL/PIcl exhibits greater compartmentalization than previously thought.

These functions are strongly influenced by the subcellular and subsynaptic localization of Cav3 channels along the somatodendritic domain of thalamic cells. In Parkinson’s disease, T-type calcium channels dysfunction in the basal ganglia-receiving thalamic nuclei likely contributes to pathological thalamic bursting activity. In this study, we analyzed the cellular, subcellular, and subsynaptic localization of the Cav3.1 channel in the ventral anterior (VA) and centromedian/parafascicular (CM/Pf) thalamic nuclei, the main thalamic targets of basal ganglia output, in normal and parkinsonian monkeys. All thalamic nuclei displayed strong Cav3.1 neuropil immunoreactivity, although the intensity of immunolabeling in CM/Pf was significantly lower than in VA. Ultrastructurally, 70–80% of the Cav3.1-immunoreactive structures were dendritic shafts. Using immunogold labeling, Cav3.1 was commonly found perisynaptic to asymmetric and symmetric axo-dendritic synapses, suggesting a role of Cav3.1 in regulating excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Significant labeling was also found at non-synaptic sites along the plasma membrane of thalamic neurons. There was no difference in the overall pattern and intensity of immunostaining between normal and parkinsonian monkeys, suggesting that the increased rebound bursting in the parkinsonian state is not driven by changes in Cav3.1 expression. Thus, T-type calcium channels are located to subserve neuronal bursting, but also regulate glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic transmission along the whole somatodendritic domain of basal ganglia-receiving neurons of the primate thalamus.","centromedian, parafascicular, immunogold, primate, Parkinson’s disease, MPTP",

This hypothesis can be tested directly by selectively blocking transmission through either the magnocellular or parvocellular layers with small injections of lidocaine or GABA while recording cortical responses to a visual stimulus. In a previous study, we found that responses in the middle temporal visual area (MT) were almost always greatly reduced by blocks of magnocellular LGN, but that few MT neurons were affected by parvocellular blocks. In the present study, we have examined magnocellular and parvocellular contributions to area V4, which lies at the same level of processing in the cortical hierarchy as does MT and is thought to be a major recipient of parvocellular input. We found that inactivation of parvocellular layers usually resulted in a moderate reduction of visual responses (median reduction, 36%). However, comparable reductions in V4 responses were also seen following magnocellular blocks (median reduction, 47%). Directionally selective responses in V4 were not found to depend specifically on either subdivision. We conclude that area V4, unlike MT, receives strong input from both subdivisions of the LGN.

Retinofugal fibers terminated bilaterally in the suprachiasmatic, pregeniculate, lateral geniculate, olivary, pretectal, lateral terminal and dorsal terminal nuclei and the superior colliculi. In the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus, the retinofugal fibers terminated on laminae 0, 2, 3, and 5; in the contralateral nucleus, they ended in laminae 1, 4, and 6. In the superior colliculi, retinal terminals were aggregated in the stratum griseum superficiale. The ipsilateral suprachiasmatic nucleus showed a heavier labeling than the contralateral nucleus.",,

Three yielded a significantly greater proportion of drinking sites than expected from the earlier study, and one yielded significantly less. As the exploration proceeded, the proportion of sites yielding drinking greatly increased in the drinkers and decreased in the nondrinker, and the ratio of stimulus-bound to nonstimulus-bound drinking sites increased in the drinkers but decreased in the nondrinker. Orienting responses decreased in both drinker and nondrinker as exploration proceeded. Two sites that had reliably supported drinking in the restraint chair failed to do so when telestimulated in a free environment, but instead yielded turning, walking, and climbing behavior. The results suggest that ESB-elicited drinking is determined by stimulation of several overlapping neural systems. These probably include ascending dopaminergic and cholinergic systems which are relatively thirst specific, and a nonspecific, cholinergic component of the reticular activating system which triggers the animal to execute a prepotent response which is specific to a given animal with a given history of stimulation under particular environmental constraints. The learning of stimulus bound drinking is proposed to have its neural locus within the system which mediates the prepotent response, rather than in a thirst system or general activation system.",Electrical brain stimulation; Drinking; Environmental influences; Motivation; Rhesus monkey; Prepotent response;,

Here, we uncovered a parvocellular-specific molecule in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of higher mammals. We found that FoxP2 transcription factor was specifically expressed in X cells of the adult ferret dLGN. Interestingly, FoxP2 was also specifically expressed in parvocellular layers 3–6 of the dLGN of adult old world monkeys, providing new evidence for a homology between X cells in the ferret dLGN and parvocellular cells in the monkey dLGN. Furthermore, this expression pattern was established as early as gestation day 140 in the embryonic monkey dLGN, suggesting that parvocellular specification has already occurred when the cytoarchitectonic dLGN layers are formed. Our results should help in gaining a fundamental understanding of the development, evolution, and function of the parallel visual pathways, which are especially prominent in higher mammals.","ferret, FoxP2, monkey, parvocellular, X cells",

To test this idea, we trained monkeys to make visually-guided saccades by requiring them to detect the dimming of a small target. We used three different saccade paradigms. On single-step trials, saccades were made from a central fixation point (FP) to a target at 12, 24 or 36° to the left or right. On overlap trials, the FP remained lit during presentation of a target at 12 or 24°. On double-step trials, the target stepped first to 24°, and then back to 12° on the same side. Animals were trained to criterion, received kainic acid lesions of the pulvinar, and were retested on all three tasks. The lesions were very large, destroying almost all of the visually responsive pulvinar. They also encroached on the lateral geniculate nucleus, thereby producing small foveal scotomas, and this resulted in some behavioral changes, including difficulty in maintaining fixation on the target and in detecting its dimming. Results on the saccade tests suggest that the pulvinar is not crucial for initiation of saccadic eye movements. Saccade latency and amplitude were unimpaired on both single-step and overlap trials. Saccadic performance was also normal on double-step trials. In a second experiment, we measured the average length of fixations during spontaneous viewing of a complex visual scene. Fixation lengths did not differ from those of unoperated control monkeys. We suggest that the neglect, increased saccadic latencies, and prolonged fixations attributed to pulvinar damage in previous studies were probably the result instead of inadvertent damage to tectal afferents. The present results, together with single unit data, point to a role for the pulvinar not in the generation of saccades, but rather in the integration of saccadic eye movements with visual processing.",,

This account is based on EM study of normal material, LM and EM immunocytochemistry for GABA, anterograde tracing with HRP and EM of physiologically characterized interneurons intracellularly injected with HRP. It emerges clearly from this study that attempts to categorize flat-vesicle containing terminals in thalamic tissue as either F-boutons (axon terminals with flattened synaptic vesicles and Gray type II synaptic specializations) or P-boutons (dendritic appendages of interneurons with flattened vesicles) by examining only single sections are likely to produce unreliable results. In many cases it is only by studying serial sections that such profiles can be unambiguously identified. Within glomeruli the P-boutons participate in triplet (triadic) synapses which are thought to mediate rapid feed forward inhibition of projection cells, and serial synaptic arrays involving other P-boutons. Since P-boutons from more than one interneuron are present in individual VB glomeruli, P-bouton to P-bouton synapses may mediate disinhibition of interneurons. We show that dendritic shafts of interneurons make and receive synaptic contacts and that in the monkey, at least, reciprocal synaptic contacts between shafts or between a shaft and a P-bouton are not uncommon. Finally, we confirm that in the rat VB there are insignificant numbers of P-boutons or cells with the morphological and transmitter characteristics of interneurons and we suggest that comparative electrophysiological studies of inhibitory events in rat VB versus those in cat or monkey VB during transmission of somatosensory information might help to clarify the roles of thalamic intrinsic neurons.",,

Monocularly lid-sutured Macaca monkeys were also studied by quantitative EM methods to compare the synaptic organization within laminae innervated by the deprived and nondeprived retinae. We have divided our sample of Golgi-impregnated neurons into three groups: Types A, B, and C. Type A neurons comprise the majority of the projection cells and are quite heterogeneous in their overall morphology. Type B neurons have long dendrites with multiple appendages; some have a locally ramifying beaded axon. Type C neurons are characterized by dendrites which are mainly restricted to the interlaminar zones. We found Type A and B neurons in both the parvocellular and magnocellular laminae. The cell bodies of Type C neurons lay within the interlaminar zones or the parvocellular laminae. All three types contributed dendrites to the interlaminar zones. No significant differences in Golgi morphology other than overall size were found in parvocellular or magnocellular laminae that would explain the previously demonstrated electrophysiological differences. Terminal profiles and synapses in the parvocellular, magnocellular, and interlaminar zones were classified and counted using quantitative EM methods. RSD and F terminals were most numerous in all three zones. RLP terminals were rare in the interlaminar zones. A new type of terminal, RMD, was found in the magnocellular interlaminar zones. The laminar and interlaminar zones have the same overall synaptic density, but differed in types of synaptic terminals. The only quantitative difference between any of these regions was in the magnocellular laminae where the counts showed 70% more F terminals per unit area. The same quantitative methods were applied to the laminar and interlaminar zones of dLGNs from monocularly lid-sutured monkeys. We found no qualitative or quantitative difference between the synaptology of zones receiving input from the deprived retina compared to the open eye retina, nor between any regions of the dLGN in deprived monkeys compared to normal monkeys.",,

Many types of pyramidal cells of layers IIIB, V and VI have dendrites that consistently branch within the laminae of the thalamic axon terminations: The largest, most deeply situated layer IIIB pyramidal cells have basal dendrites which descend into layer IV of area 3b but become progressively more horizontally oriented in layer IIIB of areas 1–2 and 5. Some layer V pyramidal cells, particularly medium-to-large cells of layer VA, have apical dendrites which give off many branches and spines in both layer IV and layer IIIB of area 3b but only in layer IIIB of areas 1–2 and 5. Some of the modified pyramidal cells of layer VI give rise to apical dendrites that branch profusely in layer IV of area 3b and in layer IIIB of areas 1–2. Many of the non-pyramidal cell types have somata and dendrites among the thalamic afferent plexus. The small spiny (type 7) cells have their somata confined to layer IV of all areas but have an ascending dendritic tuft which is relatively short in area 3b, often barely reaching the upper border of layer IV, but is considerably longer in areas 1–2 and 5, reaching the layer IIIB/IIIA border. Several classes of small aspiny non-pyramidal cells have their somata in layers IIIB and IV of areas 3b and 1–2 but only in layer IIIB of area 5. Large, multipolar neurons (basket or type 1 cells) with somata in layers IIIB to VI of each area have dendrites that branch extensively either in layers IIIB and IV or at the layer V/VI border. It is concluded that virtually all pyramidal cells in layers IIIB, V and VI have substantial dendritic ramifications among the terminations of thalamic afferents. The dendrites of many pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells change their dendritic branching patterns and in some cases the positions of their somata, in a manner that conforms to the change in position of the thalamic afferent plexus from area to area. These observations suggest a close relationship between thalamic terminations and cell form, and may imply that all cells with dendrites among the thalamic terminations in monkey somatic sensory and parietal cortex receive significant numbers of thalamic synapses.",,

Four animals were unexpectedly found to have contralateral (i.e., secondary) EEG abnormalities (both ictal and interictal) which appeared to be indipendent in time of primary discharges. In all 4 of these monkeys the histological findings indicated to complete division of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior commissures, and of the massa intermedia. Possible mechanisms for the development of independent secondary discharging foci after commissure section were considered. Non-specific surgical effects were thought unlikely to be implicated. Instead it seemed most likely that the discharges spread neuronally from the primary to the secondary hemisphere by way of certain remaining pathways.",,

Unilateral tremor of the arm and leg was induced by electrical coagulation of the brainstem area including the substantia nigra and the red nucleus. The tremor was only seen at rest condition with a very stable frequency of 4.46±0.59 Hz (mean±S.D.). Apomorphine (0.1–0.4 mg/kg, s.c.) completely blocked the tremor, suggesting that it was a dopaminergic-dependent symptom just like the parkinsonian tremor. When the stimulating frequency varied from 20 to 1 000 Hz, both mono- and bipolar stimulation (square pulses, 0–5 mA, 0.06 ms) of the subthalamic nucleus suppressed resting tremor in a frequency-dependent manner but monopolar stimulation was more effective. These effects remained stable for more than two years. The present results suggest that the subthalamic nucleus is involved in the control and mechanism of resting tremor and that the high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus can be used as an alternative therapy in parkinsonian patients with akinesia, rigidity and resting tremor.","Parkinson's disease; tremor; basal ganglia; subthalamic nucleus; movement disorders; AC, anterior commissure; E, embryonic day; GPe, external segment of the globus pallidus; GPi, internal segment of the globus pallidus; HFS, high-frequency stimulation; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; P, postnatal day; PC, posterior commissure; RN, red nucleus; SN, substantia nigra; SNC, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNR, substantia nigra pars reticulata; STN, subthalamic nucleus; Vim, thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus;",

Following training, single, serial and simultaneous ablations of the lateral, medial and orbital prefrontal sectors were made. Simultaneous lateral-medial and orbital-medial decortications yielded significant impairments in the lever response and increases in affect. Single sector removal of the lateral, orbital or medial sector did not result in such changes. Combined orbital-lateral decortications resulted in no significant change in lever responding and slight increases in affect. Seriatim removal of sectors resulted in slight increases in affect with no change in lever responding as successive sectors were removed. Neither sham nor food controls showed any significant change in behavior. It is suggested that the impaired instrumental escape response and increased affect seen in the combined medial lesioned groups are the results of interruption of different pathways stemming from the prefrontal region, one passing to motor areas and the other to limbic structures.",,

Thus, we compared the regional and synaptic connections of vGluT2-positive thalamocortical glutamatergic terminals in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the primary motor cortex (M1) between control and MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. In controls, vGluT2-containing fibers and terminal-like profiles invaded layer II–III and Vb of M1 and SMA. A significant reduction of vGluT2 labeling was found in layer Vb, but not in layer II–III, of parkinsonian animals, suggesting a potential thalamic denervation of deep cortical layers in parkinsonism. There was a significant difference in the pattern of synaptic connectivity in layers II–III, but not in layer Vb, between M1 and SMA of control monkeys. However, this difference was abolished in parkinsonian animals. No major difference was found in the proportion of perforated versus macular post-synaptic densities at thalamocortical synapses between control and parkinsonian monkeys in both cortical regions, except for a slight increase in the prevalence of perforated axo-dendritic synapses in the SMA of parkinsonian monkeys. Our findings suggest that disruption of the thalamic innervation of M1 and SMA may underlie pathophysiological changes of the motor thalamocortical loop in the state of parkinsonism.","electron microscopy, nonhuman primates, Parkinson’s disease, thalamus, vGluT2 AB_2315569",

The majority of the sample was recorded from within laminae IV-V. The responses of STT neurons to noxious thermal stimulation of glabrous and hairy skin were studied in an attempt to identify a neural substrate for the differences in thermal sensation evoked by noxious stimulation of these two types of skin. In addition, the responses to graded mechanical stimuli were examined for evidence of differential sensitivity. Thermal intensity-response functions were constructed from the alteration in the mean discharge rate produced by a 30-s thermal pulse of 43-55 degrees C. Generally, the functions derived from stimulation of both hairy and glabrous skin were either linear or positively accelerating. Deceleration in the response functions was occasionally observed above 53 degrees C. The population mean discharge rate derived from glabrous skin stimulation was significantly greater than that derived from hairy skin stimulation above 49 degrees C. Cluster analysis was used to assess whether the STT population could be partitioned into functionally relevant subgroups. No clustering was evident on the basis of the alteration in discharge rate during stimulation alone. Analysis of the alteration in mean discharge rate during and following thermal stimulation identified four groups; these were referred to as the Amnr, Bmnr, Cmnr, and Dmnr classes. The clustering was not dependent on differences in the responses evoked from hairy and glabrous skin. The mechanical and thermal sensitivities of each thermal class covaried. The capacity of the STT population to code the quality of noxious thermal stimuli, as judged by changes in the across-neuron discharge pattern, was assessed with a multidimensional scaling technique (MDS). The results suggest that the population discharge could be used to order stimuli correctly from 45 to 55 degrees C. Also, it was found that a substantial change in the population's discharge pattern occurred to stimuli between 47 and 49 degrees C when delivered to hairy skin. A similar alteration in the population's discharge pattern occurred to glabrous skin stimuli near 51 degrees C. These alterations in population behavior may underly the alterations in sensory quality in humans that occur in these temperature ranges when stimulating hairy and glabrous skin. The possible roles of the thermally and mechanically based classes in thermal intensity and quality coding were examined. Within the lower intensity ranges (less than 49-51 degrees C), the Cmnr and Dmnr classes appeared to be best suited to intensity coding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Further, neural mechanisms specifically tuned for non-cardinal colors largely do not emerge until the cortex; therefore, the use of gratings should better reveal non-cardinal color mechanisms. This hypothesis has been tested in the isoluminant color plane in macaque monkeys (Stoughton, Lafer-Sousa, Gagin, & Conway, 2012) and in the L–M versus L+M color plane in human subjects (Gegenfurtner & Kiper, 1992). Here, this hypothesis was tested in the third color plane, S versus L+M, in human subjects in two experiments. Experiment 1 tested 10 subjects across four directions in this color plane; Experiment 2 tested three subjects in eight to twelve color directions. Consistent with data from the other two color planes, in both experiments in the S versus L+M color plane, gratings revealed the presence of non-cardinal mechanisms more strongly than did spots.","non-cardinal color, cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus, psychophysics",

I. early components,"Averaged somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded in the monkey from arrays of surface electrodes overlying the brain, cervical cord and peripheral nerve; from epidural electrodes over the cerebral convexity; and from movable intracerebral electrodes. The initial cortically generated responses peak at mean latencies of 10 and 12 msec following stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Preceding these potentials 5 small positive wavelets were identified in scalp and epidural recordings. The sources of the latter three of these waves have been identified, based in part on the observation of amplitude maxima in depth recordings within cerebrum and brain stem. P7.2 is primarily generated within the thalamocortical radiations, whereas P5.3 and P6.2 reflect bursts of highly synchronized action potentials travelling along the medial lemniscus. Recordings of multiple unit activity within these tracts confirmed the source identifications made on the basis of potential distribution. Continuing activity within the more caudal portions of the somatosensory pathways produces potentials that sum with those generated more rostrally. This circumtances precludes the identification of the intracranial source of a surface recorded potential by demonstrating a concurrent wave form at a single location within the brain. It is necessary to examine the intracranial potential distribution and trace the potential from the surface to its maximum in order to identify its source with confidence. P3.1 and P3.8 were identified only as farfield potentials in intracranial recordings from the pons and more rostral regions. They were ascribed to activity of primary somatosensory neurons ascending in the dorsal columns on the basis of their timing, surface distribution and amplitudevs. interstimulus interval functions. The early SEP components recorded in the monkey closely resembled in configuration and topography those recorded from human subjects, although the latter were longer in latency, reflecting difference in length of the somatosensory pathways in the two species.",,

We examined the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to see whether surviving neurons, within the region that shows retrograde degeneration as a result of the cortical lesion, project to remaining striate cortex and/or to extrastriate cortex. Neurons labelled from extrastriate cortex were found throughout the degenerated region, whereas neurons labelled from striate cortex were confined to the border between the normal and degenerated region of the nucleus. This shows that isolated neurons found within the degenerated region survive striate cortex damage because they project to an extrastriate visual area, and not because their terminals depart from the otherwise strict topographic representation of the lateral geniculate nucleus on to striate cortex.",,

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of TTP has been described, including regulation by microRNA-29a. In the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV CNS disease, control of cytokine/chemokine expression coincides with the end of acute phase infection. This control is lost during progression to disease. In this study, we assessed TTP regulation and association with cytokine regulation in the brain during SIV infection. Quantitation of TTP expression over the course of SIV infection revealed downregulation of TTP during acute infection, maintenance of relatively low levels during asymptomatic phase, and increased expression only during late-stage CNS disease, particularly in association with severe disease. The ability of miR-29a to regulate TTP was confirmed, and evidence for additional miRNA targeters of TTP was found. However, increased miR-29a expression in brain was not found to be significantly negatively correlated with TTP. Similarly, increased TTP during late-stage disease was not associated with lower cytokine expression. TTP expression is regulated during SIV infection of the CNS. The lack of significant negative correlation of miR-29a and TTP expression levels suggests that while miR-29a may contribute to TTP regulation, additional factors are involved. Reduced TTP expression during acute infection is consistent with increased cytokine production during this phase of infection, but the increases in TTP observed during late-stage infection were insufficient to halt runaway cytokine levels. While antisense inhibitors of the post-transcriptional targeters of TTP identified here could conceivably be used further to augment TTP regulation of cytokines, it is possible that high levels of TTP are undesirable. Additional research is needed to characterize members of the miRNA/TTP/cytokine regulatory network and identify nodes that may be best targeted therapeutically to ameliorate the effects of chronic inflammation in retrovirus-associated CNS disease.","Cytokine, RNA-binding protein, Tristetraprolin, microRNA, Human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder",

The method used allowed recording in stereotaxic conditions as well as behavioral observations. Recorded cells were localized on histological sections. Patterns of discharge were analyzed and their relationship to the state of vigilance, posture, and movements were examined. Phasic changes in neuron firing patterns were shown to have a clear-cut behavioral counterpart. During alertness, with or without movements, the thalamic cells displayed a sustained but irregular firing associated with a desynchronized EEG. During states of relaxation and immobility, the cells tended to fire in high frequency bursts associated with high amplitude slow waves on the EEG. This burst activity was present only in the absence of movement. In the ventral part of the ventrolateral nucleus most of the cells could be activated by various natural stimuli, particularly those which provoked a quick muscle stretch. In general, the firing frequency of the cells was much greater if the animal made a spontaneous movement than if the same movement was made passively. On the basis of the reported findings it is suggested that ventrolateral neurons play an important role in the general adjustment of posture preliminary to voluntary movement.",,

To learn how the MD-PFC thalamocortical network is engaged to mediate forms of cognitive control that are selectively disrupted in schizophrenia, we trained male monkeys to perform a variant of the AX continuous performance task, which reliably measures cognitive control deficits in patients (Henderson et al., 2012) and used linear multielectrode arrays to record neural activity in the MD and PFC simultaneously. We found that the two structures made clearly different contributions to distributed processing for cognitive control: MD neurons were specialized for decision-making and response selection, whereas prefrontal neurons were specialized to preferentially encode the environmental state on which the decision was based. In addition, we observed that functional coupling between MD and PFC was strongest when the decision as to which of the two responses in the task to execute was being made. These findings delineate unique contributions of MD and PFC to distributed processing for cognitive control and characterized neural dynamics in this network associated with normative cognitive control performance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive control is fundamental to healthy human executive functioning (Miller and Cohen, 2001) and deficits in patients with schizophrenia relate to decreased functional activation of the MD thalamus and the prefrontal cortex (Minzenberg et al., 2009), which are reciprocally linked (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Xiao et al., 2009). We carry out simultaneous neural recordings in the MD and PFC while monkeys perform a cognitive control task translated from patients with schizophrenia to relate thalamocortical dynamics to cognitive control performance. Our data suggest that state representation and decision-making computations for cognitive control are preferentially performed by PFC and MD, respectively. This suggests experiments to parse decision-making and state representation deficits in patients while providing novel computational targets for future therapies.","cognitive control, MD thalamus, neurophysiology, prefrontal, primate, schizophrenia",

It appears that the medial nucleus of the pulvinar sends projection fibres to the posterior cingulate gyrus (area 23), the retrosplenial area, and the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (areas TH and TF). The labeled terminals were concentrated in two bands, one in the deeper part of layer III and in layer IV, and the other in layer I. These projections were observed to be reciprocal, and the cortical afferent fibers to the medial pulvinar were found to originate from the deep layers of the cortex. The medial nucleus of the pulvinar was already known to be connected with the prefrontal cortex and with the inferior parietal lobule. Since this nucleus is now demonstrated to be connected with the posterior limbic neocortex, it is envisaged as being the thalamic counterpart of a cortical triad (prefrontal, parietal, and limbic) involved in modulating directed attention.",,

IV. Contrast and magno- parvo streams,"Macaque monkeys were shown achromatic gratings of various contrasts during 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) infusion in order to measure the contrast sensitivity of different subdivisions of primary visual cortex. DG uptake is essentially saturated at stimulus contrasts of 50% and above, although the saturation contrast varies with layer and with different criteria. Following visual stimulation with gratings of 8% contrast, stimulus-driven uptake was relatively high in striate layer 4Ca (which receives primary input from the magnocellular LGN layers), but was absent in layer 4Cb (which receives primary input from the parvocellular layers). In this same (magnocellular-specific) stimulation condition, striate layers 4B, 4Ca, and 6 showed strong stimulus-induced DG uptake, and layers 2, 3, 4A, and 5 showed only light or negligible uptake. By comparison to other cases that were shown stimuli of systematically higher contrast, and to a wide variety of DG cases shown very different stimuli, it is evident that information derived from the magnocellular and parvocellular layers in the LGN remains partially, or largely, segregated in its passage through striate cortex, and projects in a still somewhat segregated fashion to different extrastriate areas. The sum of all available evidence suggests that the magnocellular information projects strongly through striate layers 4Ca, 4B, and 6, with moderate input into the blobs in layers 2 + 3, and to blob-aligned portions of layer 4A. Parvocellular-dominated regions of striate cortex include both the blob and interblob portions of layers 2 + 3, 4A, 4Cb, and 5. Because the major striate input to V2 arrives from striate layers 2 + 3, and because the major striate input to MT originates in layer 4B and 6, it appears that area V2 receives information derived largely from the parvocellular LGN layers, and that area MT receives information derived mainly from the magnocellular layers.",,

This study shows the stability of the contours of the substantia nigra and its subdivisions in various species of macaques. The anteroposterior sequence of four subdivisions was standardized by defining eight verticotransverse levels, regularly interspaced and systematically used for each experimental case. Neurons of the substantia nigra sending axons to the striatum, thalamus and superior colliculus were identified by the technique of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. The nigrostriatal labeled neurons were essentially located in the ipsilateral pars compacta but also scattered dorsally in the pars mixta and ventrally in the pars reticulata. In addition, the existence of a crossed nigrostriatal pathway was demonstrated in monkeys. Nigrothalamic labeled neurons were found in the whole pars reticulata at rostral levels and only in the medial part at more caudal levels. Comparatively, nigrotectal labeled neurons were also found in the whole pars reticulata at rostral levels, but caudally, they were confined to the lateral part of the pars reticulata and the pars lateralis. It thus appears that these three nigral components may overlap at some levels of the substantia nigra. This is discussed in relation to the existence of branched axons already documented. However, the present results underline the strong tendency of the nigrotectal neurons to be segregated from the nigrothalamic ones and to be laterally located in monkeys. In addition, two nigrotectal components have been identified on the basis of their topography and their somata size: one with large somata located in the pars lateralis, probably specific to primates, and the other with smaller somata located in the pars reticulata. These two components may indicate the existence of two different functional systems.",CA; commissura anterior; CP; commissura posterior; HRP; horseradish peroxidase;,

We review a series of studies conducted mainly in our laboratory on macaque monkeys with unilateral V1 lesioning to reveal the neural pathways underlying visuomotor transformation and the cognitive capabilities retained in blindsight. After lesioning, it takes several weeks for the recovery of visually guided saccades toward the lesion-affected visual field. In addition to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the pathway from the superior colliculus to the pulvinar participates in visuomotor processing in blindsight. At the cortical level, bilateral lateral intraparietal regions become critically involved in the saccade control. These results suggest that the visual circuits experience drastic changes while the monkey acquires blindsight. In these animals, analysis based on signal detection theory adapted to behavior in the “Yes–No” task indicates reduced sensitivity to visual targets, suggesting that visual awareness is impaired. Saccades become less accurate, decisions become less deliberate, and some forms of bottom-up attention are impaired. However, a variety of cognitive functions are retained such as saliency detection during free viewing, top–down attention, short-term spatial memory, and associative learning. These observations indicate that blindsight is not a low-level sensory-motor response, but the residual visual inputs can access these cognitive capabilities. Based on these results we suggest that the macaque model of blindsight replicates type II blindsight patients who experience some “feeling” of objects, which guides cognitive capabilities that we naïvely think are not possible without phenomenal consciousness.",primary visual cortex lesion; superior colliculus; extrageniculate visual pathway; visual awareness; saccade;,

OABAergic terminals were identified directly by immunogold reactivity to a GABA antibody or by ultrastructural features. The results showed that in both of the main subdivisions of the geniculate the densities of immunogold particles over cortical and retinal terminals were about two- to three-fold higher than those over GABAergic terminals or glial profiles. In addition, cortical and retinal terminals showed higher positive correlations of glutamate immunogold particle densities to synaptic vesicle densities than did GABAergic terminals. These differences suggest higher and lower concentrations of glutamate corresponding to transmitter and metabolic pools of this amino acid in axon terminals of retinal and cortical origins versus GABAergic terminals, respectively, in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the macaque.",BSA; bovine serum albumin; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; LGN; dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus;,

III. Color,"Using spatially diffuse stimuli (or sinusoidal gratings of very low spatial frequency), levels of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by color-varying stimuli are much greater than those produced by luminance-varying stimuli in macaque striate cortex. Such a difference in DG results is consistent with previous psychophysical and electrophysiological results from man and monkey. In DG experiments with color-varying gratings of low and middle spatial frequencies, or with spatially diffuse color variations, DG uptake was highest in the cytochrome oxidase blobs, as was also seen with low-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. High-spatial-frequency, color-varying uptake patterns were shifted to cover both blob and interblob regions in a manner similar to that of the patterns obtained with middle-spatial- frequency luminance stimuli. However, in no instance did chromatic gratings produce uptake restricted to the interblob regions, as with the pattern seen with the highest-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. Thus, DG uptake is relatively higher in the interblob regions when comparing luminance with color-varying gratings that are otherwise similar. It was also possible to show DG evidence for receptive-field double-opponency in the upper-layer blobs, but color sensitivity in layer 4Cb appears single-opponent. The DG results suggest that color sensitivity is also high in the lower-layer (layers 5 + 6) blobs, and that many layer 5 receptive fields are double-opponent. Striate layers 4Ca and 4B-appeared color-insensitive in a wide variety of DG tests; this supports the idea of a color-insensitive stream running from the magnocellular LGN layers through striate layers 4Ca and 4B to extrastriate areas MT and V3. There was also a major effect due to wavelength: long and short wavelengths produced much more uptake than did middle wavelengths, even when all colors were equated for luminance and saturation. No variation with eccentricity was seen in cortical color sensitivity, at least between 0 degrees and 10 degrees.",,

Thresholds were tested monocularly before and after ibotenic acid was used to lesion parvocellular layers 4 and 6 of the contralateral geniculate. The injections were centered at the representation of 6 degrees in the temporal field on the horizontal meridian, and vision was tested with localized stimuli at this location. In addition, in one of the monkeys, a lesion was made in magnocellular layer 1 of the opposite geniculate, and the same thresholds were tested. Physiological and anatomical reconstructions demonstrated complete destruction of the target layers in 1 parvocellular lesions and in the magnocellular lesion, and sparing of the nontarget layers in the tested region. Parvocellular lesions caused a 3–4-fold reduction in visual acuity within the affected part of the visual field, while the magnocellular lesion did not affect acuity. Both luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity, tested with stationary gratings of 2 c/degree, were severely reduced by parvocellular lesions, but not affected by the magnocellular lesion. However, when luminance contrast sensitivity was tested with 1 c/degree gratings, counterphase modulated at 10 Hz, it was reduced by both parvocellular and magnocellular lesions. This study demonstrates that the parvocellular pathway dominates chromatic vision, acuity, and contrast detection at low temporal and high spatial frequencies, while the magnocellular pathway may mediate contrast detection at higher temporal and lower spatial frequencies.",,

I.

To examine MD's participation in cognitive functions, we analyzed the characteristics of task-related activities sampled homogeneously from the MD while two monkeys performed a spatial working memory task using oculomotor responses. Of 141 task-related MD neurons, 26, 53, and 84% exhibited cue-, delay-, and response-period activity, respectively. Most of cue- and response-period activities showed phasic excitation, and most of delay-period activity showed tonic sustained activation. Among neurons with response-period activity, 74% exhibited presaccadic activity. Most cue-period, delay-period, and presaccadic activities were directional, whereas most postsaccadic activity was omni-directional. A significant contralateral bias in the best directions was present in cue-period and presaccadic activity. However, such bias was not present in delay-period activity, although most neurons had a best direction toward the contralateral visual field. We compared these characteristics with those observed in DLPFC neurons. Response-period activity was more frequently observed in the MD (84%) than in the DLPFC (56%). The directional selectivity and bias of task-related activities and the ratios of pre- and postsaccadic activities were different between MD and DLPFC. These results indicate that the MD participates in higher cognitive functions such as spatial working memory. However, the manner in which these two structures participate in these processes differs, in that the MD participates more in motor control aspects compared with the DLPFC.",,

Single-unit recordings were obtained from the subthalamic nuclei of three monkeys trained to perform a series of visuooculomotor tasks. The monkeys were trained to fixate on a spot of light on the screen (fixation task). When the spot was turned off and a target spot came on, they were required to fixate on the target quickly by making a saccade. Visually guided saccades were elicited when the target came on without a time gap (saccade task). Memory-guided saccades were elicited by delivering a brief cue stimulus while the monkey was fixating; after a delay, the fixation spot was turned off and the monkey made a saccade to the remembered target (delayed saccade task). 2. Of 265 neurons tested, 95 showed spike activity that was related to some aspects of the visuooculomotor tasks, whereas 66 neurons responded to active or passive limb or body movements. The task-related activities were classified into the following categories: eye fixation-related, saccade-related, visual stimulus-related, target- and reward-related, and lever release-related. 3. Activity related to eye fixation (n = 22) consisted of a sustained spike discharge that occurred while the animal was fixating on a target light during the tasks. The activity increased after the animal started fixating on the target and abruptly ceased when the target went off. The activity was unrelated to eye position. It was not elicited during eye fixation outside the tasks. The activity decreased when the target spot was removed. 4. Activity related to saccades (n = 22) consisted of a phasic increase in spike frequency that was time locked with a saccade made during the tasks. The greatest increases occurred predominantly after saccade onset. This activity usually was unrelated to spontaneous saccades made outside the task. The changes in activity typically were optimal in one direction, generally toward the contralateral side. 5. Visual responses (n = 14) consisted of a phasic excitation in response to a visual probe stimulus or target. Response latencies usually were 70-120 ms. The receptive fields generally were centered in the contralateral hemifield, sometimes extending into the ipsilateral field. The receptive fields included the foveal region in seven neurons; most of these neurons responded best to parafoveal stimulation. Peripheral stimuli sometimes suppressed the activity of visually responsive neurons. 6. Activity related to target and reward (n = 29) consisted of sustained spike discharge that occurred only when the monkey could expect a reward by detecting the dimming of the light spot that he was fixating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

II. Activity Encoding Visual Versus Motor Signal,"We collected single-neuron activity from the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus, examined the information that was represented by task-related activity during performance of a spatial working memory task, and compared the present results with those obtained in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We used two oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) tasks. In the ordinary ODR task, monkeys were required to make a memory-guided saccade to the location where a visual cue had been presented 3 s previously, whereas in the rotatory ODR task, they were required to make a memory-guided saccade 90° clockwise from the cue direction. By comparing the best directions of the same task-related activity between the two tasks, we could determine whether this activity represented the cue location or the saccade direction. All cue-period activity represented the cue location. In contrast, 56% of delay-period activity represented the cue location and 41% represented the saccade direction. Almost all response-period activity represented the saccade direction. These results indicate that task-related MD activity represents either visual or motor information, suggesting that the MD participates in sensory-to-motor information processing. However, a greater proportion of delay- and response-period activities represented the saccade direction in the MD than in the DLPFC, indicating that more MD neurons participate in prospective information processing than DLPFC neurons. These results suggest that although functional interactions between the MD and DLPFC are crucial to cognitive functions such as working memory, there is a difference in how the MD and DLPFC participate in these functions.",,

In the present experiments, we studied the pathways which mediated these inputs by stimulating superficial radial (SR) and deep radial (DR) nerves and recording evoked potentials from the motor and sensory cortices and the following results were obtained: The focus for SR and DR evoked potentials in the sensory cortex was located in a circumscribed small area whereas in the motor cortex, the evoked potentials were distributed in a wide area along the central sulcus including the distal forelimb area. Ablation of the sensory cortex reduced the size, but neither abolished nor changed the latency of the evoked potentials in the motor cortex. Section of dorsal column nearly abolished the evoked potentials in the motor cortex, but only halved their size in the sensory cortex. Section of ventrolateral cervical column including the spinothalamic tract halved the size of evoked potentials in the sensory cortex, but did not change the size in the motor cortex. It is concluded that direct peripheral inputs to the motor cortex are mediated primarily through the dorsal column system whereas the peripheral inputs to the sensory cortex are mediated through both dorsal column and spinothalamic tract.",,

One was the dorsal column, which sends the input directly through the thalamus to the motor cortex, and the other was the sensory cortex, which transfers its input through association fibers. Removal of the sensory cortex produced very little motor disturbances and the function recovered within a week. Section of the dorsal column produced some motor deficit, but the deficit was not severe and the animals recovered nearly completely within 2 wk. Combination of dorsal column section and sensory cortex removal produced severe motor deficits. These consisted of loss of orientation within extrapersonal space and loss of dexterity of individual fingers. These deficits never recovered within the duration of observation, which lasted 4-5 wk. It is concluded that the direct sensory input from the thalamus plays an important role in the control of voluntary movements, but loss of its function can be compensated by the input from the sensory cortex. The possible neuronal basis for the observed motor deficits is discussed and it is proposed that the sensory input functions by selectively changing the excitability of cortical efferent zones before and during the execution of voluntary movements. Recovery of motor function following dorsal column section occurred in parallel with the recovery of sensory input to the motor cortex. The recovered function and sensory input disappeared again following section of the association fibers from the sensory cortex. Neuronal mechanism for this observation is also discussed.",,

Resulting degeneration was studied by silver impregnation methods. The nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) and the sublentiform nucleus (SL) project fibers to the nuclei of the posterior commissure (NPC) and to portions of the ipsilateral inferior pulvinar, pregeniculate nucleus and dorsal lateral geniculate body. NPC gives rise to the bulk of the fibers in the posterior commissure (PC) which largely terminate upon contralateral cells of NPC. Some fibers arising from NPC enter the ipsilateral central gray and terminate bilaterally primarily upon cells of the medial visceral columns of the oculomotor complex (OMC). These fibers partially decussate ventral to the aqueduct. Fibers from the olivary nucleus (ON) cross in the PC and project to terminations upon: (1) large cells of the opposite ON and (2) the anterior median nuclei and the contralateral lateral visceral cell column of OMC. NOT, and possibly ON, give rise to fibers crossing in PC that project to the contralateral accessory optic tract nucleus (AOTN). Unilateral lesions that fairly selectively destroy parts of NOT, ON, SL, NPC, central fibers of PC or the nucleus of the pretectal area (NPA), produce neither miosis, mydriasis, anisocoria, nor do they impair direct or consensual pupillary light reflexes. Unilateral lesions, which impair pupillary light reflexes, involve multiple structures, such as NPC, PC and lateral regions of the central gray.",,

I. A. study at the light microscopy level,"A study of the pregeniculate nucleus of the monkey (Macaca mulatta), in Klüver-Barrera-stained, and Golgi-impregnated material confirmed, with reservations, that the nucleus is bilaminar. The inner lamina extends anterior to posterior as a compact band of neuropil within the optic tract, passing from a dorsomedial position to occupy a more dorsolateral position with respect to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The neuropil of this lamina is formed from a plexus of very fine fibers, many having varicosities, which appear to make contact with dendrites. The outer lamina appears to be formed that part of the thalamic reticular nucleus that is apposed to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Three types of neurons were observed in the nucleus: Type I are found only in the inner lamina; they have small (12–14 μm) spheroid somata with thin dendrites having terminal arborizations formed by long protrusions and axons exhibiting varicosities. Type II neurons in contrast are found only in the outer lamina; their cell bodies are large (21 by 33 μm to 26 by 37 μm) and polygonal, contain much Nissl substance, and exhibit thick, relatively spine-free dendrites. Type III neurons, which are the most common, are found in both laminae; they have medium-sized 13 by 27 μm to 19 by 40 μm ellipsoid somata containing moderate amounts of Nissl substance and exhibiting well-developed spine-bearing dendrites. Since the axon of the type I neuron impregnates and is found only within the nucleus, this cell is considered to be an intrinsic neuron; on the other hand, types II and III are judged to be principal neurons, as their axons do not impregnate.",,

Ganzfeld flashes of white light were delivered under dark-adapted conditions to the surgically immobilized eye of the monkey while the other eye was observed in the infrared. Three-sec flashes elicited a consensual pupil reflex that was graded from −8 to 0 log Lamberts (L), indicating that the optic nerve fibers are capable of coding at least an 8 log-unit range of light intensity. In the physiological experiments, shorter flashes (0.1–0.5 sec) but otherwise identical conditions elicited monotonically graded responses from one type of LGN cell over the photopic range of −5 to 0 log L. Responses from other types of LGN cells were also graded over wide ranges but had different thresholds and, in some cases, nonmonotonic intensity-response functions. Latency of the excitatory LGN responses decreased with increasing intensity according to a power function with slope of −0.08. The pupil reflex and the LGN cell excitatory responses approximate power functions of light intensity with exponents of 0.22 and 0.14–0.29 respectively.

We examined the activity of thermally sensitive trigeminothalamic neurons and nonprojection neurons in the medullary dorsal horn (trigeminal nucleus caudalis) in three monkeys performing thermal and visual detection tasks. 2. An examination of neuronal stimulus-response functions, obtained during thermal-detection tasks in which noxious heat stimuli were applied to the face, indicated that wide-dynamic-range neurons (WDR, responsive to innocuous mechanical stimuli with greater responses to noxious mechanical stimuli) could be subclassified based on the slope values of linear regression lines. WDR1 neurons exhibited significantly greater sensitivity to noxious heat stimulation than WDR2 neurons or nociceptive-specific neurons (NS, responsive only to noxious stimuli). 3. In one behavioral task, the monkeys detected 1.0 degrees C increases in noxious heat from preceding noxious heat stimuli ranging from 44 to 48 degrees C. WDR1, WDR2, and NS neurons increased their discharge frequency as a function of the intensity of the first noxious heat temperature (T1) as well as the final temperature (T2). The responses of WDR1 neurons were greater than those produced by WDR2 or NS neurons across all the temperatures examined. The order of stimulus presentation affected the responses of WDR1 neurons to 1.0 degrees C increases in the noxious heat range but not those of WDR2 or NS neurons. 4. In a second behavioral task, the monkeys detected small increases in noxious heat (0.2-0.8 degrees C) from a first temperature of 46 degrees C. Although the responses of all three classes of neurons were monotonically related to stimulus intensity, WDR1 neurons exhibited greater sensitivity to small temperature increases than either WDR2 or NS neurons. 5. Subpopulations of all three classes of neurons exhibited responses that were independent of thermal stimulus parameters or sensory modality and that only occurred during the behavioral task. These task-related responses were time-locked to specific behavioral events associated with trial initiation and trial continuation. 6. These data provide evidence that a subpopulation of WDR neurons is the dorsal horn cell type most sensitive to small increases in noxious heat in the 45-49 degrees C temperature range and provides the most information about stimulus intensity. The findings support the view that nociceptive neurons have the capacity to precisely encode stimulus features in the noxious range and that WDR neurons are likely to participate in the monkeys' ability to perceive the intensity of such stimuli.",,

Although cortical representations of saliency have been reported, there is mounting evidence for a subcortical saliency mechanism, which pre-dates the evolution of neocortex. Here, we conduct a strong test of the saliency hypothesis by comparing the output of a well-established computational saliency model with the activation of neurons in the primate superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure associated with attention and gaze, while monkeys watched video of natural scenes. We find that the activity of SC superficial visual-layer neurons (SCs), specifically, is well-predicted by the model. This saliency representation is unlikely to be inherited from fronto-parietal cortices, which do not project to SCs, but may be computed in SCs and relayed to other areas via tectothalamic pathways.",,

Recent data suggest that there may exist in dystonia an increased thalamic drive to the mesial premotor cortex. To test this hypothesis, we induced overactivity of the motor thalamus by injecting a GABA-A (γ-aminobutyric acid) antagonist (bicuculline) into the rostral (pallidal) and caudal (cerebellar) ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus in both hemispheres of one monkey. Dystonic postures were observed in the contralateral limbs and axis. Electromyographic recordings revealed bursts of muscular activation with co-contractions during spontaneous dystonic movements and alterations in muscular patterns during sequential visually guided arm movements. The type of dystonia depended on the site of injections. Rostral thalamic injections induced more severe dystonic postures, whereas myoclonic jerks predominated following caudal injections. We conclude that these two distinct clinical patterns, which are frequently associated in humans, are probably due to a dysfunctioning of segregated thalamic projections to the supplementary motor area (from the rostral part) and to the primary motor cortex (from the caudal part).",,"Dystonia is defined as a syndrome of sustained involuntary muscle contractions, causing twisting movements or abnormal postures (Chan et al. 1991). It is almost always exacerbated by voluntary movements and can affect any part of the body. Although primary forms are suspected to be of genetic origin, their pathophysiology remains unclear. Electrophysiological and functional imaging data suggest that dystonia may result from a dysfunction of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops inducing an exaggerated spread of cortical activity (for review see Berardelli et al. 1998; Hallett 1998). Secondary dystonias provide support for this hypothesis because basal ganglia lesions, especially when they involve the putamen, induce dystonia (for review see Bathia & Marsden 1994). At present, few subhuman primate models of dystonia are available. Apart from the original models obtained by tegmentum lesions (Battista et al. 1976), most reports have been based on a model of levodopa-induced dystonia in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated monkeys (for review see Crossman & Brotchie 1998). Data obtained with this model are in favour of reduced internal pallidal inhibition leading to an increased thalamic drive of the mesial premotor cortex. However, the role of the motor thalamus in dystonia remains unclear. Secondary dystonia may result from thalamic lesions (Bathia & Marsden 1994; Lee & Marsden 1994), but paradoxically, thalamotomy is used in the treatment of dystonia (Cooper 1976; Tasker et al. 1988). The motor thalamus receives both basal ganglia and cerebellar inputs, and projects to motor and premotor cortices (Hoover & Strick 1999). Consequently, it is ideally suited to regulate inputs from the striato-pallidal and cerebellar areas to the motor and premotor cortices. Our hypothesis was that overactivity of the motor thalamus might induce a disorganization of premotor area activity, leading to dystonia. To mimic this phenomenon, we performed, in both hemispheres of one monkey, a series of GABA-A (γ-aminobutyric acid) antagonist (bicuculline) microinjections into the rostral or caudal parts of the ventrolateral thalamus nucleus. The results from this pilot study clearly show that injection of bicuculline into the motor thalamus induces dystonia, the type of which depends on the site of the injection."

It can be difficult to identify and delineate many of these nuclei and their finer subdivisions in conventional MRI due to their small size, buried location, and often subtle contrast compared to neighboring tissue. To address this problem, we applied a multi-modal approach in ex vivo non-human primate (NHP) brain that includes high-resolution mean apparent propagator (MAP)-MRI and five different histological stains imaged with high-resolution microscopy in the brain of the same subject. By registering these high-dimensional MRI data to high-resolution histology data, we can map the location, boundaries, subdivisions, and micro-architectural features of subcortical gray matter regions in the macaque monkey brain. At high spatial resolution, diffusion MRI in general, and MAP-MRI in particular, can distinguish a large number of deep brain structures, including the larger and smaller white matter fiber tracts as well as architectonic features within various nuclei. Correlation with histology from the same brain enables a thorough validation of the structures identified with MAP-MRI. Moreover, anatomical details that are evident in images of MAP-MRI parameters are not visible in conventional T1-weighted images. We also derived subcortical template “SC21” from segmented MRI slices in three-dimensions and registered this volume to a previously published anatomical template with cortical parcellation (Reveley et al., 2017; Saleem and Logothetis, 2012), thereby integrating the 3D segmentation of both cortical and subcortical regions into the same volume. This newly updated three-dimensional D99 digital brain atlas (V2.0) is intended for use as a reference standard for macaque neuroanatomical, functional, and connectional imaging studies, involving both cortical and subcortical targets. The SC21 and D99 digital templates are available as volumes and surfaces in standard NIFTI and GIFTI formats.","Subcortical, nuclei, DTI, MAP-MRI, fiber tracts, histology, D99/SC21, 3D digital atlas, macaque monkey",

A distinct projection of the precentral gyrus upon the paralamellar portion of the nucleus medialis dorsalis (MD) was observed. The somatotopic arrangement within this projection is less well defined than within the ventrolateral thalamic complex. The facial division of area 4 has not only a marked ipsilateral but in contrast to the body representation also a distinct if much weaker contralateral projection. No label was found in MD after injections in the postcentral gyrus. Thus, MD represents a thalamic link between agranular (motor) and granular (association) cortex of the frontal lobe.",,

Although neuroimaging studies have shown that higher stimulation frequencies in this target correlate with increased cortical metabolic activity, less is known about the cellular-level functional changes that occur in the primary motor cortex (M1) with thalamic stimulation and how these changes depend on the frequency of DBS. In this study, we used a preclinical animal model of DBS to collect single-unit spike recordings in M1 before, during, and after DBS targeting the cerebellar-receiving area of the motor thalamus (VPLo, nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis). The effects of VPLo-DBS on M1 spike rates, interspike interval entropy, and peristimulus phase-locking were compared across stimulus pulse train frequencies ranging from 10 to 130 Hz. Although VPLo-DBS modulated the spike rates of 20–50% of individual M1 cells in a frequency-dependent manner, the population-level average spike rate only weakly depended on stimulation frequency. In contrast, the population-level entropy measure showed a pronounced decrease with high-frequency stimulation, caused by a subpopulation of cells that exhibited strong phase-locking and general spike-pattern regularization. Contrarily, low-frequency stimulation induced an entropy increase (spike-pattern disordering) in a relatively large portion of the recorded population, which diminished with higher stimulation frequencies. These results also suggest that changes in phase-locking and spike-pattern entropy are not necessarily equivalent pattern phenomena, but rather that they should both be weighed when quantifying stimulation-induced spike-pattern changes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The network mechanisms of thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) are not well understood at the cellular level. This study investigated the neuronal firing rate and pattern changes in the motor cortex resulting from stimulation of the cerebellar-receiving area of the motor thalamus. We showed that there is a nonintuitive relationship between general entropy-based spike-pattern measures and phase-locked regularization to DBS.","DBS, frequency, mechanisms, motor cortex, thalamus",

To explore the role of calcyon in neurotransmission, we investigated its distribution in the neuropil of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR) and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), three brain regions implicated in these neuropsychiatric disorders. Calcyonimmunoreactivity revealed by immunoperoxidase technique, was localized in both pre- and postsynaptic structures including axons, spines and dendrites, as well as myelinated fibers and astroglial processes in all the three brain regions. The morphological diversity of immunopositive boutons suggest that in addition to glutamatergic, calcyon could regulate GABAergic as well as monoaminergic neurotransmission. Consistent with the role of calcyon in endocytosis, calcyon-immunoreactivity was rarely found at the synaptic membrane specializations proper, although it was present in distal compartments of neuronal processes establishing synapses. Given the widespread upregulation of calcyon in schizophrenic brain, these findings underscore a potential association with deficits in a range of neurotransmitter systems in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop.",,

Neurobiological studies of this behavior contribute to a better understanding of communication processes in general and of the cerebral prerequisits for the evolution of language and speech in particular. In the first part of the review the cerebral system which generates, selects and controls species-specific vocal behavior is described in anatomical and physiological terms. Its structures and functions are organized in a hierarchical manner whereby the pericingular cortex and the periaqueductal gray are nodal areas in the system. In the second part auditory decoding mechanisms of vocal signals are discussed in terms of cortical ablation studies and response characteristics of single neurons along the auditory pathway. There are marked differences in the processing of natural calls at the collicular, medial geniculate and cortical levels. The cortex makes a necessary contribution to the decoding of complex sounds. References to the problem of lateralization of auditory function in non-human primates are made. A keystone for the understanding of communication processes in general lies in the question of how the signal producing motor system and the signal receiving decoding system is centrally tied together. One way to investigate such processes is to compare single unit responses along the auditory pathway during an animal's own phonation and during the playback of that vocalization. The results provide evidence for an internal feed-forward mechanism during phonation which influences parts of the auditory system.",audio-vocal behavior; neural control; primate/man;,

The topographic distribution of the ‘parvocellular’ and ‘magnocellular’ segments is similar when samples are obtained from coronal, horizontal and sagittal series of sections. The parvocellular component occupies the rostral pole, the entire rostrocaudal extent of the medial tip and dorsomedial border, and probably also the caudal cap. The magnocellular segment is in the central core extending to the ventrolateral border except for the medial tip. These findings and their correlation with the results of other morphologic and physiologic studies allow the following conclusions. (1) The monkey subthalamic nucleus contains at least two differentially distributed cell subpopulations. (2) The magnocellular division is more related to the pallido-subthalamic-pallidal loop involving the lateral pallidal segment. (3) The parvocellular division appears strategically located to control the pallidal output to diencephalic and mesencephalic targets. (4) Cluster analysis can reveal the existence of more than one neuronal population in a particular brain structure where an overall unimodal distribution of cell sizes may suggest the presence of a single type.","Subthalamic nucleus,parvocellular; Subthalamic nucleus,magnocellular; Monkey; Basal ganglia system; Postnatal development; Cluster analysis;",

While 12 weeks following surgery a few isolated nerve cell nuclei could still be seen in the LG, by the end of the twenty-fifth postoperative week the nucleus was practically devoid of neurons.

It is therefore possible to make reliable comparisons of cell size between different animals. There is no change in size of cells in the parvocellular laminae between 8 days of age and adulthood, although cells in the magnocellular laminae grow a little.

Different areas of the cortex of 31 cats were injected with small amounts of horseradish peroxidase. All subregions of the hippocampal formation were screened for labeled cells. It was found that, with the exception of the entorhinal injections, only subicular areas of the hippocampal formation contain labeled neurons. When HRP was injected into the entorhinal cortex, labeled cells are also found in the hippocampus proper. The most dense projection from the subicular cortex is directed to the medial part of the cortical hemisphere. Here, cingulate, retrosplenial and medial prefrontal fields receive a substantial number of subicular efferents. Furthermore, the entorhinal cortex is reached by a number of axons originating in the subicular area. Scarce projections from the subicular cortex terminate in the dorsal prefrontal, temporal, parietal and prepiriform cortex. It is suggested that the projection from the subicular cortex to the neocortical areas of the frontal pole (medial prefrontal cortex) is of special importance as it may constitute a link between the association areas of the neocortex and those regions of the limbic system thought to play a role in memory (subicular cortex, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamus, cingulate gyrus).",HRP; horseradish peroxidase;,

Both monkeys received unilateral magnoceludar (M-) layer lesions 18 months before the study and one monkey received a parvocellular (P-) lesion during the study on the side opposite the magnocellular lesion. The lesions did not affect the accuracy of saccades to stationary or moving targets, but the latencies of saccades to targets in the M-layer lesioned hemifields were significantly longer. Neither M- nor P-layer lesions affected the earliest interval (0–50 msec) of pursuit initiation, but during later intervals (50–150 msec), eye acceleration was less for pursuit initiation in the lesioned hemifield compared to the control hemifield. M-layer lesions created larger deficits in ocular acceleration than P-layer lesions. All deficits, however, were relatively small and accurate pursuit speeds were achieved near the time of the initial “catch-up” saccade. If both M and P layers representing the same part of the visual field were destroyed, the monkey was unable to locate the target or initiate smooth pursuit eye movements. We conclude that smooth pursuit initiation receives contributions from both the M- and P-layers of the LGN and either of these inputs can support pursuit initiation.",Lateral geniculate Eye movements Pursuit initiationMonkeys;,

Nineteen were classified as wide dynamic range neurons and seven as high-threshold cells. Fifteen STT neurons were recorded in the deep dorsal horn (DDH) and 11 in superficial dorsal horn (SDH).

In lower thoracic segments, SDH neurons were antidromically activated from low-threshold points at the dorsal-ventral level of the denticulate ligament. Neurons in the DDH were activated from points located slightly ventral, within the ventral lateral funiculus. At higher segmental levels, axons from SDH neurons continued in a position dorsal to those of neurons in the DDH. However, axons from neurons in both areas of the gray matter were activated from points located in more ventral positions within the lateral funiculus.

Many lines of evidence suggest that signals relayed by the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) maintain their segregation in cortical processing. We have examined two response properties of units in the striate cortex of macaque monkeys, latency and transience, with the goal of assessing whether they might be used to infer specific geniculate contributions. Recordings were made from 298 isolated units and 1,129 multiunit sites in the striate cortex in four monkeys. Excitotoxin lesions that selectively affected one or the other LGN subdivision were made in three animals to demonstrate directly the magnocellular and parvocellular contributions. An additional 435 single units and 551 multiunit sites were recorded after the ablations. 2. Most units in striate cortex had visual response latencies in the range of 30-50 ms under the stimulus conditions used. The earliest neuronal responses in striate cortex differed appreciably between individuals. The shortest latency recorded in the four animals ranged from 20 to 31 ms. Comparable values were obtained from both single unit and multiunit sites. After lesions were made in the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN in two animals, the shortest response latencies were 7 and 10 ms later than before the ablations. A larger lesion in the parvocellular subdivision of another animal produced no such shift. Thus it appears that the first 7-10 ms of cortical activation can be attributed to activation relayed by the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. The units with the shortest latencies were all found in layers 4C or 6 and their responses were among the most transient in striate cortex. Furthermore, their responses all showed a pronounced periodicity at a frequency of 50-100 Hz. This periodicity was stimulus locked, and the responses of all short-latency units oscillated in phase. 4. An index of response transience was computed for the units recorded in striate cortex. The distribution of this index was unimodal and gave no suggestion of distinct contributions from the geniculate subdivisions. Magnocellular and the parvocellular lesions affected the overall transience of responses in striate cortex. The changes, however, were very small; extremely transient responses and extremely sustained responses survived both types of lesions. 5. A characteristic profile was observed in the response latencies in superficial layers. Latencies appeared to increase monotonically from layer 4 toward the surface of cortex, with the most superficial neurons not becoming active until 15 ms after responses were observed in layer 4C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

For 3–4 months, only a single electrode placement supporting ICSS was used in each animal. This established a stable behavioral response to brain stimulation at one brain locus. This procedure reduced the possibility that the response made to brain stimulation at one locus would be related to brain stimulation at a second locus. Lesions were made at these stable ICSS sites and orthograde degeneration from these sites was studied using the Fink-Heimer method. Mapping of ICSS loci indicated that the medial tip of the internal capsule supported very intense levels of self-stimulation. Lesions at ICSS sites produced degeneration which followed the inferior thalamic peduncle. Because of the position of this tract in the medial tip of the internal capsule, it was strongly implicated as one major pathway involved in self-stimulation. The stria medullaris and, to a lesser extent, the stria terminalis were also involved. The major interconnecting structures implicated by silver impregnation of terminal degeneration were the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex. An attempt was made to relate these findings to the medial forebrain bundle ICSS system in the rodent.",,

From 57 neurons 38 (67%) were activated with rotation to the ipsilateral side (type I) and 19 (33%) to the contralateral side (type II). The spontaneous activity was low (average 10.1 imp/sec) and irregular. No activity changes were found with eye movements. At 0.2–0.1 Hz neuronal activity showed a phase lead of 10–20 degrees relative to chair velocity. At the lowest frequency (0.01 Hz) the phase lead was only slightly higher (about 30 °). Accordingly the decrease in gain was only moderate. At lower frequencies the simultaneously recorded eye movements (nystagmus) showed an increase in phase lead comparable to the values for the neuronal activity in the thalamus. For both neuronal activity in the thalamus and nystagmus a time constant between 25–35 sec was calculated. The data are compared with vestibular nerve and nuclei recordings. It is argued that the time constants of vestibular neurons in the thalamus are very similar to the time constants of neurons in the vestibular nuclei in alert animals.,,

While the fundamental purpose of DBS is to modulate neural activity with electric fields, little is known about the actual voltage distribution generated in the brain by DBS electrodes and as a result it is difficult to accurately predict which brain areas are directly affected by the stimulation. The goal of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal characteristics of the voltage distribution generated by DBS electrodes. We experimentally recorded voltages around active DBS electrodes in either a saline bath or implanted in the brain of a non-human primate. Recordings were made during voltage-controlled and current-controlled stimulation. The experimental findings were compared to volume conductor electric field models of DBS parameterized to match the different experiments. Three factors directly affected the experimental and theoretical voltage measurements: 1) DBS electrode impedance, primarily dictated by a voltage drop at the electrode-electrolyte interface and the conductivity of the tissue medium, 2) capacitive modulation of the stimulus waveform, and 3) inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the tissue medium. While the voltage distribution does not directly predict the neural response to DBS, the results of this study do provide foundational building blocks for understanding the electrical parameters of DBS and characterizing its effects on the nervous system.","deep brain stimulation, voltage distribution, electrode, volume conductor, electric field, non-human primate, finite element, diffusion tensor",

A total of 113 trigeminothalamic neurons and over 200 presumed interneurons of nucleus caudalis (0-5 mm below the obex) and subjacent reticular formation were studied in rhesus monkeys anesthetized with chloralose or nitrous oxide. Each cell was characterized in terms of its antidromic responses to stimulation of ventral posterior medial and/or posterior thalamic nuclei and to three types of stimuli applied to its receptive field: a) graded 5-s temperature shifts at a rate of 9 degrees C/s from 35 degrees C to final temperatures of 20-52 degrees C, generated by a contact thermode; b) graded intensities of electrical stimulation to determine the conduction velocities of converging primary afferent fiber populations; and c) mechanical stimulation ranging from light touch to pinch with serrated forceps. 2. This analysis yielded five classes of units distinguished by the range of responses to mechanical stimuli and by the convergence of different primary afferent fiber populations. These five classes were found among both trigeminothalamic neurons and neurons which could not be antidromically activated. Class 1 units exhibited rapidly adapting responses to hair movement or light touch and received only A-beta primary afferent input. Class 2 units responded to light touch and pressure with maintained discharges and received A-beta primary afferent input. Class 3 units responded maximally to pinch with serrated forceps but also were activated by light touch and pressure. They received A-beta, A-delta, and C fiber input. Class 4 units responded to firm pressure and maximally to pinch with serrated forceps. These units had A-delta and sometimes C fiber input. Class 5 units responded only to pinch with serrated forceps and had exclusive A-delta fiber input. Some cells in all five classes responded antidromically to stimulation of the thalamus. Antidromic action-potential latencies of classes 1,2, and 3 units were shorter than those of classes 4 and 5 units (P less than 0.001). Receptive-field sizes were usually small (1-2 cm2) for classes 1, 2, 4, and 5 units, and larger for class 3 units (one to three trigeminal divisions). The marginal layer of nucleus caudalis contained mostly classes 4 and 5 units, some class 3 units, but no classes 1 or 2 units. The superficial portion of the magnocellular layer contained mostly classes 1 and 2 units, while neurons at the base of this layer contained class 3 units and some classes 4 and 5 units. Cells in the sujacent reticular formation included all 5 classes but showed a tendency to have large receptive fields (greater than 1 trigeminal division). 3. Neurons responding to noxious thermal stimuli (44-52 degrees C) were classes 3 or 4 units. The response patterns of classes 3 and 4 units to noxious thermal stimuli were similar. No classes 1 or 2 units and only one class 5 unit responded to increases in skin temperature. Thermal thresholds ranged from 38 to 50 degrees C and most heat-responsive units responded monotonically to temperatures between 45 and 52 degrees C...",,

Absence of transcallosal or circumventricular labelling, plus discrete and consistent retrograde labelling in other areas in the four cases, assured the validity and specificity of the observations. Numerous labelled cells in regions directly bordering striate cortex, however, were excluded from the analysis because of the possibility of uptake consequent to physical diffusion. With this exception, all labelled cells were counted at roughly 2-mm intervals for one case with extensive unilateral injection of HRP. Even excluding the closely circumstriate population, the totals indicate that more than 30% of the afferent input to striate cortex arises from nongeniculate sources. Four areas of neocortex together make up about one-fourth of the total afferents: superior temporal sulcus 17.1%;inferior occipital area, 6.1%; intraparietal sulcus, 0.4%;and parahippocampal gyrus, 0.3%. Other areas projecting to striate cortex include claustrum, pulvinar, nucleus paracen- tralis, raphe system, locus coeruleus, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Cells of the latter were particularly striking with their very heavy uptake of HRP, and, even in cases of minimal effective injection, were scattered throughout an extensive area from the posterior edge of the globus pallidus passing rostrally beyond the chiasm and into the nucleus of the diagonal band. On the basis of their distribution and known cholinergic affinity, it is argued that this group also includes the cells labelled in and around lateral hypothalamus and cerebral peduncle, and that as a whole the group constitutes a cholinergic counterpart of the diffusely projecting monoaminergic systems. It seems possible that the basalis projection at first follows a forni cal-subcallosal pathway to reach striate cortex via callosoperforant fibers.",,

Animals were studied when they were conscious and when they were anesthetized, during spontaneously occurring changes in behavior and during the presentation of visual, somesthetic, and auditory stimuli. Parallel low-gain and high-gain recorders allowed absolute temperatures to be determined with an accuracy of 0.05 C and temperature changes of 0.0004 C to be resolved. In confirmation of earlier studies, we found that in behaving animals, large changes in temperature occur in cerebral arterial blood and throughout the brain during feeding, sleeping, and arousal. Brain temperature shifts follow blood temperature shifts. The cerebral arterial blood at the circle of Willis is cooler than the brain. When sensory stimuli are presented, the usual thermal response is a rise in temperature at the cerebral arteries followed by a smaller rise in brain temperature. The changes in cerebral arterial blood temperature following sensory stimulation ranged from 0.003 C to 0.133 C in lightly anesthetized animals. The temperature changes in lateral geniculate, ventrobasal thalamus, or inferior colliculus ranged from 0 to 0.067 C and followed the blood temperature changes by 7 to 71 sec. Changes in brain temperature never occurred without a previous change in blood temperature. Blood temperature responses to sensory stimulation were larger in awake animals and in light anesthesia than in deeply anesthetized animals. Blood temperature rises were associated with peripheral cranial vasoconstriction, suggesting that the initial thermal response to sensory stimulation is peripheral autonomic activity and decreased peripheral heat loss. Other investigators observing brain temperature changes following sensory stimulation did not measure cerebral arterial blood temperature and concluded that the shifts in brain temperature were due to changes in neuronal metabolism or cerebral blood flow. The results of the present study do not support this conclusion. When cerebral arterial blood temperature and brain temperature are monitored simultaneously, it is evident that the changes in brain temperature elicited by sensory stimulation are produced by changes in temperature of the cerebral arterial blood.",,

Most of the neurons of lamina I respond only to noxious mechanical or thermal stimuli. Spinothalamic tract (STT) cells of lamina V tend to respond to both innocuous and noxious stimuli. Recent studies have suggested that the classical STT in the anterolateral quadrant (ALQ) contains primarily the axons of lamina V cells and that the axons of lamina I cells travel more dorsally in the dorsolateral quadrant (DLQ) to constitute the dorsal spinothalamic tract (DSTT). Using the anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected into the spinal cord in conjunction with a contralateral anterolateral cordotomy, we have found there is a substantial projection of the DSTT to the posterior nuclei of the caudal-ventral thalamus, designated Po/SG. This projection is almost entirely abolished when the lesion includes the area of spinal cord white matter at the level of the denticulate ligament. Larger lesions that destroy the ALQ and much of the lateral column white matter, but that spare the dorsolateral column white matter in the region of the corticospinal tract, abolish all transport of WGA-HRP to the thalamus. We conclude that the spinothalamic pathway in the non-human primate encompasses a continuous fiber bundle that extends dorsally to include the region of lateral column white matter opposite the denticulate ligament and that the more dorsal aspect of this pathway projects primarily to Po/SG of thalamus.",,

Three to 4 weeks prior to the acute experiment, the sciatic nerve was surgically exposed on one or both sides so that capsaicin or vehicle could be applied. Responses of STT cells recorded in 3 experimental groups were compared: untreated (21 cells), vehicle-treated (40 cells), and capsaicin-treated (83 cells). The background activity of cells in the vehicle- and capsaicin-treated groups was the same as in the untreated group (that is, cells on the side contralateral to surgery). Responses to innocuous (BRUSH) and noxious (PINCH) mechanical stimuli were unchanged by vehicle or by capsaicin treatment. However, responses to other noxious (PRESSURE and SQUEEZE) mechanical stimuli were significantly increased in the vehicle-treated group. Compared with a large reference population, all experimental groups showed a significant increase in overall responsiveness to mechanical stimuli (as determined by cluster analysis), greatest in the vehicle-treated group. Responses to noxious heat stimuli were significantly reduced in the capsaicin-treated group for 45°C and 47°C stimuli. Volleys in A fibers, probably Aδ fibers, evoked prolonged responses in many STT cells of all treatment groups. Electron microscopic counts of axons in the sciatic nerves of animals treated with capsaicin showed a reduced number of C fibers but no appreciable loss of myelinated axons. This loss of unmyelinated sensory fibers was presumably responsible for the reduction in the responses of the STT cells to noxious heat stimuli. Increased responses to some noxious mechanical stimuli and to A fiber volleys may have been the consequence of several factors, including surgical manipulation, a chemical action of vehicle and a contralateral action of capsaicin treatment.",,

The results support the model, postulated on the base of electrophysiological recordings in the retina of cat and mudpuppy, which consists of a linear centre and surround mechanism whose responses are modified in a frequency-selective multiplicative way by a nonlinear mechanism in the receptive field. This nonlinear mechanism is also held responsible for the second-order harmonic responses, which are the defining characteristic of Y-cells. The temporal and spatial characteristics of these mechanisms were determined. The responses obtained with the GWN stimulation and with modulated spatial sine wave gratings both indicate that the optimal temporal frequency of the linear mechanisms is near 7 Hz at 70 td and near 5 Hz for the nonlinear mechanism. The optimal spatial frequency for the linear mechanism is between 0.5–2 cycles/deg and between 6–12 cycles/deg for the nonlinear mechanism.",,

However, the responses of SNr neurons during saccades have not been examined with the same level of quantitative detail as the responses of neurons in other key saccadic areas. For this report, we examined the firing rates of 72 SNr neurons while awake-behaving primates correctly performed an average of 136 trials of a visually guided delayed saccade task. On each trial, the location of the visual target was chosen randomly from a grid spanning 40° of horizontal and vertical visual angle. We measured the firing rates of each neuron during five intervals on every trial: a baseline interval, a fixation interval, a visual interval, a movement interval, and a reward interval. We found four distinct classes of SNr neurons. Two classes of neurons had firing rates that decreased during delayed saccade trials. The firing rates ofdiscrete pausers decreased after the onset of a contralateral target and/or before the onset of a saccade that would align gaze with that target. The firing rates of universal pausers decreased after fixation on all trials and remained below baseline until the delivery of reinforcement. We also found two classes of SNr neurons with firing rates that increased during delayed saccade trials. The firing rates of bursters increased after the onset of a contralateral target and/or before the onset of a saccade aligning gaze with that target. The firing rates ofpause-bursters increased after the onset of a contralateral target but decreased after the illumination of an ipsilateral target. Our quantification of the response profiles of SNr neurons yielded three novel findings. First, we found that some SNr neurons generate saccade-related increases in activity. Second, we found that, for nearly all SNr neurons, the relationship between firing rate and horizontal and vertical saccade amplitude could be well described by a planar surface within the range of movements we sampled. Finally we found that for most SNr neurons, saccade-related modulations in activity were highly variable on a trial-by-trial basis.",,

Recording from neurons in magnocellular layers of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in macaque monkeys, we found that magnocellular neurons were unequivocally responsive to S cone-isolating stimuli. A quantitative analysis suggests that S cones provided about 10% of the input to these cells, on average, while L:M ratios were far more variable. S cone signals influenced responses with the same sign as L and M cone inputs (i.e., no color opponency). Magnocellular afferent recordings following inactivation of primary visual cortex demonstrated that S cone signals were feedforward in nature and did not arise from cortical feedback to LGN",,

In the neocortex, interneurons display 8B3 immunoreactivity in a rostrocaudal gradient, with a distinctive staining pattern that distinguishes known cytoarchitectonic and functional boundaries. The distribution pattern of 8B3 immunoreactivity in subcortical structures is very restricted. In the striatum, 8B3 stains spiny stellate neurons clearly defining a compartment that may correspond to the matrix. Gradients of immunoreactivity are detected in the putamen, globus pallidus, and deep cerebellar nuclei, where the most dense areas of 8B3 immunoreactivity corresponds to zones of polysynaptic projections to association prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the sensorimotor domains express lower levels of immunoreactivity. Only the projection neurons of the ventrolateral nucleus and the GABAergic neurons of the reticular nucleus express significant 8B3 immunoreactivity in the thalamus. In the spinal cord, 8B3 immunoreactivity is primarily associated with a subpopulation of motor neurons in the ventral horn and neurons in Clarke's nucleus. The complex distribution pattern reflects novel aspects of the functional organization of cortical and subcortical systems in the CNS of the primate brain and represents a potentially useful tool to assess subpopulations of neurons and brain areas as putative targets in human disease. J. Comp. Neurol. 430:369–388, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Structure–function relationships in the central nervous system (CNS) are based on the patterns of afferent and efferent connections. There is substantial evidence from protein distribution and gene expression analyses that distinct cell phenotypes and interconnected neurons express basic molecular features that relate to functional specialization (for reviews see Goodman et al., 1984; Levitt, 1985, 1994; Jessell, 1988; Hockfield, 1990; Hockfield et al., 1990; Goodman and Shatz, 1993; Bolz and Castellani, 1997). Unique molecular features in the adult brain often reflect differential expression of genes encoding proteins that are involved in neurotransmission, second messenger signaling, and perhaps even maintenance of connections (Pinkstaff et al., 1999; Rahman et al., 1999; for reviews see Houser et al., 1984; Parnavelas, 1990; De Felipe, 1993; Redies, 1997; Viollet and Doherty, 1997; Aplin et al., 1998; Ronn et al., 1998). In some instances, mature gene and protein expression denotes the remnants of patterns that arose during development of functional circuits (Hockfield and McKay, 1983; Hockfield et al., 1983, 1990; Levitt, 1984; Arimatsu et al., 1992, 1994; Pimenta et al., 1996; Reinoso et al., 1996). Discrete molecular expression can arise through a variety of biochemical mechanisms, including differential mRNA splicing (Leff et al., 1987; Tacke and Goridis, 1991; Black, 1992; Yeakley et al., 1993; Min et al., 1995; Wang and Grabowski, 1996; L. Zhang et al., 1996; Grabowski, 1998; Cote et al., 1999; Rahman et al., 1999), posttranslational modification of protein and lipids by glycosylation (Parekh et al., 1987; Warren, 1993), phosphorylation (Buxbaum et al., 1990, 1993; Boyne et al., 1995; Zisch et al., 1997; Greengard et al., 1998; Hiesberger et al., 1999; Howell et al., 1999), and proteolytic cleavage (Rauch et al., 1991; Meyer-Puttlitz et al., 1995; Perides et al., 1995; Porter et al., 1995; Yamada et al., 1995; Tanzi et al., 1996; Thinakaran et al., 1996). In situ hybridization can be used to investigate differential gene expression patterns in the CNS. At the protein level, antibodies directed against specific peptide, carbohydrate, or phosphate epitopes have been most useful. In particular, the generation of monoclonal antibodies facilitates the identification of unique features of proteins and lipids that are expressed among functionally distinct neurons and regions of the brain. Several monoclonal antibodies were generated previously that identify epitopes on neuronal subsets in the vertebrate CNS (Hawkes et al., 1982; McKay and Hockfield, 1982; Sternberger et al., 1982; Wood et al., 1982; Hockfield and McKay, 1983; Dodd et al., 1984; Kushner, 1984; Arimatsu et al., 1987; Naegele et al., 1988; Stephenson and Kushner, 1988; Celio and Blumcke, 1994; Ogawa et al., 1995). Novel membrane proteins and proteoglycans were discovered using this method (Hockfield and McKay, 1983; Levitt, 1984; Vielmetter et al., 1991; Lander et al., 1997). Proteoglycans are a family of proteins containing sulfated glycosaminoglycan moieties (for review see Ruoslahti, 1989). They comprise one of the major types of membrane and extracellular matrix proteins. Several proteoglycans are expressed in the CNS from early stages of development and are developmentally regulated with respect to their molecular size, concentration, carbohydrate composition, sulfation, and immunocytochemical localization (for reviews see Hockfield et al., 1990; Grumet et al., 1996; Lebaron, 1996; Margolis et al., 1996; Schwartz et al., 1996; Yamaguchi, 1996; Bovolenta and Fernaud-Espinosa, 2000). In particular, distinct carbohydrate composition can generate remarkable diversity, with the potential to produce multiple distinct forms on an identical protein backbone. Functionally, proteoglycans can bind cytokines and neurotrophins (Ruoslahti and Yamaguchi, 1991; Schlessinger et al., 1995) as well as cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules (for reviews see Margolis and Margolis, 1993, 1997). Thus, unique distribution patterns of proteoglycans may reflect specific functional roles among subsets of neurons. We used monoclonal antibody technology in combination with an immunosuppression method in an attempt to generate antibodies that would cross-react with unique subpopulations of cells in the motor system. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody, 8B3, which recognizes a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) on the somata and proximal dendrites of subpopulations of neurons in the CNS. The distribution patterns of 8B3-immunoreactive neurons reflect functional organization of cortical and subcortical systems in the CNS of Macaca nemestrina."

Recordings were made from the caudal part of the ventral posterior lateral (VPLc) nucleus of the thalamus in anesthetized macaque monkeys. In additon to many neurons that responded only to weak mechanical stimuli, scattered neurons were found that responded to both innocuous and noxious stimulation or just to noxious stimulation of the skin. A total of 73 such neurons were examined in 26 animals. 2. Noxious stimuli included strong mechanical stimuli (pressure, pinch, and squeezing with forceps) and graded noxious heat (from 35 degrees C adapting temperature to 43, 45, 47, and 50 degrees C). The responses of the VPLc neurons increased progressively with greater intensities of noxious stimulation. The stimulus-response function when noxious heat stimuli were used was a power function with an exponent greater than one. 3. Repetition of the noxious heat stimuli revealed sensitization of the responses of the thalamic neurons to such stimuli. The threshold for a response to noxious heat was lowered, and the responses to supra-threshold noxious heat stimuli were enhanced. 4. The responses of VPLc neurons to noxious heat stimuli adapted after reaching a peak discharge frequency. The rate of adaptation was slower for a stimulus of 50 degrees C than for one of 47 degrees C. 5. For the six neurons tested, responses to noxious heat were dependent on pathways ascending in the ventral part of the lateral funiculus contralateral to the receptive field (ipsilateral to the thalamic neuron). In two cases, the input to the thalamic neurons from axons of the dorsal column was also conveyed by way of a crossed pathway in the opposite ventral quadrant. In another case, access to the thalamic neuron by way of ascending dorsal column fibers was demonstrated. 6. The thalamic neurons had restricted contralateral receptive fields that were somatotopically organized. Neurons with receptive fields on the hindlimb were in the lateral part of the VPLc nucleus, whereas neurons with receptive fields on the forelimb were in medial VPLc. 7. Ninety percent of the VPLc neurons tested that responded to noxious stimuli could be activated antidromically by stimulation of the surface of SI sensory cortex. It was possible to confirm that many of these cells project to the SI sensory cortex by using microstimulation. Successful microstimulation points were either within the SI cortex or in the white matter just beneath the cortex. 8. We conclude that some neurons in the VPLc nucleus are capable of signaling noiceptive stimuli. The nociceptive information appears to reach these cells through the ventral part of the lateral funiculus on the side contralateral to the receptive field, presumably by way of the spinothalamic tract. The VPLc cells are somatotopically organized, and they are thalamocortical neurons that project to the VPLc nucleus and SI cortex play a role in nociception.",,

The vertical meridian passing through the fovea defines the border between these two populations of ganglion cells and has been demonstrated in four Macaque monkeys after unilateral injection of horseradish peroxidase into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and examination of the pattern of retrograde labeling of those ganglion cells projecting to the injected side. A median 1° vertical strip in which ipsi- and contralaterally projecting ganglion cells intermingle was found, confirming the report by Stone et al. ('73). In addition, occasional extrafoveal labeled ganglion cells were found as far as 2° from the vertical midline in the otherwise unlabeled hemiretinae. These ganglion cells were not numerous and had somata of all sizes, suggesting that they do not constitute a separate class of ganglion cells as found in the temporal retina of the cat. In contrast to the description by Stone et al. ('73), the strip of vertical overlap did not show a constant width through the fovea, since mixing of labeled and unlabeled ganglion cells was found in a band approximately 1/2° wide along both the nasal and temporal rims of the foveal pit which is 500 μm (2°) in diameter. Beyond these 1/2° arcs, the appropriate hemiretina was either completely unlabeled, or contained virtually every ganglion cell labeled on the side projecting to the injected dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The scattered labeled ganglion cells rimming an otherwise unlabeled hemifovea represent a possible anatomical basis for the phenomenon of “macular” or “foveal sparing” in which unilateral damage to the occipital cortex produces homonymous hemianopsia with sparing of a small island of centralmost vision extending about 1° from the foveal center. From this study, it is not possible to define the receptive fields or specific photoreceptor connections of the ganglion cells labeled with horseradish peroxidase, so that at the present time quantitative correlations cannot be made between the numbers of ganglion cells remaining on the affected side of the fovea and the extent of preservation of visual function in the spared zone. The presence of labeled ganglion cells rimming the fovea in its entirety is compatible with the sequence of foveal development in late prenatal life. After lateral displacement both nasally and temporally of ganglion cells which initially lay in the median vertical overlap strip of 1°, in the adult retina a strip approximately 1/2° wide around the perimeter of the foveola should contain a mixture of ipsi- and contralaterally projecting ganglion cells. The total population of ganglion cells beyond this 1/2° band should be completely ipsi- or contralateral in their projection patterns, as is observed. By this developmental sequence, widening of the 1° of vertical overlap to a total of 3° at the fovea is achieved, as was postulated by Morax in 1919.",,

Beyond their clinical implications, these results offer an unique view of the timing and sequence of cortical visual processing in the alert monkey, including the somewhat surprising findings of an extremely short-latency response in lamina IVA, a contra- over ipsilateral latency advantage throughout lamina IV, and the lack of a consistent flash-evoked response in the major cortical recipient of the magnocellular system, lamina IVCa. The present study used similar techniques to examine flash-evoked activity in LGN and in optic tract, both to elucidate the role of the subcortical pathways in establishing this pattern, and to provide a parallel, detailed view of the timing of visual activity in LGN and optic tract in the alert monkey. Flash-evoked responses are robust in both parvo- and magnocellular laminae, but these responses differ along several dimensions: (1) parvocellular multiunit activity (MUA) is
the amplitude of magnocellular MUA; (2) oscillatory activity is higher in frequency and shorter in duration in parvo- than in magnocellular responses; (3) inhibitory processes appear less prominent and diverse in parvo- than in magnocellular activity; (4) mean onset latencies of MUA are longer in parvo- than in magnocellular laminae, but there is extensive overlap in these distributions. Latencies encountered in ipsilateral lamina 3, and at laminar borders dorsal to 3, group more clearly with those of the magnocellular laminae than with those of the other parvocellular laminae. As a result, in the parvocellular division as a whole, the average latency to ipsilateral stimulation is shorter than that to contralateral stimulation. The optic tract exhibits a dorsal-to-ventral progression of onset latency and oscillation frequency consistent with a dorsal/ventral segragation of the inputs to parvo- and magnocellular layers. Comparison of optic tract and LGN data reveals that while many LGN response characteristics are initiated in the retina, significant modification of retinal output occurs at LGN. The techniques used here permit a particularly sensitive and reliable assessment of the timing and distribution of visual responses in the optic tract and LGN of alert monkeys. Our data support the view that in the alert monkey, the surface-VEP to passive, binocular flash primarily reflects activation of parvocellular thalamorecipient laminae of Area 17. Short-latency responses, in parvocellular lamina 3, and at laminar borders in the parvocellular division, may promote the early activation of striate lamina IVA. This in turn, may be important in shaping the laminar profile of activation in Area 17 as a whole. However, both the reported failure of binocular flash to activate magnocellular terminal zones, and the contra-/ipsilateral latency advantage appear to stem from processes operating at the cortical level.",Subcortical visual pathway; Visually evoked potential; Multiunit activity; Oscillatory potential; Alert monkey;,

Here, we address the question of how these mechanisms interact, starting with the observation that the peripheral pathways of the so-called “Core” and “Matrix” thalamocortical system provide the anatomical bases for tone and rhythm channels. We then examine the hypothesis that these specialized inputs integrate tonal content within rhythm context in auditory cortex using classical types of “driving” and “modulatory” mechanisms. This hypothesis provides a framework for deriving testable predictions about the early stages of music processing. Furthermore, because thalamocortical circuits are shared by speech and music processing, such a model provides concrete implications for how music experience contributes to the development of robust speech encoding mechanisms.","music, neuronal oscillations, thalamocortical projections, rhythm, auditory cortex",

These effects on operant escape and reflex responses to electrocutaneous stimulation (ES) were monitored for months to evaluate relationships between the extent of each lesion and the presence or absence of recovery from the early postoperative deficits. Before surgery, the animals were trained to perform an operant response that terminated ES to the lateral calf of either leg. The durations of ES tolerated by each monkey were inversely related to stimulus intensities within the pain sensitivity range of human subjects. The vigor of operant escape responses and the frequency of intertrial pulls of the manipulandum were directly related to stimulus intensity. Following anterolateral chordotomy at an upper thoracic level, these measures revealed a contralateral hypalgesia for each animal. Operant responsivity to stimulation contralateral to the lesion recovered to control levels for 7 animals (group R). Sustained contralateral recovery of operant reactivity was not observed for 8 monkeys (group U). Most of the lesions in groups R and U were similar in extent and location, involving the classical distribution of the spinothalamic tract (in the anterolateral and ventral columns). Thus, recovery was not determined solely by lesion configuration. However, when recovery did occur, it was associated with medially extensive lesions. A subgroup of 3 unrecovered animals received superficial lesions that did not substantially involve the gray matter or the ventral columns. For all animals, reflex magnitudes were initially diminished bilaterally and then increased over months of testing. Reflex recovery was greater for the animals that demonstrated recovery of intentional reactions to nociception (group R). An ipsilateral hyperreflexia became apparent for group R. Contralateral recovery to normal levels was observed for group R but not for group U. The time course of recovery for operant and reflex responses clearly differed, indicating that different processes determined changes in these spinal and supraspinal reactions to nociceptive stimulation.",,

Based on these observations, the neuropathogenesis and protein expression profiles in the thalamic tissues of EV71-infected animals were further analyzed in the present study. Changes in protein expression profiles following immunization with the inactivated EV71 vaccine followed by virus challenge were observed and evaluated, and their physiological roles in viral pathogenesis are discussed.

One aspect of this hypothesis was tested by determining the effects of ablations of these areas on the tactile threshold in monkeys. Thresholds were measured with a graduated series of nylon filaments bent against the palm. Repeated determinations were made until a consistent level of performance was achieved both before and after the cortical removals. Monkeys subjected to removal of the SI hand area contralateral to the tested palm showed only transient or no deficits; others with complete ablations of SI and SII either in the contralateral or in both hemispheres showed at most only slight residual losses. These results, indicating that the lemniscal projection areas are not necessary to sustain a high level of tactile sensitivity, are contrasted with the severe deficits in gross somatosensory discriminations that have recently been found to follow removal of the SI hand area.",,

Evoked potentials restricted to the magnocellular portion of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmc) of the thalamus were recorded after stimulation of the olfactory bulb (OB) and the posterior orbital cortex of the frontal lobe (OFC). Potentials evoked by stimulation of OB were probably trans-synaptically elicited, while potentials evoked by stimulation of OFC were probably a result of antidromic activation. 2. The area in which stimulation could elicit antidromic evoked potentials in MDmc was located in the centroposterior portion of OFC (CPOF). This area corresponds approximately to Walker's (80) area 13 and to von Bonin and Bailey's (9) area FF, and is situated medial and just anterior to a previously identified olfactory area, the lateroposterior portion of OFC (LPOF), which receives olfactory impulses through the hypothalamus. 3. Using extracellular microelectrodes, 58 neurons that responded with short latencies to OFC stimulation were identified in MDmc. To determine whether these neurons were activated antidromically by CPOF stimulation, three conventional neurophysiological criteria were applied; 20 of 58 neurons satisfied all the three criteria. Hence, they were concluded to be thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons. 4. Intracellular recording of MDmc neurons disclosed that CPOF stimulation elicits an antidromic spike potential accompanied by an afterhyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization was presumed to be due to concurrent stimulation of inhibitory orbitothalamic fibers. It was also shown that EPSP-like depolarizations with superimposed spike potentials often occurred in the middle of the afterhyperpolarization. 5. Intracellular recording of MDmc neurons strongly suggested that the remaining 38 neurons that did not satisfy one of the three criteria were also TCR neurons. 6. These studies provide electrophysiological evidence for a transthalamic olfactory pathway from OB through MDmc to CPOF. 7. Using an extracellular recording technique, responses of neurons to eight odors were examined in CPOF and MDmc of unanesthetized awake monkeys. When these results were compared with the responses of neurons to the same odors in OB, prepyriform-amygdaloid area, and LPOF, it was concluded that the newly found transthalamic olfactory pathway to CPOF is very different in function from the previously demonstrated transhypothalamic olfactory pathway to LPOF.",,

Most of the former responses were clear and excitatory, and most of the latter were weak and inhibitory. Excitatory responses were stronger for steady receptive field illumination which when turned on also yielded an excitation. No convincing dependence on the colour of the receptive field illumination was observed. The results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis of transmission of steady illumination via the shift-effect (“restoration”), and with respect to a hypothesis assigning a signalling function of low stimulus specificity to the ventral layers.",,

However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS (n ≥ 18 and P ≤ 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit (n ≥ 24 and P ≤ 10−4 in each region). These data suggest that the clinical effectiveness of HFS is correlated with, and potentially mediated by, a regularization of the pattern of neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia thalamic circuit.",,

Although cholecystokinin is very abundant in prefrontal cortex (Geola et al.:Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 53(2):270–275, 1981; Taquet et al.: Neuroscience 27(3):871–883, 1988), the organization of cholecystokinin-containing structures in primate prefrontal cortex has not been investigated. Using immunohistochemical and retrograde transport techniques, we characterized the cholecystokinin innervation of prefrontal cortex in macaque monkeys. The use of two antibodies directed against different portions of the cholecystokinin molecule revealed that distinct forms of the molecule were differentially localized in the same cortical neurons. These small, nonpyramidal cholecystokinin-positive neurons had a variety of somal morphologies and the density of labeled cells did not differ among cytoarchitectonic regions. Labeled neurons had a distinctive laminar distribution with the greatest density of cells present in layers II-superficial III. Labeled fibers also had a distinctive laminar pattern of distribution that differed from that of the immunoreactive neurons. In granular prefrontal cortex, terminal fields were evident in layers II, IV, and VI, with the greatest density in layer VI. Agranular area 24 exhibited a bilaminar pattern of immunoreactivity with a band in layer II and a very dense terminal field in layers V–VI. A high density of cholecystokinin-binding sites has been found in layers III–IV of prefrontal cortex and other association areas in the monkey; this finding has been attributed to possible cholecystokinin-containing afferents from the thalamus (Kritzer et al.: Journal of Comparative Neurology 263:418–435, 1987). The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is known to be a source of afferents which terminate in layer IV of prefrontal cortex. However, combined retrograde transport and immunohistochemical techniques failed to reveal the presence of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus that project to prefrontal cortex. These findings, and other observations, suggest that the terminal field in layer IV is formed by descending axons that arise from cholecystokinin-containing neurons in layers II and superficial III. This study demonstrates that the cholecystokinin innervation of prefrontal cortex has a laminar specific organization that is preserved across cytoarchitectonic regions. This distribution of immunoreactive structures suggests a distinctive role of cholecystokinin in cortical circuitry that is common to every region of prefrontal cortex.",,

Both electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques were employed to investigate this question. It was shown that neurons within the dentate and interposed nuclei were antidromically activated by stimuli applied to the cerebellar cortex. In addition, cells in these nuclei were retrogradely labelled following injections of small amounts of horseradish peroxidase in the cerebellar cortex. The injection of tritiated leucine in the deep nuclei resulted in the labelling of fibers projecting from these structures to the cerebellar cortex which appeared to terminate within the granular layer. Additional electrophysiological studies showed that neurons projecting to the cerebellar cortex could also be antidromically activated from the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, indicating that the nucleocortical projection in the primate arises at least in part as collaterals from neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei which also project to extracerebellar structures, as was shown in the cat.",,

Prior to drug administration, the minimal amount of electrical stimulation for eliciting AD, i.e., minimal AD's stimulation (MADS), was determined for each stimulation site and employed as a parameter for evaluating the effects of PCP on AD. Following PCP administration (0.5 mg/kg IM), marked increases (130 to 240% above the control level) in MADS of the HIPP, AMY and MRF were demonstrated, while only slight increase (+40%) in MADS of the CM was found. These results suggest that PCP causes a marked decrement in the ability of electrical stimulation to elicit AD in the HIPP, AMY and MRF, along with only little similar stimulation effects in the CM. This selective increase in MADS in structures of the limbic system and the midbrain reticular formation tends to implicate these systems rather than the thalamocortical system in the modulation of PCP's effects on central nervous system activities.",Phencyclidine; Rhesus monkey; EEG activities; Afterdischarges; Minimal-AD-stimulation; Limbic and reticular system; Thalamocortical system;,

The pulvinar works to generate salience by opposing functional mechanisms. First, it appears to suppress information, which is irrelevant. Second, it facilitates those visual data that arise in important behavioral contexts. Thus the net output of the pulvinar are signals, which would be useful for perceptual as well as effector systems. Within the anterior portion of the pulvinar, there are at least three functional regions. The first, termed the inferior map pulvina (PI), is contained entirely within the cytoarchitectural inferior pulvinar and forms a complete map of the contralateral visual field. This region receives projections from both the superior colliculus and visual cortex. The second area, labeled the lateral map (PL), is located in the cytoarchitectural lateral pulvinar adjacent to PI, contains another complete map of the visual field, and also receives collicular and visual cortical afferents. A third region, which is termed “Pdm” is also located within the cytoarchitecturally defined lateral pulvinar but has poor topography. It is interconnected with cortical areas 7, MT and PO.",,

In the present study, we demonstrate that the STN of the macaque monkey has dual sets of body part representations. Each of the two separate portions of the STN is characterized with somatotopically arranged direct cortical inputs that are derived from the primary motor cortex (MI) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). The first set of body part representations is transformed from the MI to the lateral STN, whereas the second set is transformed from the SMA to the medial STN. Intracortical microstimulation mapping was carried out to guide paired injections of anterograde tracers into somatotopically corresponding regions of the MI and the SMA. We found that direct inputs from the MI were allocated mostly within the lateral half of the STN, whereas those from the SMA were distributed predominantly within its medial half. Of particular interest was that the arrangement of somatotopical representations from the SMA to the medial STN was reversed against the ordering of those from the MI to the lateral STN; the orofacial, forelimb, and hindlimb parts were represented from medial to lateral within the medial STN, whereas these body parts were represented, in the inverse order, mediolaterally within the lateral STN. Moreover, inputs from homotopical MI and SMA regions were found to converge only partially into the STN. The present findings could account for somatotopically specific involuntary movements manifested in hemiballism that is caused by destruction of the STN.",,

This means that two weeks after reversal cells in both initially deprived and initially undeprived parvocellular laminae are approximately 15% larger than normal. However, long term survival shows that there is a second phase of change during which all parvocellular cells shrink, but particularly the initially undeprived cells which become considerably smaller than the initially deprived cells. Reopening the secondarily closed eye after a short period of reversal resulted in normal cell sizes in one animal, but two animals developed marked squints and had very small parvocellular cells in all laminae, and one animal developed bilateral amblyopia.

During the phase of dense hemiplegia, local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (lCMRGlc) is Decemberreased significantly in most of the thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the ablation, and there are slight contralateral Decemberreases. The lCMRGlc is reduced bilaterally in most of the brainstem nuclei and bilaterally in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but only in the contralateral cerebellar cortex. During the phase of partial motor recovery, lCMRGlc is incompletely restored in many of the thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the ablation and completely restored in the contralateral nuclei. In the brainstem and deep cerebellar nuclei, poor to moderate recovery occurs bilaterally. Moderate recovery occurs in the contralateral cerebellar cortex. The findings demonstrate that a unilateral cerebral cortical lesion strongly affects lCMRGlc in the thalamus ipsilaterally and in the cerebellar cortex contralaterally, but in the brainstem bilaterally. Partial recovery of lCMRGlc accompanies the progressive motor recovery. The structures affected include those with direct, and also those with indirect, connections to the areas ablated.",,

Single units in striate cortex were studied in alert macaques while they viewed a ganzfeld. Of the 385 well-isolated units studied for 10 min to 2 h, 24% gave ""luxotonic"" responses, i.e., their rate of discharge for 1 min or more in diffuse, featureless, wideangle illumination (20-450 cd/m2) was at least double that during a comparable period in darkness, or vice versa, and not attributable to eye movements of blinking. Those discharging faster in the light, ""photergic"" units, outnumber those responding to darkness, ""scotergic"" units 1 by 4:1. 2. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, on the other hand, among 46 units studied, 28% were luxotonic, but scotergic units were the more common. Both types were present in both magno- and parvocellular laminae. 3. For striate cortex two-thirds of the luxotonic units were binocular. Some showed highly similar response for either eye alone, and essentially no summation binocularly; others had grossly differing responses from each eye, and complex binocular interaction. 4. Many units of all types at striate cortex showed significant modulation of their activity consequent to saccadic eye movements made in darkness, whereas comparable modulation was not observed at the lateral geniculate nucleus. 5. On the basis of these and other findings it is concluded that luxotonic cortical activity is prominent probably only in alert primates, and that this is a consequence of the fact that all retinal ganglion cells in primates synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus (Ref. 9). Possible functions range from mere trophic input to providing a veridical image or a scaling factor for maintenance of perceptual constancy in the face of varying levels of general illumination.",,

One group was characterized by the expression of ER81 and the lack of Nurr1 mRNAs and mainly localized to layer 5. In monkeys, this neuronal group was further subdivided by 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression. The 5-HT2C+/ER81+ neurons were located in layer 5B in most cortical areas, but they intruded layer 6 in the primary visual area (V1). Another group of neurons, in monkey layer 6, was characterized by Nurr1 mRNA expression and was further subdivided as Nurr1+/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)− and Nurr1+/CTGF+ neurons in layers 6A and 6B, respectively. The Nurr1+/CTGF+ neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1+ neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1+/CTGF− neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles.",cerebral cortex; corticothalamic; cytoarchitecture; feedback; retrograde tracer; serotonin;,

Damage to the P pathway was produced by the oral administration of acrylamide monomer (Eskin and Merigan, 1986). Contrast sensitivity was measured in all subjects with isochromatic luminance gratings, as well as isoluminant chromatic gratings, modulated along several directions of a color space that represents color-opponent and luminance contrast (Krauskopf et al., 1986). The chromatic and achromatic sensitivity of the control monkeys was virtually identical to that of the human observer. Chromatic sensitivity of the P cell-deficient monkeys, measured at a low spatial frequency (0.3 c/deg), along a constant-blue color axis, was 0.9–1.5 log units lower than that of controls. Similar losses were seen along a tritanopic confusion axis and along 2 intermediate axes of color direction. Chromatic thresholds measured at higher spatial frequency (2.0 c/deg) were similarly reduced. Counterphase-modulated chromatic gratings were used to test color sensitivity over a range of temporal frequencies up to 15 Hz, and the loss of color vision was substantial over the entire range of frequencies. The luminance contrast sensitivity of the P cell-deficient monkeys for stationary gratings decreased after exposure by 0.5–0.8 log units. These results indicate that the chromatic and achromatic spatial vision of macaques is very similar to that of humans. They also suggest that the P pathway plays an important role in macaque chromatic sensitivity at all spatial frequencies, as well as achromatic sensitivity at high spatial and lower temporal frequencies.",,

The resections were staged such that the older was suitable for evaluation of retrograde cell change and myelin tract degeneration (cresyl violet and Loyez stain) and the more recent for anterograde fiber degeneration (Nauta). From the cresyl violet-Loyez stained hemispheres evidence was obtained for sustaining fiber projections to the insula from n. ventralis caudalis parvocellularis. Nauta stains demonstrated projections from the insular cortex to n. ventralis caudalis, n. ventralis caudalis ventralis and n. ventralis caudalis parvocellularis. Connections were also demonstrated to n. centralis, n. parafascicularis, n. dorsalis oralis and the intralaminar nucleus.

The principal features of the transneuronal changes are vacuolation of the perikaryon, chromatolysis, reduction and alterations of mitochondria, nuclear infoldings, proliferation of neurotubules, overall reduction in the cell size, paucity of the dendritic arborization, postsynaptic watery dendrites and profiles with tubulo-vesicular structures. Dark transformation with preservation of filaments was also reported to precede the process of phagocytosis of the filamentous degenerating optic nerve terminals. Other findings related to enucleation were disappearance of axon terminals of other than optic origin, presence of boutons with crowded synaptic vesicles, and glial reaction. ‘Seepage’ of altered substances from the degenerating optic nerve terminals to the postsynaptic site and the multiple mini-traumata induced to the postsynaptic neuron during the phagocytosis of optic nerve terminals engulfed together with fragments of postsynaptic cytoplasm, are considered possible pathogenetic mechanisms of transneuronal degeneration. A chain reaction of transneuronal degeneration may be responsible for the severe reduction of the dendritic arborization.",,

The responses of off-center cells lag the stimulus more than do those of on-center cells.

The synaptic relationship between thalamic projection neurons and the opioid peptide enkephalin (ENK) was examined at the light (LM) and ultrastructural (EM) level using the combined techniques of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase and ENK immunocytochemistry. Utilizing two different chromogens to develop the peroxidase reaction product, the two labeled neural elements could be readily distinguished at the LM level in the same tissue section. In the medullary, cervical, and lumbar levels of the dorsal horn of both the cat and monkey, at least 30% of the thalamic projection neurons in lamina I were observed at the LM level to be contacted by ENK-immunoreactive varicosities. In lamina V, approximately 50% of the thalamic projection neurons received ENK contacts. Since some neurons were not observed to receive a dense ENK innervation on their somata and proximal dendrites, these data suggest that there may be different functional types of thalamic projection neurons. At the EM level, the ENK-immunoreactive varicosities were observed to form asymmetrical synaptic contacts on the labeled somata and proximal dendrites of the projection neurons. In all cases, the ENK varicosities were morphologically similar and contained round or oval agranular vesicles and a few dense-core vesicles. These observations suggest that ENK acts to a substantial degree on postsynaptic opiate receptors located on thalamic projection neurons.",,

Most of the numerous isoforms of TRIM19 localize in nuclear domains known as PML nuclear bodies or oncogenic domains (PODs), which also contain proteins involved in processes including transcription and chromatin modification. TRIM19 has been reported to exit the nucleus within minutes or hours of retroviral infection of the cell,1 but others have not observed this translocation.2 The potential importance of TRIM19 as an interferon-stimulated host restriction factor and the conflicting data on PML cellular translocation following infection prompted us to study this protein in our rapid SIV/macaque model of HIV neurologic disease.3 Using immunohistochemical techniques to stain thalamic thin sections, we observed a striking and coordinated modulation of TRIM19 bodies in response to SIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Following infection, significantly more PODs per nucleus were found in astrocytes, the most abundant cell of the CNS (unpublished data). Astrocytes are susceptible to infection but are usually not productively infected. The upregulation of TRIM19 was observed during acute infection and development of encephalitis, when virus is most abundant, tracing a course similar to what we have described previously for the cytokine response.4 In Fig. 1, astrocytes include several of the cells near or at the cuff with high, blown-out levels of TRIM19 (green, as labeled with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-PML antibody kindly provided by Gary Hayward). TRIM19-positive and TRIM19-negative cells in and around a perivascular cuff of CD68-positive macrophages. Numerous CD68+ cells (red) surround a blood vessel (black) in the thalamus of a simian immunodeficiency virus-infected pigtailed macaque. Nuclei, stained with DAPI, are blue. In several CD68+ cells, no TRIM19 staining (green, punctate nuclear dots) is apparent. POD number, size, and intensity differ between the CD68+ cells and surrounding cells, including astrocytes. Interestingly, similar fluctuations were not observed in macrophages in the brain. Myeloid lineage cells that enter the brain from the periphery are an important source of virus in the CNS and are responsible for retroviral entry within days of infection. Macrophages contribute to pathogenesis both by hosting viral replication and by shaping a damaging inflammatory milieu. Perivascular cuffs of infiltrating macrophages are a hallmark of progression to CNS disease. In our assays, TRIM19 was not detected in some infiltrating CD68+ macrophages (labeled red). Although astrocytes displayed TRIM19 responses consistent with interferon (IFN)-mediated upregulation, macrophages did not. Some infected macrophages contained few or no visible PODs. Based upon these results, it is tempting to speculate that low levels or the absence of TRIM19 nuclear bodies may contribute to a permissive environment for lentiviral replication in perivascular macrophages, while high levels of TRIM19 help to restrict replication in astrocytes. However, a causal relationship is not demonstrated by these observations, and our unpublished work with in vitro models—with all the caveats these must bear—has admittedly not supported a major role for TRIM19 in retroviral restriction. Indeed, perhaps the most striking message of the illustration is that cells only tens of microns distant from each other display such different responses to similar inflammatory signals.",,

The idea of the “leaky” relay cell is reconsidered in the present analysis of prepotential firing and LGN responses of color-opponent cells of the macaque LGN to stimuli varying in size, relative luminance, and spectral distribution. Above a threshold prepotential spike frequency, called the signal transfer threshold (STT), there is a range of more than 2 log units of test field luminance that has a 1:1 relationship between prepotential- and LGN-cell firing rates. Consequently, above this threshold, the LGN cell response can be viewed as an extension of prepotential firing (a “nonleaky relay cell”). The STT level decreased when the size of the stimulus increased beyond the classical receptive field center, indicating that the LGN cell is influenced by factors other than the prepotential input. For opponent ON cells, both the excitatory and the inhibitory response decreased similarly when the test field size increased beyond the center of the receptive field. These findings have consequences for the modeling of LGN cell responses and transmission of visual information, particularly for small fields. For instance, for LGN ON cells, information in the prepotential intensity–response curve for firing rates below the STT is left to be discriminated by OFF cells. Consequently, for a given light adaptation, the STT improves the separation of the response range of retinal ganglion cells into “complementary” ON and OFF pathways.",Vision; Prepotentials; S-potentials; LGN PC-cells; Information transfer;,

Nineteen vervet monkeys were scanned in a cross-sectional design, which consisted of three age groups (birth to 59 d, 60–179 d, 180 d to adult) that captured the developmental period of greatest synaptic density within the second group. Two rhesus and two vervet monkeys were also examined longitudinally. Subjects were sedated throughout the procedure with a combination of ketamine and midazolam. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of 20 brain regions indicated lowest LCMRglc in rhesus and vervet monkeys <2 months of age (about 60% of adult levels). These metabolic rates more than doubled to approximately 155% of adult levels after the second postnatal month, coincident with transient synaptic overproduction and increased sociobehavioral activity. LCMRglc remained high until 6 months postnatally, coincident with continued dendritic growth and the emerging sociobehavioral independence of the young monkey. After 6 months, LCMRglc decreased gradually to adult levels. Thus, the period between 2 and 6 months is a time of peak metabolic activity, which coincides with increased histologic and behavioral activity in the developing monkey.",,

Monkeys having unilateral or bilateral implants on inferotemporal cortex, and control animals, were trained to make four visual discriminations. Postoperative training in the animals with implants was started only when electrical abnormalities were recorded in the EEG from both hemispheres. It was found that the animals with bilateral implants, but not those with unilateral implants, were impaired on two tasks. On the assumption of equivalent degrees of electrical abnormality in animals with unilateral and bilateral implants, it seems probable that the impairment in the animals with bilateral implants is related to their bilateral tissue destruction.",,

Such a discontinuity has been found in a variety of mammalian species, including carnivores, primates, a rodent and a marsupial. Electrophysiological evidence obtained from some of these species shows that the discontinuity corresponds to the blind spot. It is concluded that the representation of the retina within the lateral geniculate nucleus is extremely accurate, since the retinal receptor layer and the geniculate layers have corresponding holes. Two possible mechanisms that would demand such a discontinuity are considered. One is an intralaminar mechanism in which the cells in each lamina accurately reflect the distribution of retinal receptors; the other is an interlaminar mechanism in which the representations of the homonymous hemiretinae are so accurately aligned that the optic disc must be represented by a cellular discontinuity.",,

This region of cortex contains a core of primary-like areas surrounded by a narrow belt of associated fields. Adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region which contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In previous studies we defined the parabelt region as cortex with topographic cortical connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, and connections with the dorsal and magnocellular divisions of the medial geniculate complex, but minimal connections with the core region and ventral division of the medial geniculate complex. The callosal connections of the parabelt auditory cortex were determined by placing injections, of up to six distinguishable tracers, into different locations of the parabelt region in each of four macaque monkeys. The results indicated that the strongest callosal projections arise from homotopic areas in parabelt cortex, and they roughly matched the rostrocaudal levels of the medial and lateral belt cortex. Weaker callosal inputs to the parabelt originate from the corresponding levels of the superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. The core region does not contribute significant callosal projections to the parabelt region. The results provide further support for the conclusion that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing beyond direct activation by primary subcortical and cortical auditory structures.",,"An emerging theory of auditory cortical organization in primates suggests that the dorsal superior temporal gyrus (STG) contains three interconnected, but functionally distinct auditory regions (Fig. 1). A primary-like ‘core’ region, comprised of three subdivisions, is surrounded by a narrow ‘belt’ of cortex containing as many as eight subdivisions. A lateral ‘parabelt’ region, comprised of at least two subdivisions, occupies the cortex adjacent to the lateral belt. The centrally located core receives strong inputs from the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex (MGv) and projects topographically to areas in the surrounding belt cortex. In addition to the MGv and core, the belt region also receives strong inputs from the magnocellular (MGm) and dorsal (MGd) divisions of the medial geniculate complex, and suprageniculate and limitans nuclei. The parabelt receives dense topographic projections from the MGm, MGd, suprageniculate and limitans nuclei, and belt cortex, but no substantial inputs from the MGv or core (Hackett et al. 1998a,b). Thus, auditory cortical processing has serial and parallel components involving three major stages (see also Kaas & Hackett 1998). The superior temporal region of the macaque monkey. (A) Lateral view of the right hemisphere showing the approximate location of the parabelt cortex on the superior temporal gyrus; (B) Dorsolateral view of the same hemisphere as in A, but with the parietal cortex overlying the superior temporal plane removed. The locations of the core (solid lines), lateral belt (inner dashed lines) and parabelt cortex (outer dashed lines) are visible. The medial belt and rostromedial part of the core region in the circular sulcus are not visible. (C) Proposed subdivisions of the macaque auditory cortex on a graphically unfolded view of the right superior temporal region. The abbreviations are as in the list of abbreviations. See Hackett et al. (1998a) for the relationship between our proposed subdivisions and those of other authors. In the present report we extend these observations to include the callosal connections of the parabelt region. So far, nearly all of the studies concerning interhemispheric connections of the auditory cortex in primates have focused on the primary, or core, auditory cortex (Pandya & Sanides 1973;Fitzpatrick & Imig 1980;Aitkin et al. 1988;Luethke et al. 1989;Morel & Kaas 1992;Morel et al. 1993;Pandya & Rosene 1993). Only two studies have examined the interhemispheric connections of the nonprimary auditory cortex in primates (Pandya et al. 1969;Cipolloni & Pandya 1989). Similarly, in cats, where the literature in auditory cortex is more abundant, most investigations of interhemispheric connections have concentrated on the primary auditory areas (e.g. Imig & Adrian 1977;Imig & Brugge 1978;Imig & Reale 1980, 1981;Middlebrooks et al. 1980;Middlebrooks & Zook 1983;Brugge & Reale 1985;Code & Winer 1986). The callosal connections of nonprimary regions in cats have received much less attention (Imig & Reale 1980;Rouiller et al. 1991). The data from cats and primates indicate that the callosal connections of the primary auditory cortex are predominately homotopic (i.e. topographically and tonotopically matched), with relatively minor contributions from other areas of the surrounding cortex. The interhemispheric connections of the nonprimary areas of the auditory cortex have not been studied in sufficient detail to determine what connectional patterns exist, and if they resemble those of the primary auditory cortex. Thus, one purpose of the present study was to determine the pattern of interhemispheric inputs to the parabelt auditory region of the STG in macaques using simultaneous multiple tracers. Another important purpose of this study was to determine if the pattern of callosal connections of parabelt cortex is consistent with the concept of distinct core, belt and parabelt regions of auditory processing (Hackett et al. 1998a,b)."

These two sub-populations are in temporal quadrature, the fast biphasic cells crossing over from one response phase to the reverse just as the slow monophasic cells reach their peak response. The two sub-populations also differ in the spatial phases of their RFs. A principal components analysis of the spatio-temporal RFs of directional V1 cells shows that their RFs could be constructed by a linear combination of two components, one of which has the temporal and spatial characteristics of a fast biphasic cell, and the other the temporal and spatial characteristics of a slow monophasic cell. Magnocellular LGN cells are fast and biphasic and lead the fast-biphasic V1 subpopulation by 7 ms; parvocellular LGN cells are slow and largely monophasic and lead the slow monophasic V1 sub-population by 12 ms. We suggest that directional V1 cells get inputs in the approximate temporal and spatial quadrature required for motion detection by combining signals from the two non-directional cortical sub-populations which have been identified, and that these sub-populations have their origins in magno and parvo LGN cells, respectively.",Motion mechanisms; Directional cells; Parvo cells; Magno cells; Quadrature;,

Although anterior inferotemporal damage was found to have only negligible effect, both total inferotemporal and posterior inferotemporal lesions yielded markedly elevated limens for reduced pattern stimuli but not for reduced colour stimuli. The impaired animals could be trained to discriminate reduced patterns that were below their original discrimination limen, but this required many more trials than were needed for postoperative relearning of the initial pair; normal animals, by contrast, showed perfect transfer from the standard to the smallest pair. The findings suggest that the incereased threshold for reduced patterns in monkeys with inferotemporal lesion is attributable not to a visual acuity disorder but to an impairment of pattern perception resulting mainly from damage to posterior inferotemporal cortex.",,

Three major neurochemical subdivisions of the dorsal pulvinar were identified by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, as well as immunostaining for calbindin-D28K and parvalbumin. The dorsal lateral pulvinar nucleus (PLd) was defined on histochemical criteria as a distinct AChE- and parvalbumin-dense, calbindin-poor wedge that was found to continue caudally along the dorsolateral edge of the pulvinar to within 1 mm of its caudal pole. The ventromedial border of neurochemical PLd with the rest of the dorsal pulvinar, termed the medial pulvinar (PM), was sharply defined. Overall, PM was lighter than PLd for AChE and parvalbumin and displayed lateral (PMl) and medial (PMm) histochemical divisions. PMm contained a central “oval” (PMm-c) that stained darker for AChE and parvalbumin than the surrounding region. The neurochemically defined PLd was labeled by tracer injections in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Label within PMl was found after prefrontal and IPL and, to a lesser extent, after STG injections. The PMm was labeled after injections of the IPL and STG, but only sparsely following prefrontal injections. The histochemically distinct subregion or module of PMm, PMm-c, was labeled only by STG injections. Overlapping labeling was found in dorsal pulvinar divisions PMl and PLd following paired IPL/prefrontal, but not IPL/STG or these particular STG/prefrontal, injections. Thus, PLd may be a visuospatially related region whereas PM appears to contain several types of territories, some related to visual or auditory inputs, and others that receive directly converging input from posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex and may participate in a distributed cortical network concerned with visuospatial functions. J. Comp. Neurol. 419:61–86, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Excluding the anterior nucleus, which might be considered a component of the somatosensory system (Pons and Kaas, 1985; Cusick and Gould, 1990; Krubitzer and Kaas, 1992; Rausell et al., 1992), the pulvinar of monkeys can be divided into two broad zones: the inferior pulvinar (PI) complex (Gutierrez et al., 1995; Gray et al., 1999) and the “dorsal pulvinar.” The PI complex contains several chemoarchitectonic and retinotopically organized subdivisions(Lin and Kaas, 1979; Bender, 1981; Ungerleider et al., 1983, 1984; Cusick et al., 1993; Gutierrez et al., 1995; Gutierrez and Cusick, 1997; Stepniewska and Kaas, 1997; Gray et al., 1999) and clearly relates to the modality of vision. The organization of the dorsal pulvinar complex, by contrast, is less well understood, due in part to a lack of demonstrated sensory topography. Traditionally, the dorsal pulvinar has been divided into lateral (PL) and medial (PM) pulvinar nuclei caudally, with the lateral posterior (LP) nucleus situated rostral to these zones (Olszewski, 1952; Jones, 1985). Based on its connections with the caudal inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and dorsal prelunate cortex (Baleydier and Mauguière, 1977; Divac et al., 1977; Mesulam et al., 1977; Rezak and Benevento, 1979; Weber and Yin, 1984; Asanuma et al., 1985; Schmahmann and Pandya, 1990; Hardy and Lynch, 1992; Baleydier and Morel, 1992; Baizer et al., 1993; Yeterian and Pandya, 1997), the dorsal part of classical PL appears to be predominantly concerned with vision. Whereas the adjacent portions of classical LP also connect with the caudal inferior parietal lobule (Baleydier and Mauguière, 1977; Mesulam et al., 1977; Asanuma et al., 1985; Baleydier and Morel, 1992), major connections of LP are with somatosensory-related area 5 (Jones et al., 1979; Pons and Kaas, 1985; Yeterian and Pandya, 1985; Acuña et al., 1990). The cortical connections of PM are more widespread. PM connects not only with certain extrastriate visual areas including V4 and inferotemporal and posterior parietal cortex (e.g., Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1988; Baleydier and Morel, 1992; Hardy and Lynch, 1992; Baizer et al., 1993; Rockland, 1996; Yeterian and Pandya, 1997), but also with auditory and somatosensory cortical areas (Burton and Jones, 1976; Friedman and Murray, 1986; Acuña et al., 1990; Pandya, 1995; Hackett et al., 1998). Moreover, PM interconnects with non-modality-specific higher order cortex in addition to “paralimbic” association areas, including insular, superior temporal polysensory (STP), temporopolar, dorsal prearcuate, orbitofrontal, parahippocampal, and cingulate cortex as well as the amygdala (Trojanowski and Jacobson, 1974, 1976; Bos and Benevento, 1975; Burton and Jones, 1976; Jones and Burton, 1976; Baleydier and Mauguière, 1977, 1985; Kievit and Kuypers, 1977; Mufson and Mesulam, 1984; Markowitsch et al., 1985; Friedman and Murray, 1986; Huerta et al, 1986; Moran et al., 1987; Stanton et al., 1988; Yeterian and Pandya, 1989, 1991; Barbas et al., 1991; Morecraft et al., 1992; Romanski et al., 1997). The diversity of its connections suggests that the dorsal pulvinar plays multiple roles in behavior, but its functions are poorly understood. This may be because the boundaries and basic units of organization of this heterogeneous region have not been clearly defined. A case in point is the large nucleus PM. A small ventrocaudal portion of this region has connections with the middle temporal visual area (MT; Ungerleider et al., 1984) and striate cortex (Gutierrez and Cusick, 1997) and shares neurochemical characteristics with the medial division of the PI complex, PIM. For these reasons, this part of “PM” has recently been assigned to the PI complex (Cusick et al., 1993; Gutierrez et al., 1995; Gutierrez and Cusick, 1997; Stepniewska and Kaas, 1997; Gray et al., 1999). Other parts of PM may also have discrete sets of connections. The more rostral portions of the traditional PM, for example, appear to interconnect with auditory- and somatosensory-related cortex as well as with the higher order areas already enumerated. Thus, specific subregions of PM may be predominantly visual, whereas other subregions may be dominated by other modalities of sensation or participate in distributed, hemisphere-wide circuits that integrate different types of sensory information and are concerned with directed spatial attention (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1988; Mesulam, 1990; Selter, 1992; Morecraft et al., 1993). Much of the uncertainty concerning the functions of the dorsal pulvinar complex, and especially PM, can be attributed to the fact that traditional cytoarchitectonic parcellations of the pulvinar into different nuclei lack a clear relation with the different sets of neural connections. In the present study, we have investigated the organization of the dorsal pulvinar, encompassing PL and PM as well as the caudal portion of LP, by combining a chemoarchitectonic analysis with the tracing of cortical connections. Neurochemical stains included acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and immunostaining for the calcium binding proteins calbindin-D28K and parvalbumin. We have previously used these methods to reveal divisions of the PI complex (Cusick et al., 1993; Gutierrez et al., 1995; Gutierrez and Cusick, 1997; Gray et al., 1999; Cola et al., 1999). The cortical sites for injections of anatomical tracers were chosen on the basis of previous work as having the greatest likelihood of interconnecting with the dorsal pulvinar, particularly PM, but not with the inferior pulvinar complex. We intentionally paired injections of two different tracers in two different cortical areas of a single hemisphere in order to compare directly the connections of modality-specific and “high order” cortical regions within subdivisions of the dorsal pulvinar. The paired sites were as follows: prearcuate cortex and the caudal inferior parietal lobule (IPL), regions thought to be part of a network of cortical and subcortical areas concerned with visuospatial function (Baleydier and Mauguière, 1987; Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1988; Seltzer, 1992; Morecraft et al., 1993); the vision-related caudal IPL and the auditory-related superior temporal gyrus (STG; Morel et al., 1993; Hackett et al., 1998), i.e., two areas associated with different sensory modalities; and, for comparison, dorsal prearcuate cortex and the STG. The label from the individual tracer injection sites was examined first to see whether neurochemical divisions of the dorsal pulvinar corresponded to separate foci of connections. Connections from two different cortical regions of the same hemisphere were then compared to determine whether or not fibers overlap in particular subdivisions of the dorsal pulvinar.  acetylcholinesterase autoradiography brachium of the superior colliculus calbindin rostral division of the dorsolateral visual area dorsomedial visual area fundal superior temporal area inferior parietal lobule nucleus limitans lateral intraparietal visual area lateral posterior nucleus mediodorsal nucleus densocellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus medial superior temporal area middle temporal area crescent of the middle temporal area cortical area paAlt parvalbumin physiologically defined zone of dorsomedial pulvinar inferior pulvinar complex posterior division of PI complex medial division of inferior pulvinar complex lateral pulvinar nucleus dorsal PL division medial pulvinar nucleus lateral division of the PM medial division of the PM central division of the PMm parietal visual area POa suprageniculate nucleus superior temporal gyrus superior temporal polysensory area superior temporal sulcus cortical area TEO caudal, intermediate, and rostral divisions of cortical area TPO cortical area Tpt cortical area Ts3 posterior division of the ventral lateral nucleus posterior superior division of the ventral lateral nucleus wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP first visual cortical area second visual cortical area"

In a total of 691 GABA(+) neurons sampled from the 6 main geniculate layers none was seen to contain HRP grains. In contrast, the vast majority of GABA(-) neurons were densely labeled with HRP reaction product. It is concluded from these results that GABAergic cells in macaque LGN do not project to the striate cortex, as previous studies have shown for equivalent cells in cat LGN, and therefore reasons are given to consider these cells as interneurons in this nucleus. In addition, several GABA(-) neurons which were also unlabeled with HRP were observed isolated in the midst of populations of neurons homogeneously labeled with this enzyme.

The centrifugal fibers were identified in the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts of bilaterally enucleated monkeys on the basis of the principle that, following enucleation, the retinofugal fibers within the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts degenerate and fragment months before the centrifugal fibers to the retina.Normally stained axons are present in the optic tracts; chiasm, and nerves of adult rhesus monkeys 5 or more months following bilateral enucleation. Many of these fibers, revealed by the Romanes silver technique, are present in those regions which exhibit the intense glial reactions associated with the axonal degeneration of the retinofugal fibers.The axons located centrally in the optic nerves appear to be centrifugal fibers to the retina. The cells of origin of these fibers are probably in the superior collicular region, from which their axons course successively through the midbrain reticular formation, crus cerebri (and capsule of the lateral geniculate body), optic tract, chiasm and optic nerve before terminating in the retina.

Recent experimental studies have shown that parkinsonian symptoms can be alleviated by selective lesioning of the subthalamic nucleus in monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We measured the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in two unilaterally MPTP-treated monkeys in order to determine whether it was possible to obtain reversible, gradual and controllable functional impairment of this structure. Clinical, mechanographic and electromyographic results demonstrate that this technique can alleviate parkinsonian rigidity and bradykinesia without causing dyskinesia or hemiballismus. This study supports the hypothesis that the subthalamic nucleus and its excitatory projections have an important role in the mechanisms sustaining the expression of parkinsonian motor changes, and suggests that high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus could be included in treatment for parkinsonism.",,

In the dorsal layers, colour selectivity was strong for large field stimuli, but weak for moving spots. Residual colour selectivity for spots was more evident for smaller eccentricities. In comparison, ventral layer cells were less colour selective for all stimuli used. Large field responses wer weak, they often consisted of a sequence of excitation and inhibition.

All single thalamic units that could be excited by electrical search stimuli applied to the contralateral sciatic nerve were investigated. Responses of these cells to mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli applied in the periphery indicated that at least half of the sampled cells were nociceptive. Based on responses to graded mechanical stimuli applied to the periphery, 110 of the sampled cells that received a predominant input from cutaneous receptive fields were classified. There were 56 low-threshold, 39 wide dynamic range, and 15 high-threshold cells. The same neurons were also classified into five mechanical types based on a cluster analysis: types 1-5 contained 25, 34, 17, 10, and 24 cells, respectively. The fact that about half the population of cells belonged to either the wide dynamic or the high threshold group (or mechanical types 3-5) suggested that a large population of VPLc neurons respond to mechanical nociceptive stimuli either exclusively or preferentially. Responses of 63 thalamic neurons were tested to noxious heat pulses applied to their cutaneous receptive fields with a contact thermostimulator. Of these, 47 cells were excited, whereas only 16 cells did not respond. The peripheral nerve that innervated the receptive field of each of 82 thalamic neurons was stimulated with graded strengths to activate A fibers only or both A and C fibers. All tested cells responded to peripheral A fiber volleys. In addition, 42 of these cells responded to peripheral C fiber volleys. The C fiber responses could be either short lasting (a few hundreds of milliseconds) or long lasting (up to several seconds). The recording sites of 80 cells were reconstructed. Of these, 78 were in the VPLc nucleus and the remaining two were in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. No obvious relationship between the response characteristics and the locations of the cells within the VPLc nucleus was found. Sampled thalamic units had a variety of sources of input from the periphery, including both cutaneous and/or deep tissue receptive fields. The majority of the cells, however, had exclusively cutaneous receptive fields. The sizes of the cutaneous receptive fields were often very small, so that nearly half (41%) of the receptive fields of cells sampled occupied an area of skin smaller than half the foot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Nor-β-CIT may thus be a useful radioligand for imaging of the serotonin transporter. In the present study iodine-125 and carbon-11 labelled nor-β-CIT were prepared for in vitro autoradiographic studies on post-mortem human brain cryosections and for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. Whole hemisphere autoradiography with [125I]nor-β-CIT demonstrated high binding in the striatum, the thalamus and cortical regions of the human brain. Addition of a high concentration (1 μM) of citalopram inhibited binding in the thalamus and the neocortex, but not in the striatum. In PET studies with [11C]nor-β-CIT there was rapid uptake of radioactivity in the monkey brain (6% of injected dose at 15 min) and high accumulation of radioactivity in the striatum, thalamus and neocortex. Thalamus to cerebellum and cortex to cerebellum ratios were 2.5 and 1.8 at 60 min, respectively. The ratios obtained with [11C]nor-β-CIT were 20%–40% higher than those previously obtained with [11C]β-CIT. Radioactivity in the thalamus and the neocortex but not in the striatum was displaceable with citalopram (5 mg/kg). In conclusion, nor-β-CIT binds to the serotonin transporter in the primate brain in vitro and in vivo and has potential for PET and SPET imaging of the serotonin transporter in human brain.",,

In a previous work we found that injection of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline into the rostral motor thalamus induced contralateral dystonic postures, whereas myoclonic jerks were frequent after injection into the caudal motor thalamus. In the present study, we performed electrophysiological recordings in the rostral and caudal parts of the ventrolateral thalamus of two cynomolgus monkeys before and after bicuculline injections or saline injections. Discharge frequencies of thalamic neurons were increased after bicuculline injections vs. controls. Their discharge pattern was more bursty in the caudal part in which bursts of neuronal activity were correlated with myoclonic jerks. After bicuculline injection, neurons responded more frequently and less selectively to passive limb movements in both parts of the motor thalamus. Conversely, the response to microstimulation increased after bicuculline injection, particularly in the caudal part. Our data show that acute bicuculline-induced dystonia is associated with a reversible overactivity and disorganization of neuronal activity in the motor thalamus. Such a phenomenon might induce an overspreading of cortical activity leading to dystonia. We postulate that the distinct clinical syndromes observed after bicuculline injections into the rostral and caudal motor thalamus are due to differences both in the neuronal circuitry within each thalamic nucleus and in segregated cortical projections.",,"Dystonia is defined as a syndrome of sustained involuntary muscle contractions, causing twisting movements or abnormal postures (Chan et al., 1991). It is almost always exacerbated by voluntary movements and can affect any part of the body. The putative involvement of the basal ganglia in the pathophysiology of dystonia is supported by secondary dystonias in which frequent putaminal lesions are found (for review, see Bhatia & Marsden, 1994). Electrophysiological data and results from functional imaging studies suggest that dystonia may result from a dysfunction of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops, which might induce an exaggerated spread of cortical activity (see for review Berardelli et al., 1998; Hallett, 1998). The role of the motor thalamus in dystonia remains unclear (Bhatia & Marsden, 1994; Lee & Marsden, 1994; Tasker et al., 1998). It receives both basal ganglia and cerebellar inputs and projects to motor and premotor cortices (Hoover & Strick, 1999). Consequently, it is ideally suited to regulate inputs from striato-pallidal and cerebellar areas to motor and premotor cortices. Until recently, the only model of dystonia available in the monkey relied on l-Dopa injections in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1.2.3.4.-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys (for review, see Crossman & Brotchie, 1998). It has been shown that decreased medial pallidal activity is important in the pathophysiology of dystonia. In this model, thalamotomy was able to alleviate levodopa-induced chorea but not dystonia (Page et al., 1993), suggesting that pathways from the basal ganglia other than pallidothalamic projection may be important in dystonia. In a previous study, we showed that microinjections of bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist, into the ventrolateral thalamus induced dystonia (Guehl et al., 2000). The clinical type of dystonia depended on the site of injections. Rostral injections into the pallidal segment induced a pure tonic dystonia whereas caudal injections into the cerebellar segment induced myoclonic dystonia. In the present study, we compare data of electrophysiological recordings and microstimulation before and after bicuculline injections within the rostral and caudal motor thalamus. We show that bicuculline injections induce an overactivity and a disorganization of neuronal activity, with specific effects in the rostral and caudal parts."

A conspicuous feature of the light microscopic staining pattern is the presence of focal aggregations of immunoreactive terminal-like puncta within the major thalamic recipient layers (IV and VI). At the electron microscopic level these aggregations of puncta are found to be immunoreactive terminals most of which form asymmetric synapses, principally on dendritic pines and, to a lesser extent, on dendritic shafts. Outside the aggregations, most PV-immunoreactive terminals form symmetric synapses. Correlative observations in the present and other studies indicate that the aggregations of PV-immunoreactive terminals form asymmetric synapses arise from thalamic afferent fibers while those forming symmetric synapses arise from intrinsic γ-aminobutyric acid neurons. The aggregations of PV immunoreactivity in layers IV and VI form microzones of preferred thalamic afferent terminations which may contribute to the formation of functional columns based upon focussed thalamic inputs.",Calcium-binding protein; Thalamocortical synapse;,

 Orientation selectivity and dynamics in the input layer 4Cα","In this paper, we offer an explanation for how selectivity for
 orientation could be produced by a model with circuitry that is based

 macaque primary visual cortex (area V1). The model consists of a large
 number of integrate-and-fire conductance-based point neurons, both
 excitatory and inhibitory, which represent dynamics in a small patch of
 4Cα—1 mm2 in lateral area—which contains four
 orientation hypercolumns. The physiological properties and coupling
 architectures of the model are derived from experimental data for layer
 4Cα of macaque. Convergent feed-forward input from
 many neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus sets up an orientation
 preference, in a pinwheel pattern with an orientation preference
 singularity in the center of the pattern. Recurrent cortical
 connections cause the network to sharpen its selectivity. The pattern
 of local lateral connections is taken as isotropic, with the spatial
 range of monosynaptic excitation exceeding that of inhibition. The
 model (i) obtains sharpening, diversity in selectivity,
 and dynamics of orientation selectivity, each in qualitative agreement

Following long-term recovery, cells in the undeprived laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus of these animals were of normal size and those in the deprived laminae were markedly shrunken. Comparisons with animals monocularly deprived for similar periods4 indicate, however, that in 3 of these animals the undeprived parvocellular cells would have been markedly hypertrophied at the time of reopening the deprived eye, and in two of the animals, little shrinkage of the deprived parvocellular cells would have occurred by this time. Both undeprived and deprived parvocellular cells have therefore undergone marked shrinkage after the deprived eye had been reopened. The parallel shrinkage of deprived and undeprived parvocellular cells which occurs following closure at birth thus appears to be a consequence of the initial abnormalities produced by monocular closure rather than a direct result of the continuing lack of visual input to one eye.",lateral geniculate nucleus; visual deprivation; recovery; primate;,

Spectral response curves of parvocellular neurons depended on the luminance ratio between the chromatic stimuli and achromatic background. From response/intensity curves, we determined the relative luminance between a coloured and an achromatic (white) light at which a given cell became non-responsive (critical luminance ratio, CLR). The spectral dependence of the CLRs of narrow (N) and wide band (W) cells with opponent receptor input showed characteristic differences. The activity of W-cells increased with luminance increase of a white light and of a coloured light in the specific spectral region of the cell (yellow-red for the long wave length sensitive WL-, and yellow-green-blue for the short wave length sensitive WS-cells), while N-cells were activated by their specific spectral light (blue for NS-cells, red for NL-cells) and by a luminance decrease of achromatic white. N-cells discriminate best between their characteristic colour and white at luminance ratios below their respective CLR, while W-cells distinguish best between a light of their characteristic colour and white at chromatic/ achromatic luminance ratios above their respective CLR. Yellow sensitive W-cells with a narrow spectral sensitivity peaking around 570 nm and with only a small or no response to white light, could enable distinction between white and yellow of similar luminance. The findings are consistent with the opponency model of spectrally sensitive cells in the LGB. We discuss their implications for colour coding by parvocellular cells. N- and W-cells appear to behave complementary with respect to luminance information (N-cells may be compared to the cat's off-cells, W-cells to on-cells). S- and L-cells are complementary with respect to colour. The yellow sensitive WM-cells are critical for the discrimination of yellow and white, while cells with excitatory cone input from blue and red cones (W-SL-cells) may aid the perception of purple. The fact that, at different relative luminance ratios between a chromatic stimulus and a white background, the whole family of parvocellular cells is involved differently in coding for colour, may explain the different appearance of colours against a white background at different luminance ratios and the perception of induced colours.",,

In this study, the role of glycine and GABA in the inhibitory processes evoked by stimulation in periaqueductal gray (PAG) of responses of primate spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons to cutaneous mechanical and thermal stimuli was investigated by examining the effects of strychnine and bicuculline, antagonists of glycine and GABAA receptors, respectively, introduced into the dorsal horn through a microdialysis fiber. The inhibitory effects of iontophoretic application of glycine and GABAA agonists on STT cell activity evoked by noxious mechanical stimulation of the skin were selectively blocked by their specific antagonist, strychnine or bicuculline, infused into the dorsal horn. Similarly, intra-spinal application of strychnine or bicuculline resulted in a significant reduction in the PAG stimulation-induced inhibition of responses of STT cells to cutaneous stimuli. This reduction was mainly on the PAG-induced inhibition of the responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Our results suggest that glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn synapsing on STT cells are activated during stimulation in PAG and contribute to descending antinociceptive actions.",Spinothalamic tract neuron; Strychnine; Bicuculline; Antinociception; Spinal cord; Monkey;,

In each species, subpopulations of cortical and thalamic neurons are stained along the surfaces of their somata and proximal dendrites. Cat- 301-positive cortical neurons include specific groups of pyramidal cells (e.g., corticospinal but not corticobulbar or callosal neurons in the monkey sensory-motor areas) and certain GABA-immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells. In the thalamus, the relay neurons projecting to the cortex and not the intrinsic neurons are stained. The Cat-301- positive neurons are nonhomogeneously distributed in the cat and monkey cortex and thalamus. In the cortex, they are densely packed in 2 bands that in most areas include layers III and V, but that in primary sensory areas include layers IV and VI. Because the density of stained neurons, their distribution, and the intensity of their staining vary among cortical areas, the borders between neighboring areas can often be detected by the differences in Cat-301 staining. Broader, regional differences are also readily apparent, for areas in the parietal and occipital lobes contain large numbers of intensely stained cells, but most areas in the frontal and temporal lobes contain fewer, more lightly stained neurons. The same broad differences are seen within the thalamus: only those nuclei reciprocally connected with intensely stained cortical areas contain large numbers of Cat-301-positive neurons. Differences among species include variations in cell density and distribution when a given cortical area or thalamic nucleus is compared between cats and monkeys. Greater differences are seen among the other species. Immunoreactive neurons in the cerebral cortex are sparse and lightly stained in guinea pigs, are restricted to the hippocampal formation in rats, and are very rare and isolated in bush babies. Similarly, Cat-301-positive thalamic neurons are restricted to only one or 2 nuclei in the guinea pig and rat and are extremely rare in the bush baby. Cat-301 stains organized groups of neurons in the cat and monkey cortex and thalamus. In addition to the laminar organization of stained cells in all cortical areas (see above), the Cat-301- positive neurons of monkey areas 17 and 18 are grouped into radial arrays. In area 17, clusters of stained cells are present in layers above and below layer IVC. These clusters lie at the centers of ocular dominance columns, within patches stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Most of these cells are also GABA-immunoreactive.",,

We wanted to determine how the different ganglion cell types, distinguished morphologically, mapped to these regions of the brain. We injected a fluorescent dye into one of three regions of a macaque brain: the superior colliculus (SC), the pretectal region, and the parvicellular laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus. By means of an in vitro preparation, the retrogradely labelled ganglion cells were intracellularly injected with horseradish peroxidase, so as to reveal their dendritic morphology. When the dendritic-field diameters of the injected cells were plotted against retinal eccentricity, each of the three regions was found to receive input from a distinctive population of cells. The pretectal projection was dominated by cells with large dendritic fields. The SC projection was composed of a number of distinct types, with smaller dendritic fields. Parasol cells project to SC but are extremely rare. In addition to midget ganglion cells, the parvicellular laminae receive inputs from at least two additional groups. Parvicellular bistratified (PB) cells have bistratified dendritic fields, slightly larger than those of parasol cells. Parvicellular giant (PG) cells have dendritic-field, diameters larger than that of any parasol cell, ranging from 250 μm to greater than 850 μm—the largest of any primate ganglion cells. In contrast to the retinal projections of the cat, in which a specific ganglion cell type can project to different regions of the brain, each of the regions in this survey appears to receive inputs from its own distinct group of ganglion cells. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

In this study, one popular approach for quantifying oscillation interactions was considered: phase-amplitude coupling. The goals of the study were to use simulations to examine potential causes of elevated phase-amplitude coupling in parkinsonism, to compare simulated parkinsonian signals with recorded local field potentials from animal models of parkinsonism, to investigate possible relationships between increased bursting in parkinsonian single cells and elevated phase-amplitude coupling, and to uncover potential noise and artifact effects. First, a cell model that integrates incremental input currents and fires at realistic voltage thresholds was modified to allow control of stochastic parameters related to firing and burst rates. Next, the input currents and distribution of integration times were set to reproduce firing patterns consistent with those from parkinsonian subthalamic nucleus cells. Then, local field potentials were synthesized from the output of multiple simulated cells with varying degrees of synchronization and compared with subthalamic nucleus recordings from animal models of parkinsonism. The results showed that phase-amplitude coupling can provide important information about underlying neural activity. In particular, signals synthesized from synchronized bursting neurons showed increased oscillatory interactions similar to those observed in parkinsonian animals. Additionally, changes in bursting parameters such as the intraburst rate, the mean interburst period, and the amount of synchronization between neurons influenced the phase-amplitude coupling in predictable ways. Finally, simulation results revealed that small periodic signals can have a surprisingly large masking effect on phase-amplitude coupling.","burst, deep brain stimulation, parkinsonism, phase-amplitude coupling, simulation",

In area 17 of the adult, the distribution of cytochrome oxidase activity confirmed published findings. In the newborn animals, the tissue reacted as strongly for cytochrome oxidase as in the adult but the pattern of labelling was different in two respects. Firstly in layer 1 activity was stronger and occupied a wider portion of this layer. Secondly, cytochrome oxidase staining in layer 4C occupied two separate bands, a small narrow band at the bottom of 4Cβ and a wider one occupying the full width of 4Cα and spilling over into 4B. The pattern of cytochrome oxidase activity did not appear to be influenced by eccentricity in the newborn whereas, in the adult, label in 4C was more intense in cortex subserving central vision. In the lateral geniculate nucleus of the adult, the magnocellular layers and the most dorsal parvocellular layer reacted most strongly for cytochrome oxidase. In the newborn, parvocellular layers were more uniformly labelled and the difference between parvo and magnocellular layers more pronounced.

Many cells were equally responsive to Cartesian and non-Cartesian, especially concentric, gratings. Around 15% of cells in each area were significantly more responsive to concentric compared to parallel gratings; however, cells significantly more responsive to parallel compared to concentric gratings were more numerous in the cortex. While many cells responded to hyperbolic and radial gratings, few were most responsive to these gratings. Cell selectivity decreased for Cartesian and increased for non-Cartesian gratings from V1 to V2 and the relative response varied as a function of stimulus extent with respect to the CRF. Complex, nonoriented, nondirectional cells with a low aspect ratio (AR) responded best to non-Cartesian gratings. These results cannot be fully explained using Gabor linear/energy models of simple and complex receptive fields (RFs) although such models predict some cells to respond equally to Cartesian and non-Cartesian gratings. Cells significantly more responsive to non-Cartesian gratings can be accounted for by CRF selectivity influenced by modulation from the nonclassical receptive field (nCRF).

Stimuli were large in comparison with receptive-field size. Human increment thresholds were measured for comparison. The strength of responses grew in many cells from threshold up to a saturation level as a logarithmic function of incremental intensity. More complex intensity-response functions were also obtained, particularly from parvocellular layer (PCL) cells, but the shape and slope of the intensity-response function changed as a function of adaptation level only with chromatic backgrounds. As a function of adaptation level, the intensity-response functions shifted along the logarithmic abscissa but not sufficiently for a complete contrast constancy. Thus responses to any constant contrast became smaller when adaptation level decreased. The change from cone to rod responses, when possible, took place without noticeable change in shape of intensity-response functions, and much of the adaptive shift of the functions could be attributed to the change-over between rods and cones. Differences between different cells in light adaptation and dark-adapted sensitivity were large, mostly because of variation in the strength of rod input. The strongest excitatory rod inputs were found in PCL cells activated by short-wavelength light, so that the highest sensitivity at low levels of illumination occurred in blue- and blue-green-sensitive cells. The lowest increment thresholds based on cones matched the thresholds of macaque cone late receptor potentials recorded by Boynton and Whitten (3). They were also similar to human cone thresholds measured psychophysically but only for small stimulus sizes that may approximate the size of the receptive-field centers. Human sensitivity was much higher when measured with large stimulus sizes, indicating integration at post-geniculate neural levels. Light adaptation, as evaluated with respect to contrast constancy and Weber law behavior, was similarly incomplete in monkey single cells and human perception. A few cat LGN cells were studied in a control experiment; results agreed with previous findings. The light adaptation of cat cels was more complete and sensitivity higher than those observed under comparable conditions in macaque single cells and human. The maintained activity level of cells was little affected by the intensity of steady backgrounds. Thus, the steady-state hyper-polarisation of receptors was not transmitted to LGN cells.",,

This required the animal to press for a red (positive) stimulus and to withhold responses to green or blue (negative) stimuli. Errors in performance were more frequently induced by the stimulation of the lower brain stem (midbrain and pons) than that of the thalamus. Omission errors (not responding to the positive stimuli) were most frequently elicited by stimulation of the mesopontine reticular formation or structures which are anatomically and functionally related to it.

Here, the responses of different cell types to light stimuli successively replacing a white adaptation field are simulated mathematically by a simple model using known cone spectral sensitivities. Hyperbolic response functions with two adjustable parameters relate cone excitation with the output signals of each cone mechanism. For the majority of cells, differences of outputs of two cone mechanisms, receiving inputs from L- and M-cones, describe responses to chromatic and achromatic stimuli. For each opponent combination of cone inputs, either L-M or M-L, two cell types were found. Off-centre cells had lower maximum firing rates of their on-component, but were the more sensitive of the two groups, preferring dark colours, whereas on-centre cells showed better responsiveness to brighter stimuli. For all four cell types, the predictions of the equations replicated well the responses measured to stimuli varying along all three dimensions of colour space. The quantification of cell responses presented here provides possibilities for studying suprathreshold coding of colour and lightness, and the model can help to link physiology with the psychophysics of colour vision.",Macaque; L.g.n.; Colour coding; Opponent cells;,

The adverse effect of unilateral visual deprivation on geniculate cell growth was absent in those portions of deprived LGN laminae that were located opposite a degenerated patch. This finding supports the hypothesis that arrest of geniculate cell growth from unilateral visual deprivation is caused by abnormal binocular interaction. However, the concurrent findings of arrest of cell growth in the monocularly innervated LGN portions suggest that disuse may play an additional role in causing the LGN changes, since abnormal binocular interaction cannot take place in those parts of the LGN that receive input exclusively from one eye.",,

A fourth test was given only postoperatively. All problems contained a 66:1 brightness difference. In test Problem I, figures differed in total luminous flux (equal area). The targets in all of the remaining tests were matched for luminous flux. In addition, in Problem III they were equated for overall surface, and in Problem IV, for amount of contour. Preoperatively, all monkeys mastered the 3 problems and showed transfer effects across the tests as revealed by both the performance of the first 10 trials, and the reduction in total error scores on successive tests. Postoperatively, all animals reached criterion level of performance in the 4 problems with significant deficits in only the first one. Marked transfer effects were present across the last 3 tests. Findings indicate that destriated monkeys may master the discrimination of targets which differ in brightness but are equated for total luminous flux and for overall surface or amount of contour.

Cholesterol implanted into the same area, or similar amounts of testosterone propionate implanted into the posterior hypothalamus/pretectal area (4 females) or cerebral cortex/dorsal thalamus (5 monkeys) had no consistent effect on behaviour. It therefore seems likely that androgens regulate sexual receptivity in female monkeys by acting on some part of the anterior hypothalamus.

This putative pathway consists of the superior colliculus (SC), pulvinar and amygdala. While the presence of such a pathway has been confirmed in sub-primate species, it has yet to be documented in the primate brain using conventional anatomical methods. We injected retrograde tracers into the amygdala and anterograde tracers into the colliculus, and examined regions of colocalization of these signals within the pulvinar of the macaque. Anterograde tracers injected into the SC labeled axonal projections within the pulvinar, primarily within the oral, lateral and medial subdivisions. These axonal projections from the colliculus colocalized with cell bodies within the pulvinar that were labeled by retrograde tracer injected into the lateral amygdala. This zone of overlap was most notable in the medial portions of the medial (PM), oral (PO) and inferior pulvinar (PI), and was often densely concentrated in the vicinity of the brachium of the SC. These data provide an anatomical basis for the previously suggested pathway mediating fast processing of emotionally salient information.","subcortical, superior colliculus, blindsight, retrograde, anterograde, anatomy",

The actions of the opiate drugs were generally inhibitory, although excitatory or mixed effects were sometimes seen, especially with morphine and dynorphin. Drug effects could change, depending on the position of the iontophoretic electrode array or on the current employed. Naloxone sometimes antagonized the action of the opiate drugs used, but naloxone did not seem to be a drug suited for iontophoretic application.

We present here a novel high field, large-bore, vertical MR system (7 T/60 cm, 300 MHz), which was optimized for neuroscientific research in macaque monkeys. A strong magnetic field was applied to increase sensitivity and spatial resolution for both MRI and spectroscopy. Anatomical imaging with voxel sizes as small as 75×150×300 μm3 and with high contrast-to-noise ratios permitted the visualization of the characteristic lamination of some neocortical areas, e.g., Baillarger lines. Relaxation times were determined for different structures: at 7 T, T1 was 2.01/1.84/1.54 s in GM/GM-V1/WM, T2 was 59.1/54.4 ms in GM/WM and T2* was 29 ms. At 4.7 T, T1 was 25% shorter, T2 and T2* 18% longer compared to 7T.

Finally, the first high-resolution (500 μm in-plane) images of cerebral blood flow in the anesthetized monkey are presented. On functional activation we observed flow increases of up to 38% (59 to 81 ml/100 g/min) in the primary visual cortex, V1.

These findings, suggesting that normal inhibitory neurotransmission persists in LGN at a time when V1 inhibitory mechanisms are greatly altered, are consistent with physiological studies that have demonstrated a greater degree of functional plasticity in V1 than in LGN. Nonetheless, functional adaptation to partial loss of visual input has been detected in the LGN, indicating that synaptic plasticity takes place in this nucleus. In the present study, evidence for early changes in inhibitory neurotransmission were examined with immunocytochemical methods to determine if, in the absence of early GABA regulation, GABAA receptor subunits in macaque LGN are affected by adult deprivation. Immunoreactivity for α1 and β2/3 subunits of the GABAA receptor was intense within the magnocellular layers and more modest in the parvocellular layers and intercalated layers. In all layers, immunoreactivity was present in the cytoplasm and along the surfaces of relatively large somata and in dense tangles of processes in the neuropil. Double-labeling experiments demonstrated that somata and processes immunoreactive for α 1 and β2/3 were surrounded by GABA terminals but no cell intensely immunoreactive for either subunit expressed immunoreactivity for GABA, itself. Following periods of monocular deprivation by tetrodotoxin (TTX) injection for 4 days or longer, layers deprived of visual activity displayed levels of α 1 and β2/3 immunoreactivity markedly lower than those displayed by the adjacent, normally active layers. Such changes were greater as the period of deprivation increased. The changes included a loss of immunostaining in and around somata and in many neuropil elements of deprived layers. These data indicate that GABA and GABAA receptor subunits α 1 and β2/3 are expressed by separate populations of neurons in macaque LGN that are differentially regulated by visual activity. The findings suggest that rapid, activity-dependent regulation of postsynaptic receptors represents one mechanism for altering synaptic strength in the adult macaque visual system.",Receptor plasticity; Primate visual system; Monocular deprivation;,

Few studies, however, have directly examined the neural underpinning of visual perception in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), only one synapse away from the retina. In this study we recorded from LGN parvocellular (P) ON-center and OFF-center neurons while monkeys either passively viewed or actively detected a full range of contrasts. We found that OFF neurons were more sensitive in detecting negative contrasts than ON neurons were in detecting positive contrasts. Also, OFF neurons had higher spontaneous activities, higher peak response amplitudes, and were more sustained than ON neurons in their contrast responses. Puzzlingly, OFF neurons failed to show any significant correlations with the monkeys' perceptual choices, despite their greater contrast sensitivities. If, however, choice probabilities were calculated from interspike intervals instead of spike counts (thus taking into account the higher firing rates of OFF neurons), OFF neurons but not ON neurons were significantly correlated with behavioral choices. Taken together, these results demonstrate in awake, behaving animals that: 1) the ON and OFF pathways do not simply mirror each other in their functionality but instead carry qualitatively different types of information, and 2) the responses of ON and OFF neurons can be correlated with perceptual choices even in the absence of physical stimuli and interneuronal correlations.","lateral geniculate nucleus, ON-center cell, OFF-center cell, contrast detection, choice probability",

Potentials evoked by the discriminative stimuli were found to change during learning in the striate and prestriate cortex, the lateral geniculate body and the inferior pulvinar. No changes were evident in the medial pulvinar, midbrain reticular formation or hippocampus. In the inferior pulvinar and prestriate cortex the greatest changes were evident during the acquisition of the discrimination, while in the lateral geniculate nucleus and striate cortex the most marked changes were observed following attainment of criterion performance. These results are interpreted as showing a functional differentiation of the pulvinar-prestriate system from the geniculostriate system, and suggest that the inferior pulvinar is involved in the acquisition of visual pattern discriminations.",,

As a result, magnocellular signals might reach cerebral cortex appreciably before parvocellular signals. The relative speed of these two channels cannot be accurately predicted based solely on axon conduction speeds, however. Other factors, such as different degrees of convergence in the magnocellular and parvocellular channels and the retinal circuits that feed them, can affect the time it takes for magnocellular and parvocellular signals to activate cortical neurons. We have investigated the relative timing of visual responses mediated by the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. We recorded individually from 78 magnocellular and 80 parvocellular neurons in the LGN of two anesthetized monkeys. Visual response latencies were measured for small spots of light of various intensities. Over a wide range of stimulus intensities the fastest magnocellular response latencies preceded the fastest parvocellular response latencies by about 10 ms. Because parvocellular neurons are far more numerous than magnocellular neurons, convergence in cortex could reduce the magnocellular advantage by allowing parvocellular signals to generate detectable responses sooner than expected based on the responses of individual parvocellular neurons. An analysis based on a simple model using neurophysiological data collected from the LGN shows that convergence in cortex could eliminate or reverse the magnocellular advantage. This observation calls into question inferences that have been made about ordinal relationships of neurons based on timing of responses.",Latency; Single unit; LGN; Magnocellular; Parvocellular; Macaque;,

Flash-evoked multiunit activity (MUA) was recorded simultaneously from multiple LGN laminae during contralateral eye, ipsilateral eye and binocular stimulation. Evidence of binocularity was noted in all laminae except 4. Inhibitory effects included (1) binocular suppression, a 15–70% reduction in the peak amplitude of MUA during binocular, compared to monocular stimulation of the dominant eye for that lamina, and (2) non-dominant suppression, a 10–45% reduction in MUA below its spontaneous level, with stimulation of the non-dominant eye. In lamina 3, the onset of this effect often preceded that of the excitatory response to stimulation of the dominant eye, and was coincident with non-dominant suppression in lamina 2, and with the dominant eye-mediated excitatory response in contralaterally innervated lamina 1. This is consistent with a parvo/magnocellular interaction. Corresponding excitatory effects, binocular and non-dominant facilitation, were also noted throughout LGN. The latter occurred both within the time frame of retinally driven activity (15–65 ms), and at longer latencies as well. The earliest response in lamina 6 of striate cortex, the origin of the corticogeniculate projections, was 30–35 ms, thus precluding a role of corticofugal modulation in the earlier effects in LGN.",Monkey lateral geniculate nucleus; Multiunit activity; Non-dominant eye effect; Binocular interaction;,

Cells in certain nuclei such as the thalamic reticular nucleus, globus pallidus, and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra show GAD gene expression only; others in nuclei such as the basal nucleus of Meynert, medial mamillary nuclei, and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei show CAM II kinase-alpha gene expression only. A few nuclei, for example, the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the greater part of the subthalamic nucleus, display gene expression for neither GAD nor CAM II kinase-alpha. In other nuclei, notably those of the dorsal thalamus, and possibly in the striatum, GAD- and CAM II kinase-expressing cells appear to form two separate populations that, in most thalamic nuclei, together account for the total cell population. In situ hybridization reveals large amounts of CAM II kinase-alpha mRNA in the neuropil of most nuclei containing CAM II kinase-alpha-positive cells, suggesting its association with dendritic polyribosomes. The message may thus be translated at those sites, close to the synapses with which the protein is associated. The in situ hybridization results, coupled with those from immunocytochemical staining for CAM II kinase-alpha protein, indicate that CAM II kinase-alpha is commonly found in certain non- GABAergic afferent fiber systems but is not necessarily present in the postsynaptic cells on which they terminate. It appears to be absent from most GABAergic fiber systems but can be present in the cells on which they terminate. This suggests that the kinase may be differentially engaged in pre- and postsynaptic functions at certain synapses.",,

The monkeys with kainic acid pulvinar lesions were mildly impaired in retention of the pattern discrimination, but were unimpaired in the color discrimination tasks with or without the S-R separation. The monkeys with thermocoagulation lesions, like monkeys with superior colliculus lesions in a prior study, were severely impaired in performing one of the color discrimination tasks with S-R separation. These findings suggest that: (a) the inferior pulvinar, unlike the superior colliculus, does not contribute to the performance of discriminations involving S-R separation; and (b) corticotectal projections traversing the pulvinar and destroyed by the thermocoagulation lesions are crucial to the performance of discriminations involving S-R separation. The results of an earlier experiment also suggested that interruption of corticotectal fibers passing through the pulvinar impairs performance in another task sensitive to superior colliculus lesions — spatial localization of light flashes. Thus, corticotectal projections may be crucial for the contribution of the colliculus to performance in a variety of visual tasks.",monkeys; pulvinar; superior colliculus; visual discrimination; kainic acid; stimulus; response separation;,

The ganglion cell sizes have been determined by computer assisted measurement of camera lucida drawings at various eccentricities of both flat mounted and sectioned retinae. The pattern of projections of individual ganglion cells to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus has been studied using retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase. Following peroxidase injections into the parvocellular laminae of the geniculate, virtually every ganglion cell was labeled within a circumscribed zone of the retina known to project to the region of the geniculate immediately surrounding the injection needle tip. After magnocellular injections, only the largest cells of the peripheral retina and approximately 26% of the ganglion cells of the parafovea were labeled. Peroxidase injections into the superior colliculus produced labeling of scattered ganglion cells of all sizes in the retina, although no labeled cells were found within the centralmost 10° eccentricity. From these observations it is concluded that all ganglion cells of the macaque retina project to the parvocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate, but that only the largest ganglion cells of the more peripheral retina and not all cells of the parafovea project to the magnocellular laminae. In contrast, only scattered ganglion cells, although these are of all sizes, appear to project to the superior colliculus. Two major problems with the peroxidase tracing technique are described:",,

A number of conclusions may be drawn from this comparison: (1) monocular visual deprivation has major effects on cells in the undeprived LGN laminae and these vary with age at closure; (2) the initial effect of monocular closure from birth is to cause marked hypertrophy of undeprived parvocellular cells with little shrinkage of the deprived parvocellular cells, whereas late monocular closure (after 2 months of age) causes marked shrinkage of both undeprived and deprived parvocellular cells; (3) following monocular closure at birth, the LGN abnormality continues to evolve until at least 3 months of age, with a marked parallel shrinkage affecting both deprived and undeprived parvocellular cells. The initial hypertrophy of the undeprived cells is reversed and the deprived cells become smaller than normal; (4) cells in the monkey LGN are sensitive to visual deprivation until about 1 year of age, much later than previously thought. Visual experience, however, modifies this sensitivity so that the effects of monocular visual deprivation are both qualitatively and quantitatively different at different ages; (5) there are important differences between the susceptibility of cells in the magnocellular and parvocellular laminae to visual deprivation; and (6) actual shrinkage of cells to markedly below normal size occurs and the smaller size is not simply failure of growth.",visual deprivation; lateral geniculate nucleus; primate; hypertrophy;,

Most axons had terminal ramifications at one horizontal level in the ventrobasal complex. All terminations were focal, many were anteropos-teriorly elongated, though none were sufficiently long to occupy more than one-third to one-half of the anteroposterior extent of the VPLc nucleus. All terminal ramifications were compressed sagittally into a slab 200–300 μm wide. There was modest overlap in the terminal territories of adjacent labelled axons and, as judged light microscopically, only a small amount of convergence onto the vicinities of single cells. Axons terminating selectively in the anterodorsal shell or central core of VPLc could be identified. In the anterodorsal shell (of neurons responding to stimulation of deep tissues) axons tended to terminate either in the part projecting to area 3a or in that projecting to areas 3a and 2 of the cortex. In the central core (of neurons responding to cutuneous stimulation and projecting to areas 3b and 1) larger ramifications were present in its center and smaller ramifications in its ventral part. A few axons had terminal ramifications at two dorsoventral levels in the cutaneous core; others had terminations in both the dorsal deep shell and the cutaneous core. In both cases, one ramification was always smaller than the other. The termination of lemniscal axons at defined foci instead of along the dorsoventral extent of the representational lamellae of the ventrobasal complex has implications for the nature of the body representation in the nuclei. Their tendency to be focal implies that not all members of an anteropos-teriorly elongated rod of place-and-modality-specific ventrobasal cells that project their axon to a single column in the somatic sensory cortex receive afferent inputs from the same lemniscal fibers.",,

Thus, the unit activity was consistent with the equivalent background principle of visual adaptation, but not with the equivalent luminance principle. It was also found that unit response characteristics to an increment of stimulus intensity could be changed from “off” to “on” in bleaching adaptation conditions, but not in field adaptation conditions.

To investigate the physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we recorded from 260 neurons in the parvo-cellular lateral geniculate nucleus (P-LGN) of anaesthetized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), and measured their responses to 1.0–2.0° diameter spots of equiluminant light of various spectral composition, centered over their receptive field (spectral response function, SRF). Five classes of colour opponent neurons and two groups of light inhibited cells were distinguished following the classification proposed by Creutzfeldt et al. (1979). In each cell we repeated the SRF measurement while an outer surround (inner diameter 5°, outer diameter 20°) was continuously illuminated with blue (452 nm) or red (664 nm) light of the same luminance as the center spots. The 1.0–1.5° gap between the center and the surround was illuminated with a dim white background light (0.5–1cd/m2). During blue surround illumination, neurons with an excitatory input from S-or M-cones (narrowand wide-band/short-wavelength sensitive cells, NSand WS-cells, respectively) showed a strong attenuation of responses to blue and green center spots, while their maintained discharge rate (MDR) increased. During red surround illumination the on-minus-off-responses of NS- and WS-cells showed a clear increment. L-cone excited WL-cells (wide-band/long-wavelength sensitive) showed a decrement of on-responses to red, yellow and green center spots during red surround illumination and, in the majority, also an increment of MDR. The response attenuation of narrow-band/long-wavelength sensitive (NL)-cellls was more variable, but their on-minus-off-responses were also clearly reduced in the average during red surrounds. Blue surround illumination affected WL-cell responses little and less consistently than those of NL-cells, but often broadened the SRF also in the WL-cells towards shorter wavelengths. The M-cone excited and S-cone suppressed WM-cells were strongly suppressed by blue but only little affected by red surround illumination. The changes of spectral responsiveness came out clearly in the group averages of the different cell classes, but snowed some variation between individual cells in each group. The zero-crossing wavelengths derived from on-minus-off-responses were also characteristically shifted towards wavelengths complementary to those of the surround. The direction of changes of spectral responsiveness of P-LGN-cells are thus consistent with psychophysical colour contrast and colour induction effects which imply that light of one spectral region in the surround reduces the contribution of light from that same spectral region in the (broad band or composite) object colour. Surrounds of any colour also decrease the brightness of a central coloured or achromatic light (darkness induction). We calculated the population response of P-LGN-units by summing the activity of all WS-, WM- and WL-cells and subtracting that of all NS- and NL-cells. The SRF of this population response closely resembled the spectral brightness function for equiluminous lights rather than the photopic luminosity function. With red or blue surrounds, this population SRF was lowered nearly parallel across the whole spectrum to about 0.7 of the amplitude of the control. In a psychophysical test on 4 observers we estimated the darkness induction of an equiluminous surround in a stimulus arrangement identical to the neurophysiological experiment, and found a brightness reduction for white, blue, green and red center stimuli to 0.5–0.7 of the brightness values without surround. This indicates that the neurophysiological results may be directly related to perception, and that P-LGN-cells not only signal for chroma but also for brightness, but in different combinations. The results indicate that both an additive (direct excitation or suppression of activity) and a multiplicative mechanism (change of gain control) must be involved in brightness and colour contrast perception. As mechanisms for the surround effects horizontal cell interactions appear not to be sufficient, and a direct adaptive effect on receptors feeding positive or negative (opponent) signals into the ganglion cells receptive fields by straylight from the surround must be seriously considered. This will be examined in the following companion paper. The results indicate that changes of spectral and brightness responses in a colour contrast situation sufficient to explain corresponding changes in perception are found already in geniculate neurons and their retinal afferents. This applies to mechanisms for colour constancy as well in as much as they are related to colour contrast.",,

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the changes in the amino acid levels during chronic, single-sided ATN-stimulation in the hippocampi of rhesus monkeys with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy induced by kainic acid (KA). The concentrations of glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, aspartate and taurine in the dialysates from bilateral hippocampi were determined at multiple time points using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that after KA administration, the aspartate, γ-aminobutyric acid and taurine levels increased significantly in the sham-stimulation group, although the γ-aminobutyric acid and taurine levels gradually returned to the basal levels in the chronic stage. The glutamate level showed an initial decrease in the acute stage and a subsequent increase in the chronic stage. Chronic ATN-stimulation reversed the increases in the glutamate and aspartate levels, and maintained the initial increases in the γ-aminobutyric acid and taurine levels till the end of the experiment. These amino acid levels, however, were not affected by either contralateral KA injection or contralateral ATN-stimulation, suggesting that the observed effects of ATN-stimulation are restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Our data suggest that chronic ATN-stimulation may induce favorable modulations in the amino acid levels in the hippocampi of epileptic monkeys, which may be an important mechanism underlying the effects of ATN-stimulation in epilepsy treatment.",ATN; anterior thalamic nuclei; DBS; deep brain stimulation; TLE; temporal lobe epilepsy; Glu; glutamate; Asp; aspartate; GABA; γ-aminobutyric acid; Tau; taurine; KA; kainic acid; MRI; magnetic resonance imaging; PSs; partial seizures; GSs; generalized clonic seizures; HPLC; high-performance liquid chromatography; LSD; least significant difference; Anterior thalamic nuclei; Deep brain stimulation; Epilepsy; Kainic acid; Neurotransmitters; Rhesus monkeys;,

Trans-synaptic autoradiography was also used to study these pathways after an injection of H3 proline-fucose into one eye.

In both primate groups the geniculocortical input to layer IVA formed a pattern which resembled a honeycomb in tangential sections, unlike the solidly labeled layer IVC. Also common to the two primate groups was a projection from dLGN to layer VI. There was no dLGN projection to any prestriate area in any of the primates. However, after an injection limited to the prestriate cortex of Macaca, light autoradiographic labeling was seen in the interlaminar zones and the magnocellular and S laminae, demonstrating a prestriate-dLGN pathway. Our results indicate that the primate visual system differs significantly from the cat in having no dLGN projection to area 18. There are also significant differences between primates in the level at which the possibility of binocularity (of an excitatory nature) first occurs in the striate cortex because in the species studied thus far with neuroanatomical methods, Old World primates have ocular dominance columns in layer IV but most New World monkeys lack them.",,

After a sufficient period of time, the model was euthanized, and the lateral geniculate body, primary visual cortex (V1 region) and secondary visual cortex (V2 region) were removed. Through immunofluorescence, ELISA and western blotting assays, the expressions of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, in the neurons of the LGN, V1 and V2 in the glaucoma model were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The expression of key DNA repair proteins Ku80, Mre11, PCNA, DNA ligase IV and APE1 antibodies in the LGN, V1 and V2 of the glaucoma model was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), and in the positive TUNEL cells, the levels of cleaved caspase 3, Beclin 1 and LC3B-II/LC3B-I were significantly increased in the LGN of the glaucoma model (P < 0.05), but there was no significant positive expression in the V1 and V2 regions of the glaucoma model compared with the normal control group (P > 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy also showed that apoptotic bodies and autolysosomes (changes in neuronal apoptosis and autophagy activation) appeared in some neurons of the LGN in glaucoma, but there were no significant abnormal changes in the V1 and V2 regions of glaucoma or in any specimens in the normal group. In terms of neuron counting, the number of neurons in the LGN of the glaucoma model was lower than that in the normal control group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the number of neurons in the V1 and V2 regions between the two groups (P > 0.05). Similarly, the expression of glial cells in the LGN, V1 and V2 of the glaucoma model was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Therefore, the results showed that DNA oxidative damage and various repair processes occurred in neurons of the LGN, V1 and V2 of the glaucoma model, and finally, LGN neurons died in the glaucoma model.",,

A new classification for cells in the parvocellular layers (PCL) is proposed, based on their spectral response curve and their response to white stimuli: (A) narrow-band, short wavelength (NS) excited cells, activity suppressed by white stimuli; (B) wide-band, short-wavelength (WS) excited cells, excited by white stimuli; (C) wide-band, long-wavelength (WL) excited cells, (D) narrow-band, long-wavelength (NL) excited cells, activity suppressed by white stimuli; (E) light suppressed (LI) cells, activity suppressed by all wavelengths, usually with some concealed excitatory input at extreme short or long wavelengths. Responses to moving bars and to spots of various diameters (area response curves) were determined for various wavelengths. It was found that the receptive fields from which wavelength-dependent excitatory or suppressive effects could be elicited are concentrically superimposed. The spectral responsiveness of the excitatory inputs to individual cell types corresponds to the absorption curves of single cones (S-, M- or L-cone for NS, WS and WL cells respectively), the spectral distribution of the suppressive mechanisms of all cells was panchromatic and approximately fitted to a sum of all cones. The excitatory input to NL-cells cannot be related to any of the known cone absorption curves, and a simple (L-M) subtraction model is questioned. Neurones in the magnocellular layers (MCL) can be divided into on- and off-centre cells as in the cat's LGN and give qualitatively similar responses over the whole spectrum. In contrast to the tonic responses of PCL cells, MCL cells respond phasically to chromatic and white flashed spots, even with the smallest stimuli. Implications of these findings for colour processing in the LGN are discussed.",,

Physiological and anatomical features,"1. Two hundred and twenty-one spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of anesthetized monkeys were studied. The majority of the recordings were in laminae IV-VI. Thirteen of these neurons were intracellularly injected with horseradish peroxidase and histologically reconstructed. 2. A standard series of four mechanical cutaneous stimuli, which ranged in intensity from innocuous brushing to tissue-damaging pinching, were used to test the mechanical responsiveness of STT neurons. The mean alterations in discharge rate produced by these test stimuli when delivered to a neuron's excitatory receptive field were used as response measures. 3. Univariate and bivariate analyses of these response measures failed to reveal natural groupings of STT neurons. To assess whether natural groupings dependent upon shared multivariate response patterns were present, a k-means cluster analysis of the responses was performed. 4. Because an assumption about the type of coding used by the STT system had to be made prior to clustering, two independent analyses were performed. One approach assumed a labeled line coding model; response magnitudes were determined within the context of the neuron under study (within-neuron analysis). The other approach assumed a population coding model; response magnitudes were determined within the context of the STT population (across-neuron analysis). 5. The within-neuron analysis suggested that the STT sample could be partitioned into four groups. The smallest group (n = 18, 8%) responded primarily to brushing but often had a convergent nociceptive input; this group was referred to as type I. A second group (n = 31, 14%) had strong responses to low-intensity stimuli, particularly pressure, and modestly larger responses to noxious stimuli; this group was referred to as type II. The clustering in these two groups was relatively weak, reflecting some heterogeneity in response pattern. 6. The largest within-neuron group (n = 108, 49%) was most responsive to noxious stimuli but had a saturating response function; because of their apparent role in coding intermediate intensity stimuli, this group was referred to as type III. The fourth group (n = 64, 29%) responded best to the most intense stimulus used; this group was referred to as type IV. 7. The across-neuron analysis also suggested that the STT sample could be partitioned into four groups. The largest group (n = 122, 55%) had relatively weak responses to all the cutaneous stimuli; this group was referred to as type A. 8. All of the remaining across-neuron groups had mean responses at or above the mean for all cutaneous stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Overall, levels of α3, β3 and γ1 subunit transcripts were very low. In the primary visual cortex (area 17) they were concentrated in layers II and VI and in a stratum of white matter subjacent to layer VI. The localization and density of the three messenger RNAs closely resembled those of other rare (α2, α5 and β1) transcripts but their distribution also overlapped that of the predominant α1, β2 and γ2 subunit transcripts. In area 18, α3 and β3 transcript distribution resembled that in area 17, with the addition of a third band of hybridization in layer IV for β3. γ1 subunit transcript localization in area 18 differed significantly from that in area 17, with increased expression restricted to layer IV. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, β3 and γ1 transcripts were expressed at low levels across all layers while α3 transcripts were restricted to the magnocellular layers. Following 15 and 18 day periods of monocular deprivation, induced by intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin, levels of α3 receptor subunit transcripts showed modest reductions in layer VI of area 17 and in deprived geniculate laminae of adult animals. Reductions in α3 transcript levels were much more pronounced in layer IVCβ of a five-month-old monkey deprived for the same time. Levels of β3 and γ1 transcripts were unaffected by monocular deprivation in cortex and geniculate at any age. Taken together with studies of other GABAA receptor transcripts, these results demonstrate the heterogeneity of GABAA receptor messenger RNA expression in the monkey geniculo-striate pathway and the varied response to reduced neuronal activity.","activity-dependent regulation; monocular deprivation; visual system; inhibition; plasticity; CO, cytochrome oxidase; E, embryonic day; P, postnatal day; SSC, saline sodium citrate; TTX, tetrodotoxin;",

The monkey was trained to push a lever to the left after hearing a noise burst and to the right after hearing a tone. When the stimulus was presented every 3 s the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) habituated very rapidly to about 10% of initial height. With a stimulation rate of 1 every 15 s, however, the AEPs maintained full amplitude. A movement-related increase in firing rate was recorded in 81 units (80%) and could usually be detected 100–200 ms before onset of arm EMG. A stimulus-related firing was detected in 70 units (69%). Most of the stimulus-driven units (65/70) were also movement-driven. No responses correlated to the movement or to the sound stimuli were seen during passive conditions, i.e. when the monkey was not engaged in task performance.

We observed FOXP2 mRNA expression in several brain structures, including the striatum, the islands of Calleja and other basal forebrain regions, the cerebral cortex, and the thalamus. FOXP2 mRNA was preferentially expressed in striosomal compartments during striatal development. The striosomal expression was transient and developmentally down-regulated in a topographical order. Specifically, during the perinatal state, striosomal FOXP2 expression was detected in both the caudate nucleus and the putamen, although expression was more prominent in the caudate nucleus than in the putamen. Striosomal FOXP2 expression declined during the postnatal period, first in the putamen and later in the caudate nucleus. During the same period, we also detected PBX3 mRNA in the striosomal compartment of the developing monkey striatum. FOXP2, as well as PBX3 and MEIS2, was expressed in the islands of Calleja and other cell clusters of the basal forebrain. FOXP2, in combination with PBX3 and MEIS2, may play a pivotal role in the development of striosomal neurons of the striatum and the islands of Calleja. J. Comp. Neurol. 509:180–189, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"The Fox gene family encodes a large group of transcription factors, which share a common DNA-binding domain termed the forkhead motif (or winged helix), after the founding member of this gene family, forkhead, in Drosophila (for review see Kaufmann and Knochel,1996). Many Fox family members are involved in embryonic morphogenesis; mutations of Fox genes have been implicated in a range of human developmental disorders (for review see Carlsson and Mahlapuu,2002). The members of the Foxp subfamily are characterized by a zinc finger domain and a leucine zipper motif, in addition to a forkhead domain (Shu et al.,2001). FOXP2, a member of the FOXP subfamily, is the first gene that was linked to an inherited language and speech disorder (Lai et al.,2001). Previously, we and others demonstrated expression patterns of FOXP2 mRNA or protein in rodent, bird, and/or human brains (Ferland et al.,2003; Lai et al.,2003; Takahashi et al.,2003; Teramitsu et al.,2004). FOXP2 is expressed in several structures of the central nervous system during development, including the cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. This supports a role for FOXP2 in the developmental regulation of neural systems involved in motor control and procedural memory. We predicted, based on previous results from our laboratory (Takahashi et al.,2003), that FOXP2 expression in the developing rat striatum, especially in striosomal compartment, might be conserved in the human brain. Other studies have examined FOXP2 expression in the human embryonic brain, but unfortunately human brain material used in those studies was too immature to examine compartmental expression of FOXP2 in the striatum (Lai et al.,2003; Teramitsu et al.,2004). Because of the limited amount of human brain material, and for ethical reasons, FOXP2 expression in the human brain has not yet been examined at perinatal stages. The present developmental study examines the FOXP2 mRNA expression pattern in the monkey brain, which presumably resembles human brain development. This allowed us to examine, in detail, FOXP2 expression in the immature primate brain during the perinatal period. We also compared FOXP2 expression pattern with its homologous gene, FOXP1, and with two other transcription factor genes, PBX3 and MEIS2, which were previously identified as striatum-enriched genes in the rat brain (Toresson et al.,2000). FOXP2 mRNA was expressed in the striosomal compartment of the caudate nucleus and the putamen of the perinatal monkey brain, but FOXP2 mRNA expression subsequently declined during the postnatal period, first in the putamen and later in the caudate nucleus. Moreover, FOXP2, as well as PBX3 and MEIS2, was highly expressed in the islands of Calleja and other cell clusters of the basal forebrain."

The exact substrate of this increased glutamatergic drive remains unclear. The striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Using vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluTs) 1 and 2 as markers of the corticostriatal and thalamostriatal afferents, respectively, we examined changes in the synaptology and relative prevalence of striatal glutamatergic inputs in methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys using electron microscopic immunoperoxidase and confocal immunofluorescence methods. Our findings demonstrate that the prevalence of vGluT1-containing terminals is significantly increased in the striatum of MPTP-treated monkeys (51.9 ± 3.5% to 66.5 ± 3.4% total glutamatergic boutons), without any significant change in the pattern of synaptic connectivity; more than 95% of vGluT1-immunolabeled terminals formed axo-spinous synapses in both conditions. In contrast, the prevalence of vGluT2-immunoreactive terminals did not change after MPTP treatment (21.7 ± 1.3% vs. 21.6 ± 1.2% total glutamatergic boutons). However, a substantial increase in the ratio of axo-spinous to axo-dendritic synapses formed by vGluT2-immunoreactive terminals was found in the pre-caudate and post-putamen striatal regions of MPTP-treated monkeys, suggesting a certain degree of synaptic reorganization of the thalamostriatal system in parkinsonism. About 20% of putative glutamatergic terminals did not show immunoreactivity in striatal tissue immunostained for both vGluT1 and vGluT2, suggesting the expression of another vGluT in these boutons. These findings provide striking evidence that suggests a differential degree of plasticity of the corticostriatal and thalamostriatal system in PD.",,"Nigrostriatal dopamine depletion disrupts the functional interplay between dopamine and glutamate in Parkinson's disease (PD) (Graybiel, 1990; Kotter, 1994; Starr, 1995; Calabresi et al., 1997). The loss of dopamine is associated with increased diameter of postsynaptic densities at corticostriatal synapses of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats (Ingham et al., 1993) and PD patients (Anglade et al., 1996), suggesting hyperactivity at these glutamatergic synapses. These findings are consistent with rodent data showing that unilateral dopamine depletion leads to increased intrastriatal glutamate levels (Lindefors & Ungerstedt, 1990). By contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) at corticostriatal synapses is nearly abolished in 6-OHDA-treated rats (Calabresi et al., 1996; Centonze et al., 1999), suggesting that changes in corticostriatal transmission contribute to basal ganglia dysfunctions in PD. However, the exact mechanisms that underlie these changes remain poorly understood. In addition to the neocortex, the thalamus is another significant source of glutamatergic inputs to the striatum (Charara et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2004), but regulatory changes of transmission along this system in PD have not been studied. It is, however, noteworthy that the centromedian/parafascicular (CM/PF) nuclear complex, one of the main sources of thalamic inputs to the striatum, shows a significant cell loss in post-mortem brains of PD patients (Henderson et al., 2000a,b). One may therefore hypothesize that both the corticostriatal and the thalamostriatal glutamatergic systems may be affected in PD. The recent cloning of vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT) 1 and 2 provides unique tools to differentiate cortical from thalamic axon terminals in the striatum. Studies from our laboratory and others have clearly shown that vGluT1 is confined to cortical boutons, whereas vGluT2 is a selective marker of thalamic afferents in the rat striatum (Lacey et al., 2005; Raju & Smith, 2005a; Fujiyama et al., 2006; Raju et al., 2006). In the present study, we took advantage of these selective markers to examine changes in distribution and relative abundance of cortical vGluT1-containing and thalamic vGluT2-containing terminals between control and methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated parkinsonian monkeys using immunoelectron and confocal microscopic methods. To this end, we developed and characterized the specificity of a novel anti-vGluT2 antibody generated against the human vGluT2 sequence that recognizes monkey, but not rodent, vGluT2 protein. The present study demonstrates that striatal dopaminergic depletion results in an increased prevalence of vGluT1-containing corticostriatal terminals and a regional reorganization of the synaptic microcircuitry of vGluT2-containing thalamostriatal boutons in the caudate nucleus and putamen of MPTP-treated monkeys. These data demonstrate the high degree of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the striatum and raise questions about the differential roles of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal systems in normal and pathological basal ganglia function."

The course of individual axons could be followed through several thalamic levels, and in a few cases branches to both the VPL nucleus and to the intralaminar nuclei were demonstrated. Most of the axons studied, however, projected just to the VPLc or VPLo nuclei. The spinothalamic tract cells that projected to the VPLc nucleus included representatives of all known functional categories: low threshold, wide dynamic range, high threshold and “deep”. It is speculated that these different classes of spinothalamic projections could make contributions to such sensory modalities as touch, proprioception and pain.",,

Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.","visual spatial attention, primary visual cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus, multiunit activity",

Here, we characterized the signals that this pathway conveys to cortex by recording from pulvinar neurons that we identified by microstimulation as receiving input from SC and/or projecting to MT. The basic properties of these ascending-path PI neurons resembled those of SC visual neurons. Namely, they had brisk responses to spots of light, inhibitory surrounds, and relatively large receptive fields that increased with eccentricity, as well as minimal presaccadic activity. Beyond these basic properties, there were two salient results regarding the modulatory and motion signals conveyed by this ascending pathway. First, the PI neurons appeared to convey only a subset of the modulations found in the SC: they exhibited saccadic suppression, the inhibition of activity at the time of the saccade, but did not clearly show the attentional enhancement of the visual response seen in SC. Second, directional selectivity was minimal in PI neurons belonging to the ascending path but was significantly more prominent in PI neurons receiving input from MT. This finding casts doubt on earlier assumptions that PI provides directionally selective signals to MT and instead suggests that PI derives its selectivity from MT. The identification of this pathway and its transmitted activity establishes the first functional pathway from brainstem to cortex through pulvinar and makes it possible to examine its contribution to cortical visual processing, perception, and action.",,

The few remaining neurons can be safely considered as Golgi type II cells. Electron microscopic examination of such material revealed small ovoid neurons and synaptic clusters encapsulated by glia. Within the cluster there were the characteristic axon terminal of retinal origin, and a peculiar light and large profile with features of both axons (small, flattened synaptic vesicles) and dendrites (many microtubules, endoplasmic cisterns and free ribosomes) in varying proportions. These elements were also present within the heavily gliotic general neuropil and, in longitudinal section, showed segments with strongly dendritic features, and others with vesicles either scattered or grouped near synaptic specializations. Similar profiles were also seen in normal LGN. Light microscopic examination of Golgi series from adult normal monkeys revealed two types of interneurons in the LGN, both having extremely thin axons which could not correspond in size to the ambiguous profiles described above. The latter could well match the appendages so frequently shown by the dendrites of one of the interneuron types. These findings suggest that the synapses in the glomeruli of LGN previously defined as “axo-axonic” may in fact be between optic axon terminals and the dendritic profiles with synaptic vesicles delineated in this study. Thence, the role of the Golgi type II interneuron could be interpreted at least in part as lateral inhibition.",,

This study examines the temporal properties of feedforward and feedback pathways between the LGN and V1 in the macaque monkey to provide a lower bound on how quickly the cortex can influence the LGN. In so doing, we identified a subclass of corticogeniculate neurons that receives direct, suprathreshold input from the LGN that is similar in latency to that directed to other recipient neurons (4.2 ± 0.4 vs 4.0 ± 0.2 ms). These neurons also provide feedback to the LGN that is significantly shorter in latency than that supplied by corticogeniculate neurons lacking LGN input (5.1 ± 1.3 vs 11.1 ± 2.3 ms, respectively). Across our sample of corticogeniculate neurons, the shortest combined visual response latency and feedback latency was 37 ms (mean, 52.5 ± 3.8 ms), indicating that visual signals can rapidly travel from the periphery to the cortex and back to the LGN.","V1, LGN, primate, temporal, corticogeniculate, vision",

We found that repetition-related spiking suppression was most pronounced outside granular V1 layers that receive the main retinogeniculate input. This repetition-related response suppression was robust to alternating stimuli between the eyes, in line with the notion that repetition-related adaptation is predominantly of cortical origin. Most importantly, current source density (CSD) analysis, which provides an estimate of local net depolarization, revealed that synaptic processing during repeated stimulation was most profoundly affected within supragranular layers, which harbor the bulk of cortico-cortical connections. Direct comparison of the temporal evolution of laminar CSD and spiking activity showed that stimulus repetition first affected supragranular synaptic currents, which translated into a reduction of stimulus-evoked spiking across layers. Together, these results suggest that repetition induces an altered state of intracortical processing that underpins visual adaptation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our survival depends on our brains rapidly adapting to ever changing environments. A well-studied form of adaptation occurs whenever we encounter the same or similar stimuli repeatedly. We show that this repetition-related adaptation is supported by systematic changes in the flow of sensory activation across the laminar cortical microcircuitry of primary visual cortex. These results demonstrate how adaptation impacts neuronal interactions across cortical circuits.","cortical lamination, macaque, repetition suppression, visual cortex",

Analysis of responses of opponent and nonopponent cells to stationary spots, moving spots, and grating revealed transient and sustained varieties of both spectral groups as well as cells with mixed properties. The cell's temporal discharge pattern was not correlated with its color sensitivity. Cells that ere classified as sustained responders did so under all stimulus conditions tested. Most transient cells responded in a transient fashion to each stimulus tested. In a few cells, a sustained response could be shortened into a transient response by activating the cell's surroun mechanism. The conduction velocities of sustained and transient cells were determined by shocking optic chiasm and striate cortex. Among nonopponent cells, transient types conducted significantly faster than the sustained type. No such difference was found among opponent cells. Among all cells, the fastest conducting were transient nonopponent (14 m/s), while the slowest were +B-Y opponent cells (4 m/s). Intermediate were sustained nonopponent (11 m/s) and the remainder of opponent cells types (about 7 m/s). There was a significant positive correlation between a cell's shock-evoked spike latency and its visually evoked latency. These results suggest that there are at least three independent information channels in monkey geniculostriate pathway. Further characterization of these channels is in progress.",,

We present data (on male macaque) showing strong DS in a majority of simple cells in V1 layer 4Cα, the cortical layer that receives direct afferent input from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Magnocellular LGN cells are not direction-selective. To understand the mechanisms of DS, we built a large-scale, recurrent model of spiking neurons called DSV1. Like its predecessors, DSV1 reproduces many visual response properties of V1 cells including orientation selectivity. Two important new features of DSV1 are (1) DS is initiated by small, consistent dynamic differences in the visual responses of OFF and ON Magnocellular LGN cells, and (2) DS in the responses of most model simple cells is increased over those of their feedforward inputs; this increase is achieved through dynamic interaction of feedforward and intracortical synaptic currents without the use of intracortical direction-specific connections. The DSV1 model emulates experimental data in the following ways: (1) most 4Cα Simple cells were highly direction-selective but 4Cα Complex cells were not; (2) the preferred directions of the model's direction-selective Simple cells were invariant with spatial and temporal frequency (TF); (3) the distribution of the preferred/opposite ratio across the model's population of cells was very close to that found in experiments. The strong quantitative agreement between DS in data and in model simulations suggests that the neural mechanisms of DS in DSV1 may be similar to those in the real visual cortex. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Motion perception is a vital part of our visual experience of the world. In monkeys, whose vision resembles that of humans, the neural computation of the direction of a moving target starts in the primary visual cortex, V1, in layer 4Cα that receives input from the eye through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). How direction selectivity (DS) is generated in layer 4Cα is an outstanding unsolved problem in theoretical neuroscience. In this paper, we offer a solution based on plausible biological mechanisms. We present a new large-scale circuit model in which DS originates from slightly different LGN ON/OFF response time-courses and is enhanced in cortex without the need for direction-specific intracortical connections. The model's DS is in quantitative agreement with experiments.","computational model, direction selectivity, mechanisms, motion perception, ON/OFF pathways, primary visual cortex",

This study investigated the functional specificity of the lateral geniculate mucleus (LGN) of the rhesus monkey using microelectrode-recording techniques. 2. The parvocellular laminae of the LGN receive input predominantly from medium-conduction-velocity optic tract fibers, while the magnocellular laminae receive fast-conducting axons from the retina. 3. Cells projecting from the parvocellular layers to area 17 have medium-conduction velocities, while those from the magnocellular layers are fast conducting. 4. The majority of cells in the parvocellular layers have a concentric color-opponent receptive-field organization. The receptive fields of magnocellular layers cells are also concentrically organized, but their center-surround organization is independent of wavelength. 5. Responses in the parvocellular layers are more sustained than in the magnocellular layers. 6. Cells in the dorsal pair of parvocellular layers are predominantly on-center. In the ventral pair of parvocellular layers, most cells are off-center. 7. Blue-selective cells are found predominantly in the ventral pair of parvocellular layers.

Moreover, the distribution of dLGN cells projecting to extrastriate bears a striking similarity to that of neurons that stain for calbindin D-28K (Cal), a calcium-binding protein involved in regulating neuronal excitability and considered a marker for the koniocellular or “K” pathway of geniculocortical processing. In these studies, we used double-labeling techniques to examine whether Cal content characterizes all or a subset of neurons making up the geniculo-extrastriate pathway in normal macaque monkeys. After injections of cholera toxin B-subunit into the prelunate gyrus, the proportion of retrogradely labeled neurons in the dLGN that were also immunoreactive for Cal varied from less than 40% to over 80%, indicating that only a subset of the geniculo-extrastriate projection falls within the K pathway as defined by Cal content. Analysis of the injected territories indicated that identity of the extrastriate cortical target may be systematically related to Cal content in the geniculo-extrastriate projection. To see whether the Cal-immunoreactive dLGN population might potentially play a role in preserved vision after V1 damage, we also examined the dLGN of a macaque that had sustained a lesion of V1 in infancy and survived until 4 years. In this animal, large, intensely Cal-immunoreactive neurons were found scattered throughout the otherwise degenerated dLGN zones and made up over 95% of the identifiable remaining neurons. The results support an emerging view that the macaque koniocellular system is highly heterogeneous in nature and also suggest that Cal content may be a critical feature of the pathway by which visual information reaches extrastriate cortex in the absence of V1. J. Comp. Neurol. 431:168–181, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"The majority of visual processing within the primate geniculocortical system involves the so-called M and P channels, by means of projections through the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) (e.g., Merigan and Maunsell, 1993; Van Essen and DeYoe, 1995). However, alternate pathways through the dLGN exist and involve additional populations of neurons often collectively referred to as the “koniocellular” pathway or “K” channel. This channel is variously considered to (1) consist of very small neurons lying within the interlaminar zones and “S” layers (Kaas et al., 1978), (2) show neurochemical specificity as reflected in staining for proteins related to calcium metabolism such as calbindin D-28K and CaM-II kinase (Diamond et al., 1993; Hendry and Yoshioka, 1994), and (3) consist of dLGN sectors that receive “W-like” retinal ganglion cell inputs, either directly or by means of specific ascending projections from the superior colliculus (Lachica and Casagrande, 1993). However, it is not yet clear whether these distinctions refer to a common population of neurons, or whether the K channel is a set of heterogeneous pathways. Among the above criteria, the propensity of subsets of dLGN neurons to contain calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) has been used increasingly as a defining feature of the K channel. These substances, including parvalbumin and calretinin as well as calbindin D-28K, are cytosolic proteins which have been used widely as specific markers of functional subpopulations of neurons in a variety of neural systems (reviewed in Anderssen et al., 1993). Although their precise functions remain unclear, they are believed to have a role in buffering intracellular calcium concentrations and, thus, modulating neuronal excitability (Braun, 1990; Celio, 1990), in visual system maturation (Yan et al., 1996), and possibly in modulating gene expression (German et al., 1997). In the dLGN of Old World monkeys, neurons strongly immunoreactive for these markers occupy primarily the interlaminar zones and S layers; a smaller proportion is found within the laminae proper (Jones and Hendry, 1989; Mize et al., 1992; Blümcke et al., 1994). An additional notable feature of the K channel is that it overlaps compartments of the dLGN that project directly to extrastriate cortex. Specifically, the distribution of dLGN neurons that stain for calbindin D-28K (Cal) is strikingly similar to that of cells projecting to extrastriate visual cortex, being located primarily but not exclusively in interlaminar and S zones. Although most projection cells in the primate dLGN target striate cortex (V1), a small number instead project directly to extrastriate cortex, most notably to the prelunate gyrus (e.g., Benevento and Yoshida, 1981; Fries, 1981). Such pathways have been hypothesized (Rodman et al., 1990) to play a role in “blindsight,” the residual visual capacity that persists after V1 damage in humans. A critical role for the dLGN in residual vision after V1 damage — particularly damage sustained in infancy — is strongly supported by data from the cat literature. For example, early damage to primary areas in kittens leads to expansion of normal minor and/or transient geniculo-extrastriate pathways (Payne and Cornwell, 1994; Spear, 1996), in concert with improved behavioral recovery (Cornwell et al., 1989). In monkeys, early lesions of V1 lead to a hypertrophy of surviving neurons in the dLGN, suggesting expanded terminal arbors in cortex (Hendrickson and Dineen, 1982), which may likewise contribute to improved behavioral recovery (Rodman and Moore, 1997). The objective of the present study was to determine whether Cal immunoreactivity characterizes all or a subset of dLGN cells that project directly to extrastriate cortex in macaques (the “GX” pathway), i.e., if Cal is a reliable marker for the GX pathway. Moreover, this analysis was undertaken with the hope of providing some clarification of the nature, and possible heterogeneity, of the so-called K channel of visual processing. Finally, we were able to examine the presence of Cal immunoreactivity in the LGN of an animal that had sustained a lesion of striate cortex early in life, with the aim of describing the degree to which Cal content is correlated with the presence of surviving neurons in a dLGN otherwise exhibiting retrograde degeneration after V1 injury. Some of the results have been presented briefly in abstract form (Sorenson et al., 1997)."

Certain differences between first- and higher-order thalamic relays (which relay peripheral information to the cortex versus information from one cortical area to another, respectively) suggest that more bursting might occur in the higher-order relays. Accordingly, we recorded bursting behavior in single cells from awake, behaving rhesus monkeys in first-order (the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus) and higher-order (pulvinar and the medial dorsal nucleus) thalamic relays. We found that the extent of bursting was dramatically greater in the higher-order than in the first-order relays, and this increased bursting correlated with lower spontaneous activity in the higher-order relays. If bursting effectively signals the introduction of new information to a cortical area, as suggested, this increased bursting may be more important in corticocortical transmission than in transmission of primary information to cortex.","pulvinar, lateral geniculate nucleus, medial dorsal nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, ventral posterior nucleus",

Yet no satisfactory mechanistic explanation has been proposed for the origin of DS in the primate visual cortex up until now. In this paper, we hypothesize that DS is initiated in feed-forward LGN input as a result of the dynamic differences between the ON and OFF pathways. The mechanisms we propose are biology based, and our theory explains experimental data for all spatial and temporal frequencies in visual stimuli. Exploiting temporal biases in parallel pathways is relevant beyond visual neuroscience; similar ideas likely apply to other types of neural signal processing.","direction selectivity, primary visual cortex, ON/OFF pathways, temporal frequency, spatial frequency",

Anterograde degeneration was studied using Nauta and Fink-Heimer techniques. Following lesions confined to the caudal pole of Dc, a few degenerated fibers projected to the contralateral lateral superior olivary nucleus via the dorsal acoustic stria. Degeneration was distributed to the contralateral ventral and to a lesser extent dorsal nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. The contralateral central nucleus of the inferior colliculus was a major site of termination of second order auditory fibers; a small number of degenerated fibers ascended to this nucleus ipsilaterally, and a few crossed in its commissure. A few degenerated fibers also were present in the contralateral magnocellular division of the medial geniculate body. When Dc was damaged at levels which overlie the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (Pv), or after lesions involving both subdivisions, degeneration was seen in the intermediate as well as in the dorsal acoustic stria. Fibers arising in Pv coursed through Dc and were interrupted by lesions in the latter. In addition to degeneration described above, fibers projected to the ipsilateral lateral superior olivary nucleus, contralateral medial trapezoid nucleus, and bilaterally to dorsal retroolivary and to preolivary cell groups. No degeneration was seen in the trapezoid body. Lesions involving the posteroventral and anteroventral (Av) cochlear nuclei produced degeneration in the intermediate acoustic stria and in the trapezoid body, but not in the dorsal stria. Degeneration in the intermediate acoustic stria was similar to that present after lesions affecting Dc and Pv. Thus, since Av does not project crossed fibers to this structure, these findings indicate that Pv sends some fibers to the contralateral as well as ipsilateral lateral superior olivary nucleus.",,

Each visual stimulus was shown twice per day, once as novel, and after 0 to 17 other intervening items in the recognition task, on a second trial, as familiar, when the monkey could lick to obtain fruit juice if he recognized the stimulus correctly. At the anterior border of the thalamus, a population of neurons was found which responded to the stimuli only when they were familiar. The activity of these neurons was not related to lick responses. Further, in a different, visual discrimination, task, a number of these neurons were found to respond both to the familiar rewarded stimulus to which the monkey always licked, and to the familiar aversive stimulus to which he did not lick. This shows that in a reward association task these neurons respond on the basis of familiarity, providing evidence for a dissociation of recognition and associative memories. Analysis of the responses of these neurons in the continuous visual recognition task showed that the responses to familiar stimuli were time-locked to the onset and duration of the visual stimulation (brief exposures producing brief responses). The response latencies were in the range 100 to 200 ms. A 100 ms exposure of the stimulus was sufficient for the stimulus to be encoded, and a 100 ms exposure was also sufficient for a recognition related response. The magnitude of the neuronal response on trials with familiar stimuli decreased as the number of trials between the first (novel) and second (familiar) presentation of the same stimulus increased. The rate of this decay or ‘forgetting’ varied from cell to cell and was best described by an exponential function. Repeated exposure tended to slow the rate of forgetting, and two or three repeated presentations prolonged some cell ‘memories’ for more than 100 intervening trials. Although the majority of the neurons did not have such long ‘memories’, in that they responded as novel to stimuli seen on a preceding day, so that their responses could be related to recency but not to absolute recognition of ever having seen a stimulus before, 2 neurons did respond to stimuli which had not been seen for 24 h. The neurons showed some ability to respond to stimuli as familiar despite changes in viewing conditions and transformations such as 90 deg rotation. These findings indicate that the responses of these neurons at the anterior border of the thalamus are activated during recency or longer term recognition memory processing, both of which are impaired in anterograde amnesia in man. Measurement of the responses of these neurons, which appear to have access to memory mechanisms, has allowed parameters affecting such memory mechanisms to be investigated.",,

This increased responsiveness is thought to reflect sensitization of dorsal horn neurons and may help account for secondary hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The proposal that central sensitization is due to the activation of second messenger systems was tested in this study by examining the effect of trans-ACPD (trans-D,L-1-amino-1, 3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid), an agonist of metabotropic excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors, introduced into the dorsal horn by microdialysis. A low dose of trans-ACPD resulted in an increase in the responses of STT cells to an innocuous mechanical stimulus (BRUSH), but no increase in the responses to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli or in the excitation produced by iontophoretically applied EAAs. A high dose of trans-ACPD caused a transient increase in background activity, but no change in the responsiveness of spinothalamic cells to any of the test stimuli. It is concluded that low doses of trans-ACPD can selectively enhance transmission through interneuronal pathways mediating tactile inputs to spinothalamic cells.",,

Simultaneous monitoring of EEG activity from epidural and subcortical electrodes permitted an evaluation of the nature of altered central nervous system events during erroneous performance (errors of omission) on this task. The computer-assisted analysis of pre-stimulus and post-stimulus EEG frequency activity (baseline crossings) suggests that the best measure of attentive behavior from the pre-stimulus EEG is percentage of beta 2 (25–40 cps) activity. No difference could be observed between drugs or among cerebral placements in this regard. This was determined by comparing measures of EEG frequency, pooled for a given test period, with performance from the same test period. On a trial-by-trial basis, however, the beta 2 measure in the pre-stimulus epoch failed to distinguish correct responses from errors of omission. Separation between correct responses and errors of omission is possible if comparisons are made between the changes in percentage of beta 2 activity in the pre-stimulus vs. post-stimulus epochs. For both drugs, the largest absolute change in beta 2 pre- vs. post-stimulus occurs with correct positive trials and the smallest change with correct negative trials. For secobarbital, no difference could be detected between correct and incorrect positive trials. For chlorpromazine, however, there was significantly less change in beta 2 for incorrect positive than for correct positive trials. The results were interpreted in terms of the hypothesis that secobarbital produces errors by depression of the general level of activation whereas chlorpromazine acts by reducing the sensory input which is necessary for correct discrimination performance.",,

STT cells were antidromically activated from the medial thalamus (MT) and the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and received viscerosomatic convergent input from the cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferents and the left chest-forearm region. Stimulation of the SC-PB region inhibited the activity of all 30 STT neurons studied in the T1-T5 regions of the spinal cord. The minimum average current required to decrease the discharge rate of 22 cells exhibiting spontaneous activity was89 ± 10 μA (100 Hz, 100 μs duration). Currents as high as 300 μA completely inhibited the activity of most cells. Examination of the importance of frequency of stimulation from the SC-PB area on 8 cells revealed that impulses of at least 40 Hz (208 ± 37 μA, 100 μs duration)were necessary to inhibit the spontaneous activity by 60%. Higher frequencies produced greater degrees of inhibition. Stimulation of the SC-PB region also inhibited the response of 23 of 23 neurons excited by noxious pinch and 11 of 11 wide dynamic range cells stimulated by innocuous input such as blowing or brushing hair. No differences in the inhibition produced by SC-PB stimulation on cells projecting to VPL (n = 20), MT (n = 5), or both VPL and MT (n = 5) were observed. These results demonstrate that the SC-PB region may be an important brainstem site for descending inhibition of both noxious and innocuous somatic input to upper thoracic STT cells in the primate.",Analgesia; Pain; Pain modulation; Visceral pain; Thalamus;,

To address this issue, we recorded from isolated retinas using multielectrode arrays at six fetal ages: embryonic day 51 (E51), E55, E60, E67, E71, and E76. These recordings revealed that the fetal monkey retina is essentially silent at E51 and E55, with only few cells firing on rare occasions and without any obvious spatial or temporal order. Because previous work has shown that the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate are selectively innervated during this early period, our results suggest that this process is unlikely to be regulated by retinal activity. Highly structured retinal waves were first observed at E60, >1 week before the segregation of eye-specific retinal dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus projections commences. The incidence of such waves decreased rapidly and progressively during the developmental period (E67–E76) when segregated eye-specific projections become established. Our findings indicate that retinal waves first occur in the fetal monkey at a remarkably early stage of development, >100 d before birth, and that this activity undergoes rapid changes in salient properties when eye-specific retinogeniculate projections are being formed.","retina, development, lateral geniculate, lgn, spontaneous activity, primate, retinal waves",

Monkeys were trained to choose the larger of two objects, independent of distance, to obtain a reward. Based on the integration theory, the following predictions concerning this size constancy discrimination were made: 1) monkeys with pulvinar lesions, unable to code distance, should be impaired and adopt strategies based on retinal image size; and 2) monkeys with prestriate lesions, unable to code retinal image size, should be impaired and adopt strategies based on distance. Contrary to these predictions, pulvinar lesions produced no deficit; and although prestriate lesions did produce an impairment, it was due to a failure to code distance in assessing the true size of the object. Thus, monkeys with prestriate lesions consistently responded to retinal image size instead of object size. Replicating an earlier report (Humphrey and Weiskrantz, 1969), inferotemporal lesions also produced an impairment; however, errors made by monkeys with inferotemporal lesions were random and could not be attributed to any consistent strategy. All monkeys reacquired the discrimination postoperatively, indicating that there are multiple mechanisms available to the brain-damaged animal for the perception of size constancy.",,

The over representation could be accompanied by a selective expansion of central vision in parvocellular dLGN, in which case the ratio of parvocellular to magnocellular inputs to striate cortex should change with retinal eccentricity. To test this, sample ratios were determined from counts of neurons in dLGN labelled retrogradely with WGA-HRP from striate cortex at the cortical representations of various eccentricities. Parvocellular to magnocellular ratios decreased from a mean of 35:1 at the fovea to 5:1 at 15° eccentricity. Furthermore, they exceeded the ratio of Pβ to Pα ganglion cells in central retina, but not in peripheral retina, showing that the uneven P to M ratio in the LGN does not merely mirror the distribution of ganglion cells in the retina. This provides direct evidence for selective over representation of central vision in parvocellular dLGN.",Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); Striate cortex; Parallel visual pathways; Topography; Sensory scaling;,

At longer survival times, a few pulvinar neurons responded to small light spots, but sensitivity to orientation and direction of movement never returned.

The behavioral audiograms of four Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were assessed before and after receiving two-stage bilateral lesions of auditory cortex. Thresholds were assessed for each ear with the use of insertion earphones. 2. The bilateral lesions resulted in a large initial hearing loss followed by partial recovery that left the animals with a permanent hearing loss in both ears. 3. The initial hearing loss consisted of a total insensitivity to sound in the ear contralateral to the second lesion with limited hearing in the other ear. However, the animal with the most complete lesion was initially unable to hear sound in either ear. Broadband noise was often more effective in eliciting a behavioral response than tones. 4. Partial recovery occurred in all animals and was observed as early as the first week after surgery. Most of this recovery occurred during the first 3-7 wk after surgery. This rapid phase of recovery was sometimes followed by a more gradual phase although thresholds were still elevated after 94 wk. 5. The permanent hearing loss, which averaged from 30 to 44 dB, was not constant across frequency. Threshold shifts were smallest at 63 Hz and progressively increased with frequency to a maximum loss from 8 to 25 kHz with slightly less loss at 32 kHz. 6. Analysis of the psychophysical functions and threshold stability gave no indication of any nonsensory deficits in attention or vigilance. 7. These results, taken with those of previous experiments, indicate that each hemisphere is primarily involved in the detection of sound in the contralateral ear and secondarily involved in detection in the ipsilateral ear. This arrangement differs from that seen in sound localization where each hemisphere is involved with the contralateral hemifield as opposed to the contralateral ear. Thus it appears that the functional organization of auditory cortex for sound localization is different from that for the detection and identification of sound itself.",,

The possibility of a cerebellar linkage, via the thalamus with medial area 6 of the cerebral cortex was further explored in the present experiments (cf. preceding companion paper). 2. It was found that HRP conjugated to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin injected into motor cortical areas was transported beyond the thalamus to the contralateral intracerebellar nuclei when the survival time was 4–7 days. 3. It is suggested that the labeling in the deep cerebellar nuclei occurred via the thalamic relay where cerebellofugal fibre terminals had taken up the marker substance released by corticothalamic fibre terminals or by the retrogradely labeled thalamic perikarya. 4. In general, transcellular labeling of perikarya was weaker than retrograde labeling in the thalamic cells. Some of the nuclear zones in the cerebellum showed relatively dense granulations of the reaction product; in other zones only cells with few granules were seen, and large parts of the nuclei were not labeled at all. 5. The topography of secondary labeling in the cerebellar nuclei depended on the cortical injection sites. In all cases, most labeling was found in the contralateral dentate nucleus. The interposed nucleus received a fair amount of heavy labeling only in the precentral arm and face cases. Very little labeling was seen in the fastigial nucleus and in the cerebellar nuclei ipsilateral to the cortical injections. A somatotopic organization of secondary labeling was noted in the precentral cases with the face being represented caudally, the hindlimb rostrally and the arm between the face and the hindlimb representation. This is in agreement with previous anatomical and electrophysiological investigations. 6. These observations thus lend support to the conclusion that the SMA receives a transthalamic input not only from the basal ganglia but also from the cerebellum, especially from its lateral, neocerebellar portion.",,

The new model introduces variability of the widths of subregions in V1 neuron receptive fields. As a consequence different model V1 neurons prefer different spatial frequencies. The model cortex has distributions of spatial frequency selectivity and of preference that resemble experimental findings from the real V1. Two main sources of spatial frequency selectivity in the model are the spatial arrangement of feedforward excitation, and cortical nonlinear suppression, a result of cortical inhibition.",,

In this study, the temporal structure of bursts and the timing of neuronal discharges that precede or follow them were examined in neuronal spike trains recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external and internal pallidal segment (GPe, GPi) in two awake Rhesus monkeys before and after they were rendered hemiparkinsonian by unilateral intracarotid infusion of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Bursts were detected by the “surprise” method. In the normal state, interspike intervals (ISIs) preceding or following bursts were frequently significantly longer than the average baseline ISI, and their duration was correlated with the burst length (i.e., the number of spikes/burst). Significant correlations were also found in all three structures between the burst length and the duration of interburst intervals. The incidence of burst discharges and the proportion of time spent in bursts increased in GPe, STN, and GPi after MPTP treatment. Burst lengths became more tightly related to preburst ISIs in the STN after MPTP treatment and to postburst ISI duration in all three structures. These results show that bursts in spontaneous GPe, STN, and GPi discharge are often preceded or followed by long ISIs, and that burst length, the length of pre- and postburst ISIs, and the length of interburst intervals are related to one another. Complex changes in these interactions may contribute to abnormal information processing in parkinsonism.",,

A visual cue—placement of food under one of two test objects—was succeded by a delay of 18 sec, during which the test objects were concealed and out of reach. At the end of the delay, the objects were made accessible for choice and, if the choice was correct, for reward. Single unit activity was recorded from thalamic nuclei during DR performance. The parvo- and magnocelularis portions of the nucleus medialis dorsalis (MD) were principally explored. Units spontaneously exhibiting rhytmic firing were commonly observed, particularly in MD pars magnocellularis. According to temporal patterns of firing frequency changes during DR trials, 6 different types of units were distinguished. Approximately one-half of all the units sampled in MD, pars parvocellularis, showed sustained elevations of discharge during the delay. These findings are comparable to those made in a separate study of the prefrontal cortical area to which MD, pars parvocellularis, is connected. The firing changes correlated with the behavioral task are interpreted as manifestations of a functional involvement of MD, together with the prefrontal cortex, in DR performance. The possible nature of this involvement is discussed in relation to the available evidence from anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral research.",,

Antibodies to the enzymephenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) were employed to map the distribution of epinephrine-containing axonal profiles in the primate spinal cord. Smooth longitudinally oriented fibers were localized to the outer edge of the lateral funiculus. PNMT-containing axonal enlargements were distributed to the superficial dorsal horn, intermediate gray matter and the region surrounding the central canal at all spinal cord levels. PNMT-immunostained profiles were also observed in the intermediolateral cell column. A double labeling study employing retrograde transport of HRP from the spinal cord and PNMT immunohistochemistry identified a small population of HRP-PNMT-labeled neurons in the ‘C1’ region at the levels of the medulla and ponto-medullary junction. Thus, these cells are a probable source of adrenergic input to the spinal cord. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that iontophoresis of epinephrine onto identified primate spinothalamic tract neurons in the lumbar dorsal horn resulted in inhibition of the glutamate-induced firing of these cells. The data from these studies support the hypothesis that adrenergic (PNMT-containing) cells in the caudal brainstem project to all levels of the cord and may contribute to descending modulation of nociceptive processing at these levels.",C1; Catecholamine; Immunohistochemistry; Bulbospinal; Monkey; Noradrenaline; Descending modulation;,

Thus, to better characterize the neuronal target sites of LRRK2 mutations in the primate brain, we studied the cellular and ultrastructural localization of Lrrk2 immunoreactivity in the monkey basal ganglia. As previously described, the monkey striatum was the most enriched basal ganglia structure in Lrrk2 labeling. Both projection neurons and parvalbumin-containing GABAergic interneurons displayed Lrrk2 immunoreactivity. At the electron microscopic level, striatal Lrrk2 labeling was associated predominantly with dendritic shafts and subsets of putative glutamatergic axon terminals. At the pallidal level, moderate cellular Lrrk2 immunostaining was found in the external globus pallidus (GPe), while neurons in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) were devoid of Lrrk2 immunoreactivity. Strong labeling was associated with cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the primate substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area harbored a significant level of Lrrk2 labeling, while neurons in the subthalamic nucleus were lightly immunostained. Most thalamic nuclei were enriched in Lrrk2 immunoreactivity, except for the centromedian nucleus that was completely devoid of labeling. Thus, Lrrk2 protein is widely distributed in the monkey basal ganglia, suggesting that gene mutations in PD may result in multifarious pathophysiological effects that could impact various target sites in the functional circuitry of the primate basal ganglia.","striatum, putamen, caudate nucleus, Parkinson’s disease, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, centromedian nucleus, globus pallidus, dopamine",

Peak responses to bradykinin of the three cell groups were not different. LM-STT cells began to respond and reached peak responses slightly earlier than the other two groups.

Responses to bradykinin were not dependent on the type of somatic input or cell location. Responding cells most often received A delta- and C-fiber sympathetic input, but some responding cells had only A delta-input.

The labeled material was injected into the main body representation areas of the precentral motor cortex and into various regions of Brodmann's areas 6, 8 and 9 of the frontal lobe. The ipsilateral subthalamic nucleus receives a moderately strong and somato-topically organized projection from Woolsey's precentral motor cortex. This projection is mainly restricted to the lateral moiety. The remaining nucleus is occupied by less intensive projections from premotor and prefrontal areas. It is concluded that the subthalamic nucleus is a convergence site of pallidal and corticomotor and frontal projections. Cortical afferents may exert an influence on the pallido-subthalamic-pallidal inhibitory feedback loop.",,

The possible reversal of an experimental deprivation condition is obviously of considerable importance in the clinical treatment of childhood amblyopia. Unilateral eyelid closure in kittens or baby monkeys causes most visual cortical neurons to become unresponsive to the deprived eye. In kittens, “reverse suture” leads to “recapture” of cortical cells by the initially deprived eye, if done sufficiently early. In the monkey also, reverse suture causes total recapture if done early with expansion of the ocular dominance “columns” in layer IVc of area 17 related to the newly opened eye. Late reversal is ineffective and intermediate reversal causes partial recapture.Monocular deprivation also affects normal cell growth in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of monkeys, such that the neurons innervated by the deprived retina are smaller than normal. Reverse suture in kittens leads to a recovery of cell size in the initially deprived LGN laminae and to a shrinkage in the others. In the monkey, monocular deprivation leads to less effect on LGN cells than in the cat; reverse suture results in recovery of LGN cell size.",,

Segregation of functionally distinct optic axons,"The fibre organization of the monkey's optic tract was examined by implanting pellets of horseradish peroxidase into different locations within the tract, or into the superior colliculus and pretectum. Retinae were examined for the distribution, size, and morphological types of retrogradely labelled ganglion cells; optic tracts were examined for the distribution of anterogradely and retrogradely labelled axonal profiles; and lateral geniculate nuclei were examined for the distribution of anterogradely labelled processes within distinct geniculate laminae. Localized implants in the optic tract produced retrograde labelling of ganglion cells across wide regions of the retinal surface. The maximum density of labelled cells was always substantially less than the total ganglion cell density known to be present at those retinal loci. Distinct retinal ganglion cell types were labelled from differing regions within the optic tract: implants into the deep (dorsal) portion of the tract, far removed from the outer, pial, surface, retrogradely labelled predominantly Pβ retinal ganglion cells, whereas implants into the superficial (ventral), subpial, part of the tract retrogradely labelled primarily the other retinal ganglion cell types, i.e., the Pα, Pγ, and Pϵ cells. Within any given class of axon, there is a mapping of the centroperipheral retinal axis across the deep-to-superficial dimension of the tract, but this retinotopy is extremely coarse. Anterograde labelling of axonal terminations within the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a corresponding specificity for distinct geniculate laminae, the deep implants labelling the parvocellular laminae, superficial implants labelling the magnocellular laminae. Implants into the visual centres of the midbrain produced retrograde axonal labelling rostral to the lateral geniculate nucleus only in the superficial part of the optic tract. These results demonstrate that the monkey's optic tract is not a simple topographic mapping of retinal eccenticity. Rather, the primary organizational principle is that of a segregation of functionally distinct optic axon classes. As fibre order in the mammalian optic tract is also a chronological index of axonal arrival during development, the present results provide specific predictions about the temporal order of ganglion call genesis and axonal addition within the visual pathway. They also provide an anatomical basis for the functionally selective visual impairments that may arise following local damage to the optic tract in humans.",,

Comparison of the densities (cells/deg2) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) cells, respectively, representing color-opponent and broad-band ganglion cells, with cortical magnification (mm2/deg2) gives the number of afferents per square millimeter in striate cortex (V1). For P cells, this afferent density rises only slightly with eccentricity, indicating that V1 magnification is approximately proportional to the density of P cells. The density of cytochrome oxidase puffs in V1 also rises only slightly with eccentricity. As a result, the number of P-cell afferents per puff-centered module is remarkably constant throughout V1. Our findings thus support a novel hypothesis of peripheral scaling, in which V1 cortical magnification is based on the mapping of just 1 class of afferent onto V1 modules. This “P-cell module” in V1 may be composed of submodules corresponding anatomically to the honeycomb cell in layer 4A of V1 and physiologically to a minimal complete set of color-opponent ganglion cells. In contrast, the afferent density of M cells rises steeply with eccentricity, so that the reciprocal of their afferent density, the cortical “domain” of M cells, declines with eccentricity. This decline is similar to that of point-image area in V1. As a result, the number of M cells per point-image area is nearly constant. This quantity is analogous to the receptive-field coverage factor in the retina, which for M cells is fairly constant and greater than unity at all eccentricities. The results show fundamental differences between the neural maps of these 2 major cell types, differences that are likely to have psychophysical consequences.",,

We recently developed the new radioligand [11C]FLB 457, which is suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of extrastriatal D2 dopamine receptors. The purpose of this PET study was to examine the effect of amphetamine on [11C]FLB 457 binding in extrastriatal regions. Each of three cynomolgus monkeys was examined at baseline conditions, 15 min and 3 h after I.V. injection of amphetamine (2 mg/kg). The effect of amphetamine was calculated from the ratio of specific [11C]FLB 457 binding to the binding in the cerebellum, a region which was used as reference for free and nonspecific binding in the brain. The changes of the ratio in the striatum, the thalamus, and the neocortex were between −1.2% and −15.5% at 15 min and −2.1% and −16.3% at 3 h, respectively, after amphetamine administration. The reductions of the binding ratios in the extrastriatal regions are similar to those reported for [11C]raclopride binding in the striatum. These data in a limited series of monkeys suggest that [11C]FLB 457 binding to D2 dopamine receptors in extrastriatal regions is sensitive to changes in the concentration of endogenous dopamine.

We asked what mechanism accounts for this selectivity at the retinogeniculate synapse. The amplitude of synaptic potentials was remarkably constant, ruling out a major role for presynaptic mechanisms such as synaptic facilitation. Instead, geniculate spike trains could be predicted from retinal spike trains on the basis of postsynaptic summation. This simple form of integration explains the response differences between a geniculate neuron and its main retinal driver, and thereby determines the flow of visual information to cortex.",,

Each cell had a somatic receptive field in the left chest region and was excited by electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers. Gallbladder distension to pressures between 20 and 100 mmHg increased activity in 16 of 44 neurons. Responses usually consisted of bursts of activity associated with increased gallbladder pressure (phasic responses) followed by maintained activity during the distension (tonic responses). Magnitude of phasic responses was linearly related to the distending pressure and was consistently greater than magnitude of tonic responses. The gallbladder-responsive and nonresponsive groups included similar proportions of wide dynamic range, high threshold, and high-threshold inhibitory cells. Nine of 10 gallbladder-responsive cells and 11 of 21 gallbladder-nonresponsive cells increased their discharge rate after injection of 2 micrograms/kg bradykinin into left atrium. Activity of cells with gallbladder input increased from 14 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 4 spikes/s. Cells without gallbladder input increased their discharge rate to a significantly less degree (10 +/- 3-23 +/- 4 spikes/s). These results indicate that upper thoracic STT neurons may increase their activity during gallbladder distension. Convergence of afferent information from the chest and gallbladder may explain chest pain occurring during gallbladder disease. Furthermore the tendency of gallbladder-responsive cells to respond to bradykinin injections with a high rate of discharge could explain how this chest pain of gallbladder origin may closely mimic pain of angina pectoris.",,

Systematic study of the complexation reaction of DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-Octreotide (DOTATOC, where DOTA is the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) with 67Ga, 68Ga, 69,71Ga and in the presence of competing metal cations [Al(III), Fe(III), In(III)] was performed using conventional and microwave heating techniques and assessed by mass spectrometry. Saturation binding of 68Ga-DOTATOC to Rhesus monkey brain slices was performed using frozen section autoradiography. High SRA was necessary in order to characterize the saturation binding of 68Ga-DOTATOC to somatostatin receptors in Rhesus monkey brain sections. The complexation of Ga(III) with DOTATOC suggested more favorable formation compared to Fe(III) and In(III). The microwave heating mode might influence the selectivity of the complexation reaction, especially when comparing the behavior of Ga(III) and In(III). Al(III) was less critical with contamination and could be tolerated up to a concentration equal to that of the peptide bioconjugate. The SRA of 67Ga-DOTATOC and 67Ga-NODAGA-TATE (NODAGA-Tyr3-Octreotate, where NODAGA is 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1-glutaric acid-4,7-diacetic acid) exceeded literature data by a factor of 7 and 5–15, respectively. High SRA was critical for providing sufficient contrast and accurate quantification of PET images.

Both MDmc and Ant N project, in turn, to the prefrontal cortex, mainly to its ventral and medial portions. To test whether the prefrontal projection targets of the two limbothalamic pathways also participate in memory functions, performance on a variety of learning and memory tasks was assessed in monkeys with lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Group VM). Normal monkeys and monkeys with lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Group DL) served as controls. Group VM was severely impaired on a test of object recognition, whereas Group DL did not differ appreciably from normal animals. Conversely, the animals in Group VM were able to learn a spatial delayed response task, whereas 2 of the 3 animals in Group DL could not. Neither group was impaired in the acquisition of visual discrimination habits, even though the successive trials on a given discrimination were separated by 24-h intervals. The patterns of deficit suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex constitutes another station in the limbothalamic system underlying cognitive memory processes, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lies outside this system. The results support the view that the classical delayed-response deficit observed after dorsolateral prefrontal lesions represents a perceptuo-mnemonic impairment in spatial functions selectively rather than a memory loss of a more general nature.",ventromedial prefrontal cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; visual recognition; monkey;,

In primates, tonically active neurons (putative cholinergic interneurons) exhibit multiphasic responses to motivationally salient stimuli that mirror those of midbrain dopamine neurons and together these two systems mediate reward-related learning in basal ganglia circuits. Here, we addressed the potential contribution of cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs to the characteristic multiphasic responses of cholinergic interneurons in vivo. We first recorded and labeled individual cholinergic interneurons in anesthetized rats. Electron microscopic analyses of these labeled neurons demonstrated that an individual interneuron could form synapses with cortical and, more commonly, thalamic afferents. Single-pulse electrical stimulation of ipsilateral frontal cortex led to robust short-latency (<20 ms) interneuron spiking, indicating monosynaptic connectivity, but firing probability progressively decreased during high-frequency pulse trains. In contrast, single-pulse thalamic stimulation led to weak short-latency spiking, but firing probability increased during pulse trains. After initial excitation from cortex or thalamus, interneurons displayed a “pause” in firing, followed by a “rebound” increase in firing rate. Across all stimulation protocols, the number of spikes in the initial excitation correlated positively with pause duration and negatively with rebound magnitude. The magnitude of the initial excitation, therefore, partly determined the profile of later components of multiphasic responses. Upon examining the responses of tonically active neurons in behaving primates, we found that these correlations held true for unit responses to a reward-predicting stimulus, but not to the reward alone, delivered outside of any task. We conclude that excitatory inputs determine, at least in part, the multiphasic responses of cholinergic interneurons under specific behavioral conditions.","basal ganglia, corticostriatal, parafascicular nucleus, thalamostriatal, tonically active neuron",

Responses of ganglion cells of the magnocellular (MC) pathway were much more vigorous than those of cells of the parvocellular (PC) pathway. From the variability in the number of impulses in the response as compared with the distribution of impulses in maintained activity, it was possible to generate receiver operating characteristics for cells of the two pathways, and to predict individual cells' capability to detect a displacement with 75% probability. On comparing cell sensitivities to human psychophysical thresholds (75% probability of correct identification of displacement direction) at an equivalent retinal eccentricity (approximately 6 degrees), we found that one or two additional impulses in two MC pathway cells would suffice to support an ideal detector underlying psychophysical performance, at all contrast levels. Many more PC pathway cells would be required, especially at low contrasts. The much higher signal-to-noise ratio in the MC pathway relative to the PC pathway indicates that the MC pathway is likely to support this and other hyperacuity tasks.",,

With rising contrast, the M cells' responses to sinusoidal stimuli show an increasing attenuation at low temporal frequencies while the P cells' responses scale uniformly.

These data provide further physiological evidence that the M-cell pathway differs from the P-cell pathway with regard to the functional elements in the retina.

The pathobiology of LGN degeneration in glaucoma is as yet unknown. We investigated whether peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress plays a role in glaucomatous degeneration of the LGN. Nitrotyrosine (NT), a marker for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative injury, was studied in right LGN sections from monkeys with experimental unilateral glaucoma in the right eye and from normal controls. Immunoreactivity for NT was analyzed using bright-field microscopy. The density of NT profiles localized in neural tissue was determined for LGN layers (2,3,5) connected to the glaucoma eye and LGN layers (1,4,6) connected to the non-glaucoma eye. Density was calculated for each LGN layer by dividing the number of NT profiles by the cross-sectional area of each LGN layer. Blood vessels in each LGN were examined for NT formation. NT formation was detected in LGN layers of all monkeys with glaucoma. Quantitative analysis revealed that compared to controls, the density of NT profiles was increased in monkeys with glaucoma in LGN layers connected to glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes. The mean density of NT profiles (±sem) in neural tissue was significantly increased in glaucoma LGN layers compared to those of controls (2·30±0·56 vs. 0·29±0·12; P=0·016).

Animal studied Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Procedures Unilateral chronic elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) was induced in six rhesus monkeys by laser photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork. Four normal monkeys were used as controls. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100β and parvalbumin was used to specifically label astrocytes and neurons in the LGN. The relative immunointensity (RI) of GFAP was defined as the ratio of intensity between each region of interest to a reference field and compared between the experimental and control groups as a function of percentage optic nerve fiber loss. Ultrastructural changes of LGN astrocytes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results An increase in GFAP and S100β immunoreactivity was observed in the LGN layers receiving projections from the experimental glaucoma eyes. Quantitative analysis revealed that the RI of GFAP in both the magnocellular and parvocellular layers connected to the glaucomatous eyes increased in a linear fashion with increasing optic nerve fiber loss. Compared to controls, the RI of GFAP was also moderately elevated in LGN layers connected to the fellow nonglaucomatous eyes. Ultrastructurally, accumulation of glial filaments that occurred throughout the perikaryon and extended into the process in reactive astrocytes was observed in LGN layers of glaucomatous monkeys. Conclusions Reactive astrogliosis occurs in the magnocellular and parvocellular LGN layers of monkeys with unilateral glaucoma. Astrocytes may play an important role in the regulation of LGN microenvironment in glaucoma.",,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, and is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells.1,2 Recent evidence suggests that trans-synaptic degeneration, which has been reported in diverse neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is also implicated in the pathophysiology of glaucoma.3–5 In experimental monkey glaucoma, the degenerative changes of neurons have been observed in magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular pathways in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and these changes have been presented in relation to intraocular pressure (IOP) and the severity of optic nerve damage.6–8 Peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative injury was reported to be involved in the glaucomatous LGN.9 However, our knowledge of the pathological processes responsible for degenerative changes in the glaucomatous LGN is still limited. The classic concept of astrocytes acting as a scaffold, keeping neurons in their proper location, has during the last decades been replaced with the more dynamic view that astrocytes actively maintain and support neuronal activity.10 Astrocytes commonly undergo a dramatic transformation known as astrogliosis in response to diverse forms of central nervous system injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the major constituent of the intermediate filaments of the astrocyte, is a well established marker for astrocytes. Increased expression of GFAP by reactive astrocytes is present in various pathological conditions.11,12 Also, S-100β is a calcium-binding peptide produced by astrocytes throughout the brain and mainly located in the cell bodies.13 Since astrogliosis is arguably the most prominent cellular response to diverse neuronal injuries and may play an important role in the regulation of LGN microenvironment in glaucoma, we investigated the astrocytic response to glaucomatous damage in the LGN by evaluating the immunoreactivity of GFAP and S-100β at the light microscopic level, as well as by analyzing the ultrastructural changes in astrocytes in the LGN of monkeys with experimental glaucoma."

In the LGN of normal monkeys, numerous PV-positive neurons, including the largest neurons in the nucleus, and many PV-positive processes occur in all six laminae. After monocular enucleation, PV immunoreactivity is reduced in the neuropil of the denervated laminae compared to adjacent nondenervated and to normal laminae. PV immunoreactivity of somata in denervated laminae, however, appears to be indistinguishable from that of somata in nondenervated laminae, although neurons in the denervated laminae are smaller in size. Since LGN neurons in denervated laminae have lost their visual input, the functional role of PV in this nucleus may not relate directly to visual information processing.",Primate lateral geniculate nucleus; Denervation; Calcium-binding protein;,

II. Cerebellar projections compared with those of the ascending somatic sensory pathways in lateral diencephalon,"Previous studies have shown that ascending somatic sensory pathways arising from the dorsal column nuclei, lateral cervical nucleus and spinotha-lamic tract terminate in parts of the thalamus adjacent to those which receive cerebellar terminations. This termination pattern creates a border between the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPL) and the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) in the cat and between the caudal and oral parts of VPL (VPLc and VPLo, respectively) in the monkey. Since it is not clear how sharp these borders are, a double orthograde labeling strategy was used in the present study to make direct comparisons of the projections to the thalamus from these sources of input. It was found that there was a change in the sources of afferent input to the different target areas that paralleled changes in cytoarchitecture. Moving caudally to rostrally, VPL in the cat and VPLc in the monkey received projections predominantly from the middle, dorsal (clusters) portion of the dorsal column nuclei. These projections were gradually replaced near the VPL-VL border in the cat and VPLc-VPLo border in the monkey first by input from the lateral cervical nucleus (cat only) and the rostral and ventral portions of the dorsal column nuclei and then by spinothalamic projections. Towards VL in the cat and the rostral parts of VPLo in the monkey (referred to as Vim by Hassler, '59 and Mehler, 71), these projections were in turn replaced by those from the cerebellum. This sequence resulted in a complex pattern (summarized in Fig. 10) where some thalamic territories received input predominantly trom one source and others received converging input from several sources. The major region receiving converging ascending somatic sensory and cerebellar terminations was located at the border between VPL and VL in the cat and in the caudal parts of Olszewski's ('52) VPLo in the monkey (that is, between VPLc and Vim). In general, the results in the cat were similar to those in the monkey. One notable difference was that the domain containing terminals from the cerebellum and the rostral-ventral parts of the dorsal column nuclei was located medially between VPLc and Vim in the monkey, whereas it extended across the entire mediolateral border between VPL and VL in the cat. In both species, thalamic neurons received input predominantly from one afferent source and only minor input, if any, from other sources. This dominance of a single source of afferent input occurred even for neurons located in domains that received converging input from several sources. When considered together with the results of others, the results presented here indicate that the “core” and “shell(s)” regions of VPL noted by a number of authors (e.g., Bowsher, '66; Andersson et al., '66; Whitsel et al., '78; Berkley, '80; Friedman and Jones, '81; Spreafico et al., '81) cannot be sharply separated from each other or from more rostral regions by their pattern of afferent input, their efferent output or their cytoarchitecture. Such a situation permits flexibility in the processing of different types of somatic information and indicates that regions subserving different functions in the realms of somatic sensation and kinesthesia are only roughly separated from one another. In addition, in agreement with others, the results suggest that, in both species, one possible function of the domain containing the converging cerebellar and ascending somatic sensory terminations involves the processing of somatic information related to the activation of receptors located in muscles, joints, tendons, vestibular apparatus and other deep tissues.",,

A fundamental piece of information lacking to date is the detailed anatomical connections of the face patches. Here, we injected retrograde tracers into four different face patches (PL, ML, AL, AM) to characterize their anatomical connectivity. We found that the patches are strongly and specifically connected to each other, and individual patches receive inputs from extrastriate cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and three subcortical structures (the pulvinar, claustrum, and amygdala). Inputs from prefrontal cortex were surprisingly weak. Patches were densely interconnected to one another in both feedforward and feedback directions, inconsistent with a serial hierarchy. These results provide the first direct anatomical evidence that the face patches constitute a highly specialized system, and suggest that subcortical regions may play a vital role in routing face-related information to subsequent processing stages.",,

Injections of anterogradely transported tracers were placed selectively in the caudal nucleus of the spinal trigeminal nuclear complex, and retrogradely transported horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or fluorescent dyes were placed on the surface or into the depths of defined parts of the trigeminal representation in the first somatic sensory area (SI) of the cerebral cortex. The results are correlated with those of the preceding paper (Rausell and Jones, 1991), which demonstrated the presence of 2 domains in the nucleus on the basis of different patterns of cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining and calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity. The cells of the CO-defined rod and matrix domains receive inputs from different components of the trigeminal afferent system and project to different layers of SI. The large- and medium-sized relay cells of the CO-rich rods, which are immunoreactive for parvalbumin, all project to middle layers of SI. The small relay cells of the weakly-stained CO-matrix, surrounding and intervening between the rods, are immunoreactive for 28-kDa calbindin and project to superficial layers (I and II) of SI. Anterograde tracing studies reveal that the rod domain in VPM is innervated by fibers arising in the contra- and ipsilateral principal trigeminal nucleus, while the matrix domain (and calbindin-positive domains in adjacent nuclei) are innervated by fibers arising in the caudal nucleus of the spinal trigeminal complex. These results demonstrate the modularity and parallel streaming of the functional components of the trigeminal part of the somatic sensory system and suggest that lemniscal and nonlemniscal elements of the system gain access by separate routes to different layers of the SI cortex.",,

From the data it appears that the major efferent projections of the nucleus are to the pallidal complex and the substantia nigra. In both monkey and cat, the projection to the pallidal complex is truly massive and is directed at both pallidal segments. The projection field includes an infracommissural part of the pallidal complex bordering on the substantia innominata. In the monkey the termination in the pallidal complex is organized in several characteristic bands oriented parallel to the medullary laminae. The subthalamo-pallidal projection in monkey further appears to be topographically organized. The projections to the substantia nigra is prominent in both cat and monkey though not as massive as that to the pallidal complex. The distribution of termination in the substantia nigra favors the more ventral strata near the cerebral peduncle. In the monkey the terminal distribution appears to avoid regions of the substantia nigra containing pigmented neurons and it is suggested that the subthalamonigral pathway may prefer non-dopaminergic neurons. In addition to the above major projections, sparse projections were noted to the thalamic nuclei ventralis lateralis and ventralis anterior, to the putamen, and to the mesencephalic nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus, pars compacta. The findings are discussed.",,

The MDRs of tract fibers and LGN cells differ at high luminance levels because of a stronger tonic antagonism from the LGN receptive field surround than from optic tract receptive field surrounds. These differences in surround antagonism can be demonstrated with transient stimuli also. Results further suggest that while optic tract fibers can accurately convey absolute luminance signals, LGN cells cannot. Results are discussed in terms of receptive field organization.",,

We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of high-resolution postmortem dMRI and probabilistic tractography in rhesus macaque brains to produce retinotopic maps of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extrastriate cortical visual area V5/MT based on their topographic connections with the previously established functional retinotopic map of primary visual cortex (V1). We also replicated the differential connectivity of magnocellular and parvocellular LGN compartments with V1 across visual field positions. Predicted topographic maps based on dMRI data largely matched the established retinotopy of both LGN and V5/MT. Furthermore, tractography based on in vivo dMRI data from the same macaque brains acquired at standard field strength (3T) yielded comparable topographic maps in many cases. We conclude that tractography based on dMRI is sensitive enough to reveal the intrinsic organization of ordered connections between topographically organized neural structures and their resultant functional organization.","LGN, macaque, pathways, retinotopy, visual cortex",

Attempts were made to trace- nigral efferent projections in the monkey by autoradiographic technics. Tritiated amino acids (L-leucine, L-lysine and L-proline), injected into portions of the substantia nigra (SN), labeled cells in four regions, designated as, (1) rostrolateral, (2) caudolateral, (3) rostromedial and (4) central. Rostrolateral nigral neurons transported radioactive label preferentially and abundantly to thalamic nuclei; localized isotope was found in parts of three thalamic nuclei, the medial part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLm), the magnocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VAmc), and the paralaminar part of the dorsomedial nucleus (DMpl). Lateral neurons in the caudal half of the SN transmitted radioactive label to the same thalamic nuclei as rostrolateral nigral neurons. Isotope transported to portions of the striatum was modest and localized. Radioactive label taken up by large cells in the caudal third of the SN was transported to portions of the striatum, but not to thalamic nuclei. Labeled nigral neurons in the medial two-thirds of the rostral half of the SN, and in the middle third of the central part of the SN, transported the label mainly to parts of the caudate nucleus and putamen. In these animals modest radioactive label was seen in VLm and VAmc, but not in other thalamic nucleus. There was no evidence that nigral neurons project to the subthalamic nucleus. No radioactive transport from nigral neurons was detected in the superior colliculus, the midbrain tegmentum, or the red nucleus, and none was transported to more caudal brain stem nuclei. Nigrothalamic fibers arise particularly from cells in rostral and lateral parts of the substantia nigra. While some cells in other parts of the nigra project to thalamic nuclei, these appear scattered and less numerous. Large cells in caudal parts of the SN do not project to thalamic nuclei. These observations confirm nigrothalamic projections to VLm and VAmc, and identify a new nigral projection to part of the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus (DMp1). No nigral efferent fibers project to any of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei.",,

Single neurons were recorded in these regions from awake, trained rhesus monkeys, and we correlated the discharge patterns of the cells with eye movements. About 60% of the neurons discharged after saccadic eye movements in an illuminated environment and had either excitatory, inhibitory, or biphasic (inhibitory-excitatory) response patterns. These responses were most often transient in nature. Neurons with excitatory activity had a mean onset latency of 72 ms after the termination of the eye movement. Latencies for cells with inhibitory responses averaged 58 ms. In sharp contrast, the cells with biphasic response patterns became active before the termination of the eye movement. A unique set of these neurons termed saccade cells, were active with visually guided eye movements in the light, with the same eye movements made to a briefly pulsed target in the dark, and for similar eye movements made spontaneously in total darkness. The activity was present with the appropriate saccade, independent of the beginning eye position. Biphasic response patterns were typical of these saccade cells. Saccade cells were most common in Pdm and PI. About half of the saccade cells also had some visual response that was independent of eye movement. A second group of cells was active with saccadic eye movements in the light but not in the dark. Some of these cells had clear visual responses that could account for their activity following eye movements; others had no clear visual receptive field. Because of these and other physiological data, we propose that the saccade cells found in Pdm may function in a system dealing with visual spatial attention, while those found in PI may have a role in dealing with the visual consequences of eye movements.",,

The present work relates recent experimental studies of the temporal coding of visual stimuli (McClurkin, Optican, Richmond, and Gawne, Science 253: 675, 1991) to the measurements of the spatiotemporal receptive fields of neurons within the lateral geniculate of primate. 2. We analyze both new and previously described magnocellular and parvocellular single units. The spatiotemporal impulse response function of the unit, defined as the time-resolved average firing rate in response to a weak stimulus flashed at a given location and time, is characterized by the singular value decomposition. This analysis allows one to represent the impulse response by a small number, two to three, of spatial and temporal modes. Both magnocellular and parvocellular units are weakly nonseparable, with major and minor modes that account, respectively, for approximately 78 and 22% of the response. The major temporal mode for both types is essentially identical for the first 100 ms. At later times the response of magnocellular units changes sign and decays slowly, whereas the response of parvocellular units decays relatively rapidly. 3. The spatiotemporal impulse response function completely determines the response of a unit to an arbitrary stimulus when linear response theory is valid. Using the measured impulse response, combined with a rectifying neuronal input-output relation, we calculate the responses to a complete set of spatial luminance patterns constructed of ""Walsh"" functions. Our predicted temporal responses are in qualitative agreement with those reported for parvocellular units (McClurkin, Optican, Richmond, and Gawne, J. Neurophysiol. 66: 794, 1991). Under the additional assumptions of Poisson statistics for the probability of spiking and a plausible background firing rate, we predict the performance of a unit in the Walsh pattern discrimination task as quantified by mutual information. Our prediction is again consistent with the reported results. 4. Last, we consider the issue of temporal coding within linear response. For stimuli presented for fixed time intervals, the singular value decomposition provides a natural relation between the temporal modes of the neuronal response and the spatial pattern of the stimulus. Although it is tempting to interpret each temporal mode as an independent channel that encodes orthogonal features of the stimulus, successively higher order modes are increasingly unreliable and do not significantly increase the discrimination capabilities of the unit.",,

We have used EM-autoradiography to determine the morphology of terminals in the inferior and lateral pulvinar which originate from neurons in visual cortex. After injections of H3 proline into area 17, both the small diameter (RS) and the large diameter (RL) terminals containing round vesicles and making asymmetric contacts are labeled in the two pulvinar subdivisions. Labeled and unlabeled terminals are intermixed within the pulvinar focus which suggests that the dendrites of the same pulvinar neuron receive overlapping inputs from several cortical areas. Because only 5% of the pulvinar terminals are RLs (Ogren and Hendrickson, '79), and this small number of RLs originates from at least two visual cortical areas plus the superior colliculus (Partlow et al., '77), superior colliculus input to inferior pulvinar is small compared to the combined RS and RL cortical input. Together the findings from this study and the preceding paper (Ogren and Hendrickson, '79), show that while pulvinar is typical of other thalamic nuclei in the structure of its neurons and synapses, it differs in that the input from subcortical structures is minimal. It is suggested that inferior and lateral pulvinar function principally as integrators of visual cortical information.",,

Ischemia was produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Its development was followed for weeks in the unanesthetized monkey. SEPs in VPL and cortex were shown to be useful indicators of neuronal activity in the course of brain ischemia. The most reliable parameters were found to be the amplitude of components P10, P12 and P20 of the cortical SEP, generated around the central sulcus. The relationship between the changes in spontaneous recovery of the SEPs, 1CBF and behavioral signs, in the course of time, revealed characteristic patterns. Different components of the cortical SEP provide useful information on the localization of the ischemic cortical area. In addition, the amplitude of the VPL SEP may also change significantly after the occlusion of the MCA. Clear evidence for the phenomenon of diaschisis in terms of SEPs, was found in only one animal. An analysis of the relationship between 1CBF and the amplitude of the SEPs showed that cortical SEPs could be measured at local CBF levels as low as 15 ml/100 g · min.

Lumbosacral spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons can be inhibited by noxious pinch of the contralateral hindlimb or either forelimb and by electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic, splanchnic, and hypogastric afferents. A previous study found that spinal transections between C2 and C4 sometimes abolished the inhibitory effect of spinal afferent input and sometimes left it intact. This suggested that propriospinal neurons in the C1 and C2 segments might mediate this effect. To test whether neurons in the C1 and C2 segments were involved in producing this inhibitory effect, the magnitude of the reduction in neural activity was measured in the same STT neuron before and after spinal transection at C1 or between C3 and C7. 2. All neurons were antidromically activated from the contralateral thalamus and thoracic spinal cord. For us to accept a neuron for analysis, the characteristics of the somatic input and the latency and shape of the antidromatic spike produced by spinal cord stimulation had to be the same before and after the spinal transection. Also, spinal transection often causes a marked increase in spontaneous cell activity, which may affect the magnitude of an inhibitory response. To avoid this confounding problem, a cell was accepted for analysis only if it showed marked inhibition of high cell activity evoked by somatic pinch before spinal transection. For analysis 13 STT neurons met these criteria: 6 neurons were in monkeys with C1 transections, and 7 neurons were in animals with transections between C3 and C7.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,

In this study, we used electron microscopy to assess potential structural changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic microcircuits in the VApc and CM of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. The intensity of immunostaining for GABAergic markers in VApc and CM did not differ between control and parkinsonian monkeys. In the electron microscope, three major types of terminals were identified in both nuclei: (1) vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)-positive terminals forming asymmetric synapses (type As), which originate from the cerebral cortex, (2) GABAergic terminals forming single symmetric synapses (type S1), which likely arise from the reticular nucleus and GABAergic interneurons, and (3) GABAergic terminals forming multiple symmetric synapses (type S2), which originate from GPi. The density of As terminals outnumbered that of S1 and S2 terminals in VApc and CM of control and parkinsonian animals. No significant change was found in the abundance and synaptic connectivity of S1 and S2 terminals in VApc or CM of MPTP-treated monkeys, while the prevalence of “As” terminals in VApc of parkinsonian monkeys was 51.4% lower than in controls. The cross-sectional area of vGluT1-positive boutons in both VApc and CM of parkinsonian monkeys was significantly larger than in controls, but their pattern of innervation of thalamic cells was not altered. Our findings suggest that the corticothalamic system undergoes significant synaptic remodeling in the parkinsonian state.","Pallidothalamic, corticothalamic, primate, centromedian nucleus, ventral anterior nucleus, parkinsonism, RRDIs: AB_2814814, AB_2278725, AB_2254256, AB_221569, AB_2814813, AB_477652, AB_2201528",

Hypothalamie lesions identical to those described elsewhere in MSG-treated rodents were identified by light microscopy and verified with the electron microscope in each infant monkey given MSG. No cellular pathology was detected in the hypothalami of NaCl-treated controls. Infants given relatively low oral doses of MSG (1 and 2 g/kg) sustained small focal lesions confined primarily to the rostro-ventral aspect of the infundibular nucleus. Those treated with high subcutaneous doses developed lesions which spread throughout and sometimes beyond the infundibular nucleus. At all doses tested (1–4 g/kg) and by either route of administration, rapid necrosis of neurons (within 5 hours) was a striking feature of the MSG-induced reaction pattern. Blood glutamate curves from time of treatment to time of sacrifice (5 hours) suggest that the threshold for lesion formation in 1-week-old rhesus monkeys may be in the range of 20 mg%. Differences in research approach which might account for the failure of others to locate the lesions we describe are discussed as are some of the toxicological implications of our findings.",,

One pathway by which eye position signals could be relayed to and across cortical areas is via the dorsal pulvinar. Several studies have demonstrated saccade-related activity in the dorsal pulvinar, and we have recently shown that many neurons exhibit postsaccadic spatial preference. In addition, dorsal pulvinar lesions lead to gaze-holding deficits expressed as nystagmus or ipsilesional gaze bias, prompting us to investigate the effects of eye position. We tested three starting eye positions (−15°, 0°, 15°) in monkeys performing a visually cued memory saccade task. We found two main types of gaze dependence. First, ~50% of neurons showed dependence on static gaze direction during initial and postsaccadic fixation, and might be signaling the position of the eyes in the orbit or coding foveal targets in a head/body/world-centered reference frame. The population-derived eye position signal lagged behind the saccade. Second, many neurons showed a combination of eye-centered and gaze-dependent modulation of visual, memory, and saccadic responses to a peripheral target. A small subset showed effects consistent with eye position-dependent gain modulation. Analysis of reference frames across task epochs from visual cue to postsaccadic fixation indicated a transition from predominantly eye-centered encoding to representation of final gaze or foveated locations in nonretinocentric coordinates. These results show that dorsal pulvinar neurons carry information about eye position, which could contribute to steady gaze during postural changes and to reference frame transformations for visually guided eye and limb movements. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Work on the pulvinar focused on eye-centered visuospatial representations, but position of the eyes in the orbit is also an important factor that needs to be taken into account during spatial orienting and goal-directed reaching. We show that dorsal pulvinar neurons are influenced by eye position. Gaze direction modulated ongoing firing during stable fixation, as well as visual and saccade responses to peripheral targets, suggesting involvement of the dorsal pulvinar in spatial coordinate transformations.",,

The specific thalamic afferents from the dorsolateral segment of the medial pulvinar and the lateral segment of the inferior pulvinar were topographically organized. A band of cells was labelled in the intralaminar nuclei (nucl. centr. med. and lat., reaching into LD and the most dorsal part of VL), and a few cells in the interlaminar layers of the lateral geniculate body. Other diencephalic afferents included the claustrum, the nucleus basalis Meynert and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. Ipsilateral cortical areas which projected into V4 included area 18 (V2), the inferior parietal cortex, the anterior and posterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus, the frontal eye fields and the temporo-basal association cortex on the lateral half of the parahippocampal gyrus and around the occipito-temporal sulcus. In the contralateral cortex, discontinuous regions in areas V4 and V5 on the prelunate gyrus and some cells at the 17/18-border were labelled. All regions in which labelled cells were found and, in addition a restricted region in the dorsal cap of the head and the tail of the caudate nucleus showed fibre and terminal labelling. In addition mesencephalic afferents and efferents were identified but not investigated in detail. An attempt to estimate the quantitative contribution of the various afferent systems to the prelunate cortex was made by counting the labelled cells in the different areas. The afferent and efferent organization of the prelunate visual association area indicates that it is incorporated in a network of cortical and subcortical regions involved in various aspects of visual behavior.",,

The response characteristics of neurons at these successive visual processing levels were examined with isoluminant gratings, cone-isolating gratings, and luminance-varying gratings. The main findings were: (i) Whereas almost all parvo- and konio-cellular LGN cells are of just two opponent-cell types, either differencing the L and M cones (Lo and Mo cells), or the S vs. L + M cones (So cells), relatively few striate cortex simple cells show chromatic responses along these two cardinal LGN axes. Rather, most are shifted away from these LGN chromatic axes as a result of combining the outputs (or the transformed outputs) of So with those of Lo and/or Mo cells. (ii) LGN cells on average process color information linearly, exhibiting sinusoidal changes in firing rate to isoluminant stimuli that vary sinusoidally in cone contrast as a function of color angle. Some striate cortex simple cells also give linear responses, but most show an expansive response nonlinearity, resulting in narrower chromatic tuning on average at this level. (iii) There are many more +So than −So LGN cells, but at the striate cortex level −So input to simple cells is as common as +So input. (iv) Overall, the contribution of the S-opponent path is doubled at the level of the striate cortex, relative to that at the LGN.",,

Three separate groups of neurons, monosynaptically activated by the ascending group I afferents, have been identified by systematic recording from the dorsal column nuclei and the rostral cervical cord. The second order neurons of the group I pathway to the cerebral cortex have been identified as cuneothalamic relay cells by antidromic stimulation of the medial lemniscus.

To investigate the possibility that some amino acids and certain dipeptides, such as N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), fulfill this function, changes in their concentration were measured in the optic tract, and the parvocellular and magnocellular segments of the LGNd of six monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), seven days after right optic tractotomy. The LGNd was studied also in two additional macaques, three months after occipital lobectomy. Tissue was frozen within five minutes of death, regions were dissected with the micropunch technique, and substances were analyzed by HPLC. Optic tractotomy induced significant, large reductions in NAAG, glutamate and aspartate in the optic tract distal to the lesion. Significant decreases in NAAG were also measured in the LGNd, and these changes were apparent in both the parvocellular and magnocellular segments. A small reduction in glutamate reached significance in the parvocellular laminae, and that of aspartate only approached significance in the magnocellular division. Occipital lobectomy produced large declines in aspartate and glutamate in the LGNd. The results of optic tractotomy support the role of NAAG as a neurotransmitter candidate in the monkey retinogeniculate pathways; its significant decrease in both geniculate segments suggests that both P- and M- retinal axons utilize this substance. Although at times the reductions in glutamate or aspartate failed to reach significance, their role cannot be excluded. The findings after occipital lobectomy strongly favor these latter substances as corticogeniculate and/or geniculocortical transmitters.",,

The inflow of somatosensory information to the cerebral cortex is regulated and mostly suppressed by movement, which is commonly referred to as sensory gating or gating. Sensory gating plays an important role in preventing redundant information from reaching the cortex, which should be considered when designing somatosensory neuroprosthetics. Gating can occur at several levels within the sensorimotor pathway, while the underlying mechanism is not yet fully understood. The average sensory evoked potential is commonly used to assess sensory information processing, however the assumption of a stereotyped response to each stimulus is still an open question. Event related spectral perturbation (ERSP), which is the power spectrum after time-frequency decomposition on single trial evoked potentials (total power), could overcome this limitation of averaging and provide additional information for understanding the underlying mechanism. To this aim, neural activities in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primary motor cortex (M1), and ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of thalamus were recorded simultaneously in two areas (S1 and M1 or S1 and VPL) during passive arm movement and rest in awake monkeys. Our results showed that neural activity at different recording areas demonstrated specific and unique response frequency characteristics. Tactile input induced early high frequency responses followed by low frequency oscillations within sensorimotor circuits, and passive movement suppressed these oscillations either in a phase-locked or non-phase-locked manner. Sensory gating by movement was non-phase-locked in M1, and complex in sensory areas. VPL showed gating of non-phase-locked at gamma band and mix of phase-locked and non-phase-locked at low frequency, while S1 showed gating of phase-locked and non-phase-locked at gamma band and an early phase-locked elevation followed by non-phase-locked gating at low frequency. Granger causality (GC) analysis showed bidirectional coupling between VPL and S1, while GC between M1 and S1 was not responsive to tactile input. Thus, these results suggest that tactile input is dominantly transmitted along the ascending direction from VPL to S1, and the sensory input is suppressed during movement through a bottom-up strategy within the gamma-band during passive movement.","somatosensory cortex, thalamus, sensory gating, time-frequency representation, Granger causality",

Recent behavioral evidence suggests that primates are also able to discriminate the level of threat posed by snakes, by responding more intensely to a snake model poised to strike than to snake models in coiled or sinusoidal postures (Etting and Isbell 2014). In the present study, we examine the potential for an underlying neurological basis for this ability. Previous research indicated that the pulvinar is highly sensitive to snake images. We thus recorded pulvinar neurons in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) while they viewed photos of snakes in striking and non-striking postures in a delayed non-matching to sample (DNMS) task. Of 821 neurons recorded, 78 visually responsive neurons were tested with the all snake images. We found that pulvinar neurons in the medial and dorsolateral pulvinar responded more strongly to snakes in threat displays poised to strike than snakes in non-threat-displaying postures with no significant difference in response latencies. A multidimensional scaling analysis of the 78 visually responsive neurons indicated that threat-displaying and non-threat-displaying snakes were separated into two different clusters in the first epoch of 50 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting bottom-up visual information processing. These results indicate that pulvinar neurons in primates discriminate between poised to strike from those in non-threat-displaying postures. This neuronal ability likely facilitates behavioral discrimination and has clear adaptive value. Our results are thus consistent with the Snake Detection Theory, which posits that snakes were instrumental in the evolution of primate visual systems.",,

A portion of the magnocellular pathway was permanently and selectively interrupted by ibotenic acid injections in the LGN of macaque monkeys. We then tested contrast sensitivity for detecting moving stimuli, as well as two indices of motion perception, contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination and speed difference thresholds, in the affected portion of the visual field. Magnocellular lesions greatly reduced detection contrast sensitivity at high temporal and low spatial frequencies and had a similar effect on contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination under these same stimulus conditions. Consequently, opposite direction discriminations could be made at contrast threshold, suggesting that magnocellular lesions reduced the visibility of stimuli used to test direction perception, but did not act directly on direction perception. Magnocellular lesions also elevated speed difference thresholds under some stimulus conditions. However, this deficit was reduced or eliminated by raising the contrast of the test stimulus. Together, these findings suggest that magnocellular lesions reduce the visibility of stimuli used to test motion perception but that they do not appear to alter motion perception otherwise.",,

It has been suggested that this segregation persists through to the highest stages of the visual cortex, and that the pronounced differences between the neuronal response properties in the parietal cortex and inferotemporal cortex may be attributed to differential contributions from magnocellular and parvocellular signals. We have examined this hypothesis directly by recording the responses of cortical neurons while selectively blocking responses in the magnocellular or parvocellular layers of the LGN. Responses were recorded from single units or multiunit clusters in the middle temporal visual area (MT), which is part of the pathway leading to parietal cortex and thought to receive primarily magnocellular inputs. Responses in the MT were consistently reduced when the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN was inactivated. The reduction was almost always pronounced and often complete. In contrast, parvocellular block rarely produced striking changes in MT responses and typically had very little effect. Nevertheless, unequivocal parvocellular contributions could be demonstrated for a minority of MT responses. At a few MT sites, responses were recorded while magnocellular and parvocellular blocks were made simultaneously. Responses were essentially eliminated for all these paired blocks. These results provide direct evidence for segregation of magnocellular and parvocellular contributions in the extrastriate visual cortex and support the suggestion that these signals remain largely segregated through the highest levels of cortical processing.",,

(1) that a circumscript posterolateral region of the monkey's orbitofrontal cortex has the functional significance of a higher-order olfactory association cortex
(2) that olfactory information is conveyed to this cortical region over a conduction route that by-passes the thalamus.
The present paper reports an attempt to identify sources of afferents to the above region that conceivably could function as links in such a specific olfacto-frontal conduction route. The attempt was made by comparing the patterns of retrograde cell-labelling resulting from horseradish peroxidase injections confined to, respectively, the lateroposterior quadrant of the orbitofrontal cortex and a more anterior orbitofrontal region with each other and with published reports of similar studies involving the frontal convexity. Both orbitofrontal injections labelled numerous cells in the medial subdivision of the nucleus mediodorsalis, and lesser numbers of cells in the nucleus ventralis anterior thalami, in the basal amygdaloid nuclei, substantia innominata, and temporal isocortex. Only in the case of injection in the lateroposterior quadrant of the orbitofrontal cortex did a considerable number of additional labelled cells appear in the medial bank of the rhinal sulcus (prorhinal cortex of Van Hoesen and Pandya).

PV immunoreactivity is reduced by enucleation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and by enucleation and visual deprivation in the striate cortex of adult monkeys. The effects of enucleation and visual deprivation on CaBP immunoreactivity in the LGN are not known. We therefore have studied cells and neuropil in the LGN that are labeled by antibodies to CaBP in normal and visually deprived Rhesus monkeys to determine if there is an effect on this calcium-binding protein. One group of monkeys had one eye removed 2 weeks to 4.3 years before sacrifice. A second group had one eye occluded with opaque lenses from infancy without enucleation. A final group had one eye occluded long-term followed by short-term enucleation 2 weeks before sacrifice. In normal monkeys, CaBP-immunoreactive neurons were found throughout the LGN. They were sparsely distributed within the six main laminae, and more densely distributed within layer S and the interlaminar zones (ILZ). The labeled ILZ neurons had a distinct morphology, with fusiform somata and elaborate dendritic trees that were confined primarily to the ILZ. Most CaBP-labeled neurons in the main layers had dendrites that radiated in all directions from the soma. ILZ and main layer cells labeled by CaBP thus probably represent two different cell types. Monocular enucleation with or without occlusion produced a significant reduction in antibody labeling in the deafferented laminae. Field measures revealed an average 11.5% reduction in optical density in each deafferented lamina compared to its adjacent, nondeprived layer. The differences in field optical density between deprived and nondeprived layers were statistically significant. CaBP neurons were still visible, but the optical density of antibody labeling in these cells also was reduced. Occlusion without enucleation had no effect.

For all of these applications, quantitative assessments of the behavioral effects of DBS are crucial to determine whether the therapy is effective and, if so, how stimulation parameters can be optimized. Behavioral analyses for DBS are challenging because subject performance is typically assessed from only a small set of discrete measurements made on a discrete rating scale, the time course of DBS effects is unknown, and between-subject differences are often large. We demonstrate how Bayesian state-space methods can be used to characterize the relationship between DBS and behavior comparing our approach with logistic regression in two experiments: the effects of DBS on attention of a macaque monkey performing a reaction-time task, and the effects of DBS on motor behavior of a human patient in a minimally conscious state. The state-space analysis can assess the magnitude of DBS behavioral facilitation (positive or negative) at specific time points and has important implications for developing principled strategies to optimize DBS paradigms.","deep brain stimulation, state-space models, Bayesian estimation, behavior, model selection, logistic regression",

The experiments were done in anesthetized macaques (Macaca fascicularis). In some neurons, S-potentials were recorded together with the post-synaptic action potentials, and all effects seen in P-LGN-cells were present already in their retinal afferents indicating their retinal origine. The responsiveness of the cells for center stimuli of different wavelengths and during illumination of the receptive field center or the outer surround was determined. Continuous outer surround illumination alered maintained dicharge rate (MDR), sensitivity and gain of P-LGN and retinal ganglion cells in the same way and empirically not distinguishable from direct illumination of the receptive field. Responses to surround flashes showed the same dependence on spectral composition as those to center flashes. Adaptation and excitation caused by outer surround illumination (inner diameter 5°, outer diameter 20°) were, in the average, ten times weaker than those exerted by light of the same spectral composition shone directly into the receptive field. Surround effects decreased proportional to r-2. Excitation by outer surround flashes was reduced by adaptation of the receptive field center in the same manner as responses to center flashes. The findings indicate that outer surround light has a direct excitatory and adaptive effect on the excitatory or inhibitory cones feeding into the receptive field. This indicates that straylight from the surround into the center could be responsible for the adaptive and excitatory effects of surround illumination. The straylight fraction from the remote surround into the receptive field must be higher, however, than that estimated from the psychophysically determined point spread function. It comes closer to earlier direct straylight measurements in excised eyes, but may be enhanced by chromatic aberration. If a surround of excitatory colour is flashed simultaneously with an excitatory center stimulus, additivity of center and surround excitation is observed only at low center intensities, while at higher center intensities the gain for center excitation is reduced similar to adaptive gain control. This could be explained by lateral interaction through horizontal connections in the retina, which decays within seconds, while adaptation of the cones feeding into the receptive field center is fully effective only after about 3 s. Our findings therefore suggest a two stage model for surround effects, a fast one mediated through horizontal connections controlling the gain of receptorbipolar transmission and a slow one through adaptation by straylight and controlling receptor gain. The fast process is receptor unspecific, i.e. pooling activity from all receptor types, while the second one is receptor specific. During real seeing both processes are simultaneous and complement each other because of continuous eye movements. Perceptual darkness and colour induction by remote surrounds are consistent with this model, which can also be applied to colour constancy. WM-cells (Yellow-minus-blue) show peculiar properties during surround or center illumination with blue light, suggestng an opponent mechanism different from that of other P-LGN-cells.",,

Differentiation of pyramidal neurons situated in the infragranular strata of the cortical plate (prospective layers 5 and 6, which give rise to these efferent projections) was also examined in Golgi preparations prepared from specimens of corresponding embryonic ages. In autoradiographs of the E63 fetus, no radioactive label was seen in subcortical structures. In two specimens injected around E70, label was present in the prospective magnocellular layers of the LGN and within the immediately surrounding cell-poor zones. At these young fetal ages, the presence of topographic order in the corticogeniculate projection could not be determined due to the large size of the injection sites relative to the small cerebral vesicles. By E84 the portion of the prospective parvocellular layers adjacent to the white matter also contained label which was characteristically wedge-shaped and appropriately located with respect to the site of the cortical injection, suggesting that topographic order is established. In the oldest fetus (E95) label in the LGN assumed a configuration similar to that seen in the adult. The cortical projection also invades the SC and pulvinar around E70. In the SC, label was initially confined to the stratum opticum, but by E84 it extended into the superficial gray. Thus, all known classes of efferent pathways from the visual cortex to subcortical structures are present by the middle of the 165-day gestational period in rhesus monkey. The one-month period, E63–E97, during which these efferent visual connections are established is characterized by the considerable growth and increased complexity of the dendritic arborization of pyramidal cells in the infragranular cortical layers of area 17. Thus the development of visual cortical efferents occurs in rough synchrony with the genesis of the afferent pathway from the LGN (Rakic, '76a; '79) and with the onset of morphological differentiation of pyramidal neurons in the infragranular cortical layers.",,

We measured the amplitudes and phases of responses to stimulation by spatially uniform fields modulated sinusoidally about a white point in a three-dimensional color space, at a range of temporal frequencies between 1 and 25 Hz. Below about 4 Hz, temporal frequency had relatively little effect on chromatic tuning. At higher frequencies chromatic opponency was weakened in almost all cells. The complex interactions between temporal and chromatic properties are represented by a linear filter model that describes response amplitude and phase as a function of temporal frequency and direction in color space along which stimuli are modulated. The model stipulates the cone inputs to center and surround, their temporal properties, and the linear combination of center and surround signals. It predicts the amplitudes and phases of responses of P-cells, and the change of chromatic properties with temporal frequency. We used the model to investigate whether or not the chromatic signature of the surround in a red–green cell could be estimated from the change in the cell's chromatic properties with temporal frequency. Our findings could be equally well described by mixed cone surrounds as by pure cone surrounds, and we conclude that, with regard to temporal properties, there is no benefit to be gained by segregating cone classes in center and surround.",P-cells; Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); Macaque monkey; Chromatic properties; Temporal properties;,

The present study provides evidence that retinal ganglion cells in the macaque monkey embryo diverge into M and P subtypes soon after their last mitotic division and that optic axons project directly and selectively to either the M or P moieties of the developing lateral geniculate nucleus. Thus, initial M projections from the eyes overlap only in prospective layers 1 and 2, whereas initial P projections overlap within prospective layers 3–6. We suggest that the divergence of the M and P pathways requires developmental mechanisms different from those underlying competition-driven segregation of initially intermixed eye-specific domains in the primate visual system.","axon guidance, neuronal specificity, retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, macaque monkey",

We have shown previously that DBS of the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) is associated with improvements in parkinsonian motor signs; however, the mechanism of this effect is not known. In this study, we extend our findings on the effect of STN and GPi DBS on neuronal activity in the basal ganglia thalamic network to include GPe DBS using the MPTP monkey model. Stimulation parameters that improved bradykinesia were associated with changes in the pattern and mean discharge rate of neuronal activity in the GPi, STN, and the pallidal [ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) and ventralis anterior (VA)] and cerebellar [ventralis lateralis posterior pars oralis (VPLo)] receiving areas of the motor thalamus. Population post-stimulation time histograms revealed a complex pattern of stimulation-related inhibition and excitation for GPi and VA/VLo, with a more consistent pattern of inhibition in STN and excitation in VPLo. Mean discharge rate was reduced in GPi and STN and increased in VPLo. Effective GPe DBS also reduced bursting in STN and GPi. These data support the hypothesis that therapeutic DBS activates output from the stimulated structure and changes the temporal pattern of neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia thalamic network and provide further support for GPe as a potential therapeutic target for DBS in the treatment of PD.","deep brain stimulation, globus pallidus, monkey, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), parkinsonism",

Most of the profiles followed in serial sections lack morphologically defined synapses. The few synapses observed are asymmetric, some with subjunctional dense bodies.

Since the lesions typically invade a number of cytoarchitectonic areas, the diverse behavioral effects could be a consequence of damage to different functional systems. To determine whether visuospatial ability depends critically on a particular parieto-preoccipital sector — inferior parietal, lateral preoccipital, or medial parieto-preoccipital — or on a particular combination of them, monkeys with lesions of one, two, or all three of these sectors were tested both on the ‘landmark’ task, a visual distance discrimination, and, for comparison, on a visual pattern discrimination. Impairment was found only on the landmark task, and the severity of the impairment depended on the number of sectors included in the removal, completely independent of their locus. In an attempt to integrate these results with current neurobiological data, we propose that the parieto-preoccipital region consists of two subdivisions that are organized hierarchically for the mediation of spatial perception. The lower-order subdivision, composed largely of the modality-specific preoccipital area, dorsal OA, is postulated to serve visuospatial processes selectively. The higher-order subdivision, composed mainly of the polysensory parietal area, PG, is postulated to serve a supramodal spatial ability to which both the visual and tactual modalities contribute.",parieto-preoccipital cortex; visuospatial ability; supramodal spatial function; monkey;,

The activity of about one third of the cortical and MGB units was independent of the behaving status of the animal. In other units, the response to an auditory signal delivered during task-performance conditions as compared to the response recorded during non-performance periods was either augmented or attenuated. Furthermore, it was found that the spontaneous activity of most of the MGB and cortical units was continuously affected by either an excitatory or an inhibitory input, activated by the behavioral state. The temporal characteristics of behavioral modulation were studied by computing an amplification curve for all MGB units characterized by a ‘through stimulus excitation’ type of response. Analysis of these curves together with the behavioral effect on the spontaneous activity allows the suggestion of possible mechanisms by which the behavioral state of the monkey modulates the activity in the thalamocortical segment of the auditory system.",medial geniculate; auditory cortex; rhesus monkey; behavioral task; single unit recordings;,

Prior to surgery, the animals had been trained in the performance of a sustained attention (successive color discrimination) task, some for water reinforcement and others for shock avoidance. All monkeys had implanted electrodes to permit monitoring of EEG. The animals with thalamic lesions showed little or no impairment in various measures of task performance, whereas every animal with a brain stem lesion showed substantial deficits that were interpreted as impairment in attention, coupled with some motor impairment. The impairment in the monkeys with brain stem implants was associated with hypersynchronous, slow-wave bursts in the EEG, which tended to diminish over time in the two animals which showed substantial recovery. Convulsive activity was seen in one animal with a brain stem lesion, and this appeared to be associated with the extensive invasion of aluminum hydroxide cream into the ventricular system. The brain stem lesions were large and unilateral and in every case destroyed portions of the superior and inferior colliculi, lateral lemniscus, and reticular nuclei. The thalamic lesions produced bilateral damage to midline and medial thalamic structures, as well as large areas of patchy cell loss in surrounding regions.

Static properties of trigeminothalamic neurons in behaving monkeys were similar to those in anesthetized monkeys. Responses to passively presented mechanical and thermal stimuli, receptive-field properties, and conduction velocities did not differ in the awake and anesthetized states. For most wide dynamic range and nociceptive-specific trigeminothalamic neurons, there was a negative correlation between the magnitude of thermally evoked activity and behavioral latencies to discriminate 47 and 49 degrees C stimuli. Thus, both groups of neurons provide information that could be used by the monkey to discriminate noxious thermal stimuli. The magnitude of thermal responses of trigeminothalamic neurons was modulated by the behavioral significance of the stimulus. Behaviorally relevant thermal stimuli presented during the thermal discrimination task produced a greater neuronal response than equivalent irrelevant thermal stimuli presented between behavioral trials or presented while the monkey performed the visual detection task. Neurons whose activity is modulated by behavioral state are likely to be involved in discrimination of thermal stimuli, since the activity of these neurons correlates with the behavioral response to the stimuli and information from the modulated neurons is sent to the thalamus. Some trigeminothalamic neurons that exhibited somatosensory responses also responded to behaviorally relevant stimuli and events associated with trial initiation and receipt of reward in the behavioral tasks. Similar events outside a behavioral task evoked no neuronal responses. These task-related responses were similar to those described previously for medullary dorsal horn neurons not identified as to projection sites (14).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Lowering prefrontal temperature to 15–20 °C — measured subdurally — induced a profound and reversible deficit of DR performance and a concomitant alteration of firing in cells of the parvocellular portion of the nucleus medialis dorsalis (MDpc). Spontaneous firing frequency was diminished in most of the units affected, while a tendency to grouped, rhythmic discharge was generally accentuated. The normal firing patterns related to DR performance were modified by prefrontal cooling in 63% of the units examined in MDpc. Prefrontal cooling induced a disruption of the sustained elevations of discharge shown by certain types of units during the delay period of DR trials. Sustained activation was attenuated, abbreviated or converted into a paradoxical inhibition as a result of cooling. The effects of prefrontal cooling on behavior and on unit activity in medialis dorsalis are discussed in the context of what is known about input and output connections of the prefrontal cortex. It is apparent that cryogenic depression of this cortical region interferes with the normal neural processes that constitute the substrate of short-term memory function.",,

Single PCP injections (dose, 2.0 or 4.0 mg/kg IV) in monkeys produced a striking distortion in the amplitudes of major AEP components. This AEP distortion was manifested in superior temporal cortex (ST) by a complex pattern of amplitude reduction and enhancement, and was manifested in the medial geniculate body (MGB) by amplitude reduction. These effects persisted for 4 to 5 hours. Upon chronic administration (dose, 4.0 mg/kg IV daily), the effects of PCP on AEP components in ST were enhanced while little change was noted in its effect on AEP components in MGB. These results suggest that PCP administration in rhesus monkeys causes a significant disturbance of AEPs within central nervous system structures associated with auditory processing (i.e., ST and MGB), and that chronic PCP administration enhances its effects on AEPs predominantly in the primary auditory cortex while having little additional effects on AEPs from the subcortical auditory pathways.",PCP; Rhesus monkey; EEG; Auditory evoked potentials; Auditory cortex; Medial geniculate body; Chronic administration; Enhancement;,

The gaussian white noise (GWN) analysis method was used to describe the stimulus-response relationship. Two different methods were used to estimate sign and relative strength of the response contribution of each of the three known cone systems as a function of time. Both methods revealed that, in contrast to the wellknown variability in gain and sign, the time course of the cone-type contributions was remarkably stereotyped in all cells. Surround-mediated cone-type contributions appeared to have a consistently longer delay than centre-mediated inputs. Response contributions from different types of cone appeared to add linearly in LGN neurones. Apart from rectification, it was possible to predict the response of the same neurone to step-modulation of intensity at various wavelengths successfully with the first-order Wiener kernel. This demonstrates that the cells behaved linearly under our stimulus conditions, which justifies the use of the first-order kernel as a means to characterize the system we wished to study.",,

I. Electrophysiology,"In squirrel monkeys or macaques under barbiturate anesthesia one or a few electrical pulses applied to the mesencephalic reticular formation or pretectal area alters synaptic transmission through the lateral geniculate nucleus, as tested by magnitude of response in optic radiation to stimulation of optic tract. The effect begins within 5–10 msec after the start of the mesencephalic stimulation and is usually biphasic. Initial inhibition lasts for about 30 msec and is then replaced by facilitation which peaks around 70–120 msec and may endure as much as 1 sec. The major site of the effect is upon the lateral geniculate nucleus, and both magno- and parvocellular elements are involved. Only rarely does the mesencephalic stimulation directly alter excitability of striate cortex. In this respect, as well as in the strong facilitation of photically elicited responses, the effects in primates differ significantly from those in cats. Although the inhibition observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus meets criteria commonly believed to signify a presynaptic origin, several paradoxical facts (see Discussion) must be resolved before this interpretation can be secure. It is hypothesized that the observed effects arise primarily from intrusion into a system normally concerned with the acquisition of visual information by ocular saccades. Saccadic gating of transmission through the lateral geniculate nucleus would distinguish self-generated visual signals from similar, extrinsically initiated signals, and would thus constitute the “corollary discharge”.",,

The monkey SCN has a dense plexus of NPY-IR axons identical in location and appearance to that in rodents. As in other mammals, no NPY-IR neurons are found in the monkey SCN. In contrast, in the human SCN, the NPY-IR plexus is less dense than in the monkey and there are numerous NPY-IR neurons.

Tactile or auditory stimuli, or brief stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation has a pronounced facilitatory effect if the monkey is moderately inattentive. However, when the monkey is fully alert, the mesencephalic stimulation may produce no enhancement.

Homogeneous illuminated test fields, centered on the receptive field, were used. Responses to these stimuli deviated from what is expected for the grating stimuli used to study the contrast-sensitive mechanisms in the visual pathway. For test fields smaller than the center of the receptive field, both the excitatory and the inhibitory cone-opponent components were present in the response, and the sensitivity to both components increased with the same factor when the test field increased in size (area summation). For test field areas extending into the suppressive surround of the extraclassical receptive field, the excitatory and the inhibitory cone opponents were both suppressed, again by the same factor. This suppression of the cell’s responsiveness, as a function of test spot area, was described by a logarithmic function, and the spatial sensitivity of attenuation could therefore be described by a power function of radius. The logarithmic suppression was clear for parvocellular and koniocellular cells but was more prominent for magnocellular cells. The surround field suppression was also found for the prepotential inputs to LGN cells, indicating a retinal origin. The difference of Gaussian (DOG) model has been used successfully to describe the cells’ contrast behavior for grating stimuli. However, this model fails to describe the constant excitatory/inhibitory response balance needed to obtain color (hue) stability for light stimuli of different sizes but with the same Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity and luminance factor.

Several theories of hierarchical computation ascribe the bulk of the computational work of the cortex to looped FF-FB circuits between pairs of cortical areas. However, whether such corticocortical loops exist remains unclear. In higher mammals, individual FF-projection neurons send afferents almost exclusively to a single higher-level area. However, it is unclear whether FB-projection neurons show similar area-specificity, and whether they influence FF-projection neurons directly or indirectly. Using viral-mediated monosynaptic circuit tracing in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), we show that V1 neurons sending FF projections to area V2 receive monosynaptic FB inputs from V2, but not other V1-projecting areas. We also find monosynaptic FB-to-FB neuron contacts as a second motif of FB connectivity. Our results support the existence of FF-FB loops in primate cortex, and suggest that FB can rapidly and selectively influence the activity of incoming FF signals.",,

Retrograde transneuronal degeneration in optic nerve terminals appeared as early as 14 days but lacked a uniform pattern. In some terminals, mitochondrial changes and/or smooth membranous proliferation were common. In others, depletion of synaptic vesicles was more pronounced. Rarely, these terminals were seen to undergo bulbous enlargement and to contain stacks of neurofilaments. Lamellated osmiophilic profiles and dense bodies together with glycogen particles were often encountered in late stages of degeneration. This irregular pattern of degeneration contrasted with the uniform filamentous change that the terminals are known to undergo when the optic nerves are severed. The reason for the lack of a consistent and synchronous degenerative pattern was attributed, mainly, to the difference in rate and severity of axonal reaction in geniculate neurons. Six months after the occipital lobectomy, swollen nerve fibers larger than the largest normal fibers were present, both in the geniculate nucleus and in the optic nerves proper. They displayed diverse changes and contained complex structures. They were similar to the altered fibers described in certain toxic neuropathies. The pathomechanism of retrograde transneuronal degeneration in retinal fibers was not clear; however, the phenomenon of ‘dying-back’ was invoked to explain this type of degeneration.",,

Optic nerve fibers and retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled by iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into electrophysiologically defined positions of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). By gross anatomical observation, the optic nerve usually had one distinct bend, which flexed dorsally 3-4 mm from the eyeball, and occasionally another ventrally directed bend was found just behind the eyeball. In the optic nerve head, fibers from the various retinal areas were arranged in a wedge according to the fiber trajectory on the retinal surface. For about a 3 mm distance from the disc, fibers rapidly spread out radially. Subsequently, rather than scattering dorsoventrally, they progressed to the chiasm with a gradual increase in the degree of mediolateral (nasotemporal) scatter. The degree of the scatter was different depending on the retinal site from which the axons originated. Fibers from the peripheral retina spread out widely for a few millimeters behind the eyeball. Thereafter the scatter was rather limited until the chiasm. On the other hand, the scatter of fibers from the foveal and parafoveal areas progressed gradually through the nerve. The present study also suggests that the difference in scatter depends on the types of cells of origin. Fibers from large ganglion cells displayed more extensive scatter than fibers from medium-sized cells. In spite of the extensive scatter of fibers, two clear segregations were found; one was a dorsoventral segregation, which was displayed by both central and peripheral retinal fibers, and the other was a center-peripheral segregation in which the fibers from the nasal central (papillomacular) retina were located almost exclusively in the central part of the optic nerve surrounded by peripheral retinal fibers. However, the temporal central retinal fibers were located in the lateral periphery of the nerve, and they overlapped significantly with fibers from the temporal peripheral retina. Furthermore, a broad intermingling was found between nasal and temporal peripheral retinal fibers owing to their mediolateral scatter. Thus, the present findings based on more precise anatomical techniques indicate that the classical notion of the retinal quadrant topography in the monkey optic nerve probably is suspect. In addition, the “rotation” of the fiber arrangement was not demonstrated.",,

Cells were recorded from awake, trained monkeys, and visual responses were characterized immediately before and after the animals made saccadic eye movements. A significant proportion of the cells were more responsive to stimuli around the time of eye movements than they were at other intervals. Other cells had response reduction. For some neurons, the change in excitability was associated with orbital position and not the eye movement. For other cells the change was present with eye movements of similar amplitude and direction but with different starting and ending positions. Here it appears that the eye movement is the important parameter. Other cells had effects related to both eye position and eye movements. In all cells tested, the changes in excitability were present when the experiments were conducted in the dark as well as in the light. This suggests that the mechanism of the effect is related to the eye position or eye movement and not visual-visual interactions. For about half of the neurons with modulations, the response showed facilitation for stimuli presented in the most responsive region of the receptive field but not for those at the edge of the field. For the other cells there was facilitation throughout the field. Thus, a gradient of modulation in the receptive field may vary among cells. These experiments demonstrate modulations of visual responses in the pulvinar by eye movements. Such effects may be part of the visual-behavioral improvements at the end of eye movements and/or contribute to spatial constancy.",,

It is generally thought that response variability in the visual system increases at cortical levels, but the causes of the variability have not been identified. We have measured the response variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys. We recorded from 80 single cells distributed over all V1 layers and from 8 parvocellular cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. All cells were stimulated with a bar of near-optimal orientation, color, and dimensions while continuously monitoring the eye movements of fixation. To minimize the effects of eye movements, responses that occurred while the eye was relatively steady were selected for analysis. The impulses elicited by each stimulus presentation were counted, and the variance and coefficient of variation were computed. Both measures of response variability were much lower than reported previously for V1 cells of both alert and anesthetized monkeys. Our data show that fixational eye movements cause a large component of response variance in alert monkeys. Moreover, the reliability of V1 neurons is not obviously degraded compared with lateral geniculate nucleus cells. The high reliability of neurons in alert monkeys is consistent with expectations from conventional biophysical models, and it suggests that activity in a modest number of neurons may suffice to form a perceptual decision.","striate cortex, monkey, alert, single cells, response variability, vision",

Noncongruent representation of the two half-retinae,"The representations of the two half-retinae were examined in the monkey's optic tract. Intravitreal injections of tritiated amino acids were made to reveal the distributions of the crossed and uncrossed populations of optic axons, while localized implants of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into different regions of the optic tract in order to examine the distributions and morphological types of retrogradely labelled cells at corresponding loci in the two half-retinae. Crossed and uncrossed optic axons are intermingled throughout most of the optic tract, but uncrossed axons are very sparse or absent along both the deep and superficial extremes of the tract. Implants of HRP into the deeper regions of the tract demonstrate that the crossed and uncrossed optic axons of the Pβ retinal ganglion cells are slightly out of binocular registration, with the uncrossed map being shifted to a slightly superficial location relative to the crossed map. The optic axons for the remaining cell classes, revealed by implants of HRP into the superficial portion of the tract, are much more conspicuously out of binocular registration (in particular, the Pβ optic axons); but in their cases, the uncrossed optic axons are shifted to deeper locations relative to the crossed optic axons. Further evidence that these optic axon classes are markedly out of binocular registration comes from the two optic tracts of a bilaterally destriated monkey, in which most of the Pβ optic axons have undergone a transneuronal retrograde degeneration. Following a uni-ocular injection of tritiated amino acids, the distributions of the remaining crossed and uncrossed axonal labelling occupied different positions within the tract rather than being intermingled, with the uncrossed optic axons situated deep to the majority of crossed optic axons. These results demonstrate that the optic chiasm does not combine binocularly corresponding optic axons of similar type. They also demonstrate that noncongruent field defects should be a common consequence of damage to the optic tract in humans. If the fibre order in the mammalian optic tract arises as a consequence of the sequence of axonal addition during development, then differences in the relative times of genesis for nasal and temporal members of any cell class, and/or differences in the relative pathlengths between the eye and two optic tracts, may produce the fibre ordering described herein.",,

Micromolar changes in CA concentration were obtained by stimulation of the eye with nonspecific (strobe) or specific (oriented bars, radial gratings) stimuli. CA release depended on which eye was illuminated. Electrodes passed tangentially through the striate area recorded release following visual stimulation of one eye or the other in succession, and the shift in eye dominance occurred at about 500 microns intervals. The magnitude of CA release was highly correlated with the ocular dominance of neuronal activity measured with tungsten microelectrodes. Light-stimulated release was not recorded in monkey area V2, V4, or somatosensory area 1, but was recorded in cat V2, suggesting that the presence of LGN afferents is associated with CA release.

Recent psychophysical studies have suggested that this is due to a reduction in responsiveness of magnocellular (M), but not parvocellular (P), cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this and other phenomena of responsiveness during saccades, we recorded from geniculate neurons in the behaving monkey before, during, and after saccades. Specifically, we measured neuronal responses to a flashing, whole-field illumination. Contrary to the prediction, most M neurons showed pronounced enhancement of visual activity during saccades, whereas such responsiveness of parvocellular (P) neurons was not significantly affected by saccades. We also analyzed the extent to which saccades affected burst firing, which results from activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductance. We found that both M and P cells displayed a significant suppression of burst firing during saccades.

Interruption of the STN-internal pallidum (GPi) pathway is a new stereotactic target for Parkinson''s disease. We have studied the antiparkinsonian efficacy of STN lesions in MPTP-treated monkeys. Four rhesus monkeys were made parkinsonian by MPTP (i.v. 0.15 ± 1 mg/kg) administration over 3 months. Unilateral subthalamotomy (kainic acid) was performed by a standard stereotactic method. Severity was rated from 0 (normal) to V by fine manual motor tests. Three monkeys (seventy state III/IV) showed marked improvement in spontaneous activity, facial expression and manual dexterity bilaterally but significantly greater in the limb contralateral to the lesion. Mild hemichorea was present in 2 and hemiballism in one. L-Dopa treatment (50 mg b.i.d.) enhanced the hemidyskinesias moderately. The therapeutic effect has persisted for over 8 months postsurgery. Monkey No.4 (severity stage V) showed chorea in the lower limb contralateral to the lesion but no improvement and died a few days later. Subthalamotomy improves parkinsonism in moderately severe parkinsonian monkeys. Dyskinesia might be a persistent complication.","Subthalamotomy; Parkinson's disease; Parkinsonism, induced; MPTP; Monkey;",

First, the organization of chromatic inputs differs substantially: in S+ cells, S-cone signals were usually opposed by those of L- and M-cones; in S− cells, signals from L-cones were usually opposed to those of S- and M-cones. Second, to pure S-cone modulation, S+ cells are twice as sensitive as S− cells, but S− cells were much more susceptible to contrast adaptation. Third, in S− cells but not S+ cells, the spatial frequency resolution for achromatic modulation was often greater, the tuning curve and more bandpass, than that for S-cone modulation. Along the dimensions on which we measured, the properties of the S+ cells were relatively tightly clustered, suggesting a homogenous class. Although the chromatic properties of S− cells are heterogeneous, the distribution of their tuning along other stimulus dimensions does not suggest multiple subtypes.","vision, color, macaque, LGN, parallel pathways, S-cone, blue cone",

Almost all combinations are observed, namely, axodendritic, dendrodendritic, dendrosomatic and somatodendritic, the most frequent being the dendrodentritic synapses between the presynaptic dendrites characteristic of I-cells. Quantitative analysis of 5 samples, each consisting of 200 μm2 of net LGNd neuropil, shows that presynaptic membrane specializations present in I-cell axonal and dendritic elements amount to a mean of 3.73 μm or 8.16 % of the surface of such profiles. Only 61% of this extent is in contact with principal cells (P-cells), and an unexpectedly high 39% engages other I-cell elements. Approximately 18% of the neuropil is occupied by I-cell profiles. A tentative segregation of axonal and dendritic endings revealed the following significant mean differences: dendritic terminals are more numerous and larger; axonal profiles have more of their surface occupied by synaptic sites and each contact is longer. Findings suggest the existence of a network of interconnected interneurons which are presumably inhibitory in nature. Such an arrangement can provide a certain measure of anisotropic disinhibition which may be responsible for specific transformations occurring in the LGNd depending upon the size and velocity of the stimulus as well as of the degree of synchronicity of temporal patterns.",,

Patterns were correlated with linear or non-linear components of the stimulus pattern at various wavelengths. Resulting correlograms revealed the spatial and spectral structure of receptive fields; they showed peaks or troughs according to whether that wavelength was associated with an increase or decrease in cell firing. Spectral response curves as derived from linear correlograms were similar to those reported for monochromatic stimuli. Variability in responsiveness and crossover wavelengths was high between parvocellular layer (PCL) cells even of the same class. Spatial differences between excitatory and suppressive receptive field components, i.e. a centre-surround organisation, are not apparent in linear correlograms from PCL cells. In this respect, spectral response curves do not qualitatively change with stimulus size. Correlation in time and the derivation of impulse functions showed that, even in magnocellular layer (MCL) cells, responses to luminance steps are of mainly temporal origin and due to a transient component in the response. A description of cell responses based on linear processing accounted well for the response patterns obtained in our experiments. Of various non-linear interactions investigated, only some kind of non-linear spectral differentiation provided an improvement in the description of cell responses. This improvement, however, was only minor and not present in all cells.",,

Anatomical studies have shown that connections of PM are preferentially distributed to higher association areas, those of PL are biased toward the ventral visual pathway, and those of PI are biased with the dorsal visual pathway. To study functional connections of the pulvinar at mesoscale, we used a novel method called INS–fMRI (infrared neural stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging). This method permits studies and comparisons of multiple pulvinar networks within single animals. As previously revealed, stimulations of different sites in PL and PI produced topographically organized focal activations in visual areas V1, V2, and V3. In contrast, PM stimulation elicited little or diffuse response. The relative activations of areas V1, V2, V3A, V3d, V3v, V4, MT, and MST revealed that connections of PL are biased to ventral pathway areas, and those of PI are biased to dorsal areas. Different statistical values of activated blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses produced the same center of activation, indicating stability of connectivity; it also suggests possible dynamics of broad to focal responses from single stimulation sites. These results demonstrate that infrared neural stimulation-induced connectivity is largely consistent with previous anatomical connectivity studies, thereby demonstrating validity of our novel method. In addition, it suggests additional interpretations of functional connectivity to complement anatomical studies.",,"In Old World and New World primates, the pulvinar contains the three major divisions defined by histochemical staining: the medial pulvinar (PM), the lateral pulvinar (PL), and the inferior pulvinar (PI). Connections of PM are preferentially distributed to higher association areas including parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and prefrontal areas (Bridge et al., 2015; Froesel et al., 2021; Homman-Ludiye & Bourne, 2019; Kagan et al., 2021); those of PL and central lateral PI (PIcl) are biased toward the ventral visual pathway; and those of central medial (PIcm), medial (PIm), and posterior (PIp) PI are predominantly with the dorsal visual pathway (Gattass et al., 2014; Kaas & Lyon, 2007; Moore et al., 2018; Shipp, 2001; Ungerleider et al., 2014). However, cytoarchitecture and functional subdivisions of the pulvinar are complicated, and pulvinar connectivity patterns span many areas of the cortex, making systematic study challenging (Baldwin et al., 2017; Shipp, 2003). That is, there are many histochemically identified subdivisions as well as physiologically defined divisions, and their borders are not necessarily consistent with each other. Here, we introduce a functional way to map connections from the pulvinar, one which may complement traditional approaches. Previous studies using anatomical tracer injections have elucidated clear patterns of connectivity from the pulvinar, but injections are not always focal, making distinctions between connections from nearby sites difficult to elucidate. Typically, only a few tracers are used per animal, which limits the number of networks that can be directly examined and compared. Furthermore, traditional anatomical tracers do not reveal secondary connections, something better revealed by functional stimulation methods. In addition, understanding connection strength, which anatomically can be quantified, for example, by density of connections or number of boutons, could also be studied in a more dynamic fashion by examining different statistical levels of functional connectivity. To study functional networks from the pulvinar, we introduce a novel approach termed INS–fMRI (infrared neural stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging) (Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2019). This methodology is based on delivery of focal (submillimeter-scale) pulsed near-infrared light that leads to neuronal response and subsequent activation of connected sites in the brain that are then mapped in ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using parameters that are effective and nondamaging, whole brain functional networks activated by the stimulated site can be mapped at mesoscale in vivo. Stimulation sites can be immediately and accurately localized, and multiple sites can be stimulated within a single pulvinar and resulting networks compared. Our results serve to validate the methodology. We find that these resulting networks have strong similarities to known anatomical networks. There is consistency between our results and known topographic connectivity of PM, PL, and PI. The differential connectivity of ventral and dorsal pathways is also largely replicated. What is novel is that mapped functional networks are mesoscale in nature and are brain wide. Importantly, this method provides a means to compare multiple pulvinar networks within single animals. Note on terminology: To simplify terminology, we use “PL” to refer to PL and PIcl, and use “PI” to refer to PIp/PIm/PIcm (without PIcl). In addition, there are four topographic subdivisions of the pulvinar (P1–P4) based on visuotopic organization (Gattass et al., 2014; Ungerleider et al., 2014): P1, P2, and P4 fall within PL, and roughly P3 lies in PI, although there still exists controversy regarding topographic organization in the pulvinar (e.g., precise maps, number of maps [Liu et al., 2021])."

We determined the effects of lesions of the parietal lobe on the capacities of monkeys to detect and discriminate between mechanical sinusoids delivered to the hand. Tests of discrimination measured the capacity to discriminate between frequencies of flutter (24--36 Hz) and the capacity to make gross discriminations of frequency of flutter-vibration over the range of 10--50 Hz. 2. A unilateral removal of the parietal lobe impaired sensory capacities only on the contralateral hand; detection threshold was elevated, the capacity to discriminate between frequenceis of flutter was permanently lost, and the capacity to discriminate between and identify frequencies of 10--50 Hz was grossly impaired. No defects were found on the hand ipsilateral to the lesion. Detection thresholds, but not discrimination thresholds, decreased during postoperative testing, but in most cases did not recover to preoperative values. The impairments in frequency discrimination remained through the last day of postoperative testing. 3. A unilateral, subtotal parietal lesion that completely destroyed the primary and secondary somatic areas and Brodmann's area 5 resulted in the same sensory impairments as those produced by total removal of the parietal lobe. In most cases, detection threshold was elevated; flutter-frequency discrimination was lost, and the capacity to discriminate between frequencies of 10--50 Hz over the extended range of flutter and vibration was impaired. 4. The loss in discriminative capacity following lesions of the somatosensory cortex is interpreted as due to the absence of a cortical mechanism that determined differences in the temporal pattern of cyclically entrained activity in the somatic afferent pathway. This loss was dissociated from the remaining capacity, although impaired, to detect the presence of any neural activity in the afferent pathways or to determine gross differences in the frequency of mechanical sinusoids by a mechanism of coding by the labeled line.",,

Statistically significant relations to the direction, amplitude, and peak velocity of the movement were found in all structures studied predominantly during the movement but also during the reaction time. For movements in a particular direction, the discharge rate was frequently a linear function of the movement amplitude and/or peak velocity. The slopes of this relation differed for different cells and comprised both positive and negative values. STN differed from both GPe and GPi in that (a) a larger proportion of neurons in STN showed significant relations to the direction of movement and (b) the onset times of changes in neural activity related to movement occurred earlier in STN than in GPe or GPi. The results of these studies suggest that cells in GPe, GPi, and STN may be involved in the control of movement parameters. Loss of the basal ganglia output related to the amplitude or velocity of movement might account for the impairments of step movements observed in Parkinsonian patients. On the other hand, deranged or excessive output related to amplitude or velocity control might result in the excesses of movement observed in other disorders, such as chorea and hemiballismus. These studies also provide direct evidence that the STN exerts a specific influence on basal ganglia output related to the control of movement parameters.",,

The lens was surgically removed from one eye of 3 macaques during the first month of life. Quantitative histologic comparison between LGN laminae connected with the phakic and aphakic eye revealed reductions of cell sizes in the monocular and binocular LGN segments receiving input from the aphakic eye of a magnitude comparable to that obtained by the lid suture technique. Since the amount of light stimulating the retina through an aphakic pupil is not reduced, we conclude that light deprivation can be excluded as a cause for arrest of cell growth in the LGN.",,

All patients were followed for more than 1 year. Using a stereotactic method, we plotted the lesions in an atlas delineating the probable structure involved. Secondly, in 2 monkeys, using autoradiography, we traced the pathway from the amygdala to the dorsomedial nucleus, paying particular attention to the intrathalamic course of the amygdalothalamic projections. Our findings were (1) patients develop amnesia when infarctions are located anteriorly; (2) in patients with amnesia, the lesions can be small and strategically located, probably interfering with both hippocampal-related neural structures such as the mamillothalamic tract, and amygdala-related neural structures such as the ventroamygdalofugal pathway; and (3) a specific component of the latter is situated lateral but immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract in the monkey, enabling both structures to be damaged bilaterally by small mirror image lesions. The amnesia, is characterized by deficits in anterograde verbal and visual learning and in retrograde amnesia, but motor learning is preserved.

The mapping was performed by reverse correlation of a spike train of a neuron with pseudorandom, binary level stimuli (m-sequence grids). Black and white m-sequence grids were used to map the receptive field for luminance. The locations of receptive field center and surround were determined from this luminance map. To map the contribution of each cone class to the receptive field, we designed red–green or blue–yellow m-sequence grids to isolate the influence of that cone (long, middle, or short wavelength-sensitive: L, M, or S). Magnocellular neurons generally received synergistic input from L and M cones in both the center and the surround. A minority had cone-antagonistic (M–L) input to the surround. Red–green opponent parvocellular neurons received opponent cone input (L+M− or M+L−) that overlapped in space, as sampled by our stimulus grid, but that had somewhat different extents. For example, an L+ center parvocellular neuron would be L+/M− in both center and surround, but the L+ signal would be stronger in the center and the M− signal stronger in the surround. Accordingly, the luminance receptive field would be spatially antagonistic: on-center/off-surround. The space–time maps also characterized LGN dynamics. For example, magnocellular responses were transient, red–green parvocellular responses were more sustained, and blue-on responses were the most sustained for both luminance and cone-isolating stimuli. For all cell types the surround response peaked 8–10 msec later than the center response.","receptive field, primate, color, LGN, lateral geniculate, retina, dynamics, cone photoreceptor, m-sequence",

Lesioned areas included n. ventralis anterior (VA), ventralis lateralis (VL), n. ventralis posterolateralis pars oralis (VPLo), pars caudalis (VPLc) n. subthalamus (STN) and n. centrum medianum (CM). When the lesion included VA, VL, and VPLo, there was a cerebellar syndrome, i.e., ataxia and dysmetria. When the lesion included VPLo and VPLc, the animal was paralyzed. When the lesion included VPLo and rostral part of VPLc, there was loss of orientation in hand movement and clumsiness of finger manipulation. These motor deficits gradually disappeared within 1–2 weeks and the function recovered near to normal except for when VPLo and VPLc were totally destroyed. After recovery of motor function, the somatic sensory cortex (areas 1, 2, 3b) ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion was removed. Removal of the sensory cortex resulted in abolition of the recovered function, but when the border area between VPLo and VPLc was intact, the function recovered again. On the other hand, when the thalamic lesion included this border area, succeeding cortical lesion permanently abolished the recovered function or the reappeared function was substantially worse than that before the cortical lesion. Neuronal mechanisms subserving these differences are discussed and it is concluded that when direct sensory input to the motor cortex was interrupted by lesion of the border area between VPLo and VPLc, the lost function was compensated by reorganization of the projection from the sensory cortex to the motor cortex.",Thalamus; Nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL); Nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL); Sensory cortex; Motor deficit;,

In primates, the caudal intralaminar nuclei, centromedian and parafascicular (CM/PF), are an integral part of basal ganglia circuits and a main source of inputs to the striatum. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular and subsynaptic distribution of GABAB receptor subunits by using light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical techniques. Quantitative immunoperoxidase and immunogold analysis showed that both subunits display a similar pattern of distribution in CM/PF, being expressed largely at extrasynaptic and perisynaptic sites in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axon-like processes and less abundantly in axon terminals. Postsynaptic GABABR1 labeling was found mostly on the plasma membrane (70–80%), whereas GABABR2 was more evenly distributed between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments of CM/PF neurons. A few axon terminals forming symmetric and asymmetric synapses were also labeled for GABABR1 and GABABR2, but the bulk of presynaptic labeling was expressed in small axon-like processes. About 20% of presynaptic vesicle-containing dendrites of local circuit neurons displayed GABABR1/R2 immunoreactivity. Vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT1)-containing terminals forming asymmetric synapses expressed GABABR1 and/or displayed postsynaptic GABABR1 at the edges of their asymmetric specialization. Overall, these findings provide evidence for multiple sites where GABAB receptors could modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in the primate CM/PF complex. J. Comp. Neurol. 496:269–287, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmission is mediated by three distinct receptor subtypes, GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC, characterized by their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. GABAA and GABAC receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory postsynaptic currents by triggering the opening of integral chloride channels (Olsen and Tobin, 1990; Mcdonald and Olsen, 1994). GABAB receptors belong to the family of seven transmembrane domain receptors (Marshall et al., 1999) and are coupled to Ca2+ and K+ channels via G proteins and second messenger systems (Couve et al., 2000; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000; Billinton et al., 2001). Functional GABAB receptors were first identified on presynaptic terminals, where they act as auto- or heteroreceptors to influence transmitter release by suppressing Ca2+ conductance (Bowery, 1993; Bowery et al., 2002). Subsequent studies showed the existence of postsynaptic GABAB receptors whose activation produces an increase in membrane K+ conductance and associated neuronal hyperpolarization (for reviews see Bowery et al., 2002; Bettler et al., 2004; Cryan and Kaupmann, 2005). Thus, the synaptic release of GABA in a particular brain region can mediate distinct and complex electrophysiological effects depending on the relative abundance and distribution of the different subtypes of GABA receptors in relation to the release sites of transmitter. So far, two GABAB receptor subunits have been identified, GABAB receptor subunit 1 (GABABR1) and GABAB receptor subunit 2 (GABABR2), which assemble into heterodimers to form functional GABAB receptors (Bettler et al., 1998; Jones et al., 1998; Kaupmann et al., 1998; White et al., 1998; Kuner et al., 1999; Makoff, 1999; Martin et al., 1999; Bowery and Enna, 2000). The GABABR1 subunit is responsible for binding GABA, whereas GABABR2 is required for cell-surface expression (Bormann, 2000; Calver et al., 2001; Pagano et al., 2001) and G-protein coupling (Galvez et al., 2001; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2001a, b; Robbins et al., 2001; Havlickova et al., 2002) of GABAB receptors. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies revealed that GABABR1 and GABABR2 expression shows considerable overlap in many areas of the central nervous system (CNS; Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2000). GABAB receptor binding sites, GABAB receptor subtype mRNAs, and GABAB receptor protein are strongly expressed in the rat and monkey thalamus (Chu et al., 1990; Muñoz et al., 1998; Ambardekar et al., 1999; Bowery et al., 1999; Princivalle et al., 2000, 2001), but their exact location and function remain controversial. Electrophysiological evidence indicates that GABAB may act as pre- or postsynaptic receptors at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses in the rat and mouse thalamus (Banerjee and Snead, 1995; Ambardekar et al., 1999; Chen and Regehr, 2003). So far, a single electron microscopic analysis of the rat ventrobasal nucleus has examined the cellular and subcellular localization of GABAB receptor in the rat thalamus (Kulik et al., 2002). In primates, the intralaminar nuclei, centromedian (CM) and parafascicular (PF), are an integral part of basal ganglia circuits (Smith et al., 2004). This nuclear group is a major source of thalamic afferents to the striatum (Cowan and Powell, 1956; Parent and DeBellefeuille, 1983; Smith and Parent, 1986) and receives functionally segregated GABAergic inputs from basal ganglia output nuclei (Smith et al., 2004). Despite this substantial GABAergic innervation, very little is known about the location and function of GABAB receptors in the caudal intralaminar complex. To address this issue further, we undertook a detailed high-resolution electron microscopic study of the localization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits in the monkey CM/PF. Findings of this study have been presented in part in abstract form (Villalba and Smith, 2004).  asymmetric axon terminal preterminal axon-like centromedian thalamic nucleus dendrite extrasynaptic local circuit neuron nucleus puncta adherens-like contact perisynaptic parafasicular thalamic nucleus projection neuron symmetric synaptic vesicle-containing dendrite"

In the primary visual cortex the relative cell densities of the 2 systems change little with eccentricity. These calculations therefore predict a 20-fold change in the relative densities of the inputs to the visual cortex from the 2 subdivisions of the lateral geniculate body. To test this prediction, we asked if the following vary with eccentricity: (1) the ratio of the number of magnocellular to parvocellular neurons innervating a given area of striate cortex and (2) the relative density, in the magno- and parvo-recipient sublaminae of layer 4C, of radioactivity transported from the eye to the cortex. Neither of these ratios showed any significant variation with eccentricity. These results seem to throw doubt on the contention that the ratio between the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the number of cells per degree2 of visual field varies significantly with eccentricity.",,

An extensive complement of nonretinal inputs to the LGN combine to modulate the responsiveness of relay cells to their retinal inputs, and thus control the transfer of visual information to cortex. These inputs have been studied in the most detail in the cat. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the neurotransmitters used by nonretinal afferents to the monkey LGN are similar to those identified in the cat. By combining the retrograde transport of tracers injected into the monkey LGN with immunocytochemical labeling for choline acetyl transferase, brain nitric oxide synthase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, or the histochemical nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase reaction, we determined that the organization of neurotransmitter inputs to the monkey LGN is strikingly similar to the patterns occurring in the cat. In particular, we found that the monkey LGN receives a significant cholinergic/nitrergic projection from the pedunculopontine tegmentum, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus and pretectum, and a cholinergic projection from the parabigeminal nucleus. The major difference between the innervation of the LGN in the cat and the monkey is the absence of a noradrenergic projection to the monkey LGN. The segregation of the noradrenergic cells and cholinergic cells in the monkey brainstem also differs from the intermingled arrangement found in the cat brainstem. Our findings suggest that studies of basic mechanisms underlying the control of visual information flow through the LGN of the cat may relate directly to similar issues in primates, and ultimately, humans. J. Comp. Neurol. 424:701–717, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex. The LGN performs this function dynamically, as a consequence of complex interactions of the intrinsic membrane properties of the LGN cells with an extensive complement of nonretinal inputs to the LGN that arise from cortical and subcortical loci (for reviews see Sherman and Koch, 1986; Sherman and Guillery, 1996). Nonretinal inputs have been examined in the most detail in the cat. In this species, the retinal input to thalamocortical relay cells makes up only 5–10% of the total synapses, and the remaining inputs are made up of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs from interneurons, the thalamic reticular nucleus and the pretectum, glutamatergic inputs from cortex, histaminergic inputs from the hypothalamus, and cholinergic/nitrergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic inputs from the midbrain and pons (De Lima and Singer, 1987; Smith et al., 1988; Fitzpatrick et al., 1989; Montero, 1990; Uhlrich and Cucchiaro, 1992; Uhlrich et al., 1993; Bickford et al., 1993, Bickford et al., 1994, Bickford et al., 1999; Erişir et al., 1997, Erişir et al., 1998). These inputs combine to modulate the responsiveness of relay cells to their retinal inputs, and thus control the transfer of visual information to cortex. The monkey remains an important species for the study of the visual system, particularly at the cortical level, but we do not understand the microcircuitry of the monkey LGN to the same level of detail as we do for the cat (Wilson, 1993). Recently, the sources of subcortical input to the monkey LGN were identified and found to be nearly identical to those previously described in other species (Wilson et al., 1995). The goal of the present study was to determine whether the neurotransmitters used by these afferents are also similar to those identified in the cat. This information is important for determining how the organization of the LGN may vary across species, and thus to what extent the results of studies in the cat can be applied to the monkey and human."

This is thought to reflect the activity of a contrast gain control (“normalization”) that has very broad tuning on the relevant stimulus dimension. Contrast invariant tuning on a particular dimension is probably necessary for reliable representation of stimuli on that dimension. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), V1, and V2 of anesthetized macaque, we measured chromatic tuning of neurons at several contrasts to characterize the gain controls and identify cells that might be important for representing color. We estimated separately the chromatic signature of the linear receptive field and that of the gain control. In the LGN, we found normalization in magnocellular cells and cells receiving excitatory S-cone input but not in parvocellular cells or those receiving inhibitory S-cone input. We found normalization in all types of cortical neurons. Among cells that preferred achromatic modulation, or modulation along intermediate directions in color space (making them responsive to both achromatic and chromatic stimuli), normalization was driven by mechanisms tuned to a restricted range of directions in color space, close to achromatic. As a result, chromatic tuning varied with contrast. Among the relatively few cells that strongly preferred chromatic modulation, normalization was driven by mechanisms sensitive to modulation along all directions in color space, especially isoluminant. As a result, chromatic tuning changed little with contrast. To the extent that contrast invariant tuning is important in representing chromaticity, relatively few cortical neurons are involved.","vision, color, striate cortex, extrastriate, contrast, lateral geniculate",
