thalamus,The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis LR with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory LRM An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus comprising twelve levels is presented with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus Each level is described and compared

organization of projections of the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient nuclei of the pretectal complex and layers of the superior colliculus to the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar in the macaque monkey,The organization of five projections from the retinorecipient and non-retinorecipient layers of the superior colliculus SC and nuclei of the pre-tectum to the lateral pulvinar medial pulvinar and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus DLG of the thalamus in the macaque monkey were established by using both anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde horseradish perox-idase tracing techniques Some projections from these midbrain regions to the inferior pulvinar are also described as are projections to the thalamus from the tectorccipient parabigeminal nucleus First the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient pretectal nuclei and SC layers were determined by Nissl stains myelin stains and the distribution of label resulting from intraocular injections of tritiated amino acids The possible projections of these pre-tectal nuclei layers of the SC as well as the parabigeminal nucleus to the pulvinar and DLG were then determined by both horseradish peroxidase and autoradiographic tracing methods The retinal projections to the SC extend throughout layers II-l II- II- and dorsal III with obvious patches in layers II-l and II- as described before by others There were a number of pretectal nuclei which also had connections with the retina In the nomenclature adopted these include the sublentiform nucleus the nucleus of the optic tract not to be confused with the thalamic limitansnucleus the posterior orprincipal pretectalnucleus and the laminatedolivary nucleus with a head and tail The nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of the pretectal area do not receive retinal projections The retinorecipient midbrain regions which project to the pulvinar are as follows Aside from a complicated multifocal projection to the inferior pulvinar the superficial retinorecipient SC layers project to three terminal foci or zones in one or more of the lateral pulvinar subdivisions alpha beta and gamma Rezak and Benevento  Focus  lies mainly along the dorso-ventral lateral border of subdivisions of PL-gamma and PL-beta extending ventrally to PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- and III Focus  occu-pies the lateral  of PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- II- and III There is a topographical arrangement to the SC projections to foci  and  which may reflect a representation of more than two visual quadrants in the lateral pulvinar Focus  which consists of several clusters is located medially in PL-gamma and PL-beta and overlaps their mutual border with the medial pul-vinar Focus  is complicated as it is made up of a mixed input from the retinorecipient superficial and nonretinorecipient deep SC layers The portion of focus  located along the medial edge of the lateral pulvinar arises mainly from SC layers II- II- and III while the portion of the focus located along the adjacent lateral edge of the medial pulvinar arises mainly from SC layersIV V and VI These projections to the pulvinar from the superficial SC differ in their origins from those to the DLG which arise mainly from smaller cells in SC sublayer II- The nonretinorecipient SC projections to the pulvinar arise mainly from the deep layers ie IV V and VI and end in focus  within the medial pulvinar and the caudal oral pulvinar The projection from the deep SC layer to the medial half of focus  in the medial pulvinar has already been described above A pretectal projection to the lateral pulvinar from the retinorecipient region consisting of the nucleus of the optic tract the sublentiform nucleus and the posterior pretectal nucleus collectively called SL in our previous study Benevento et al b was confirmed This projection forms a focus focus  in the dorsal shoulder of the rostral lateral pulvinar which extends over foci  and  Our HRP data indicate that these pretectal nuclei might have convergent projections with the SC to foci  to  and the DLG How- ever because of the problem of interruption of fibers of passage this inter- pretation of convergent projections should be viewed with caution The HRP studies also indicate that the parabigeminal nucleus which is inter- connected with the SC projects to the thalamus as it contained a modest number of labelled cells after injections of the inferior pulvinar and focus  in PL-alpha but only a sparse number after injections of the DLG and focus  These results suggest that direct retinal influences can be relayed to visually responsive association cortex via retino-tectal-lateral pulvinar retino-pretectal-lateral pulvinar and retino-tecto-parabigeminal-lateral pulvinar routes in addition to the retino-tectal-geniculate and retino-tectal-inferior pulvinar routes In addition visuomotor and polysensory information influences thalamocortical systems via projections from the deep layers of the SC to the medial pulvinar When these findings are compared with the known organization of pulvinocortical interconnections one can conclude that the cortex of all four neocortical lobes can be influenced rather directly by the midbrain The response properties of the various cortical visual areas thus need not depend solely upon the corticocortical projections,

afferent connections of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the rat, related to the mediodorsal-prefrontal topography",The aim of the present study was to determine the organization of the afferents of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in relation to the reciprocal connections of this nucleus with different areas of the prefrontal cortex For this purpose injections of horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin were placed in different parts of the mediodorsal nucleus These experiments revealed the organization of the reciprocal mediodorsal-prefrontal connections since wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase is transported effectively in anterograde and retrograde directions Injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tracers were placed in different portions of the prefrontal cortex and the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was injected in the mediodorsal nucleus in order to verify in more detail the point-to-point relationship in the mediodorsal-prefrontal connections The organization of a number of the subcortical afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus was determined in detail using injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or tritiated amino acids in areas identified as a source of mediodorsal afferents in the retrograde tracing experiments These anterograde tracers were injected in different parts of the pallidal complex the amygdala the lateral hypothalamus the lateral entorhinal cortex the ventral mesencephalon the superior colliculus and the dorsal tegmental region The results of the present experiments indicate that the mediodorsal nucleus on the basis of its cyto-myelo- and chemoarchitecture as well as the organization of its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex can be subdivided into a medial a central a lateral and a paralamellar segment Apart from this subdivision along a mediolateral axis rostrocaudal and dorsoventral differences are also evident in the structural organization and connectivity of the mediodorsal nucleus A number of subcortical structures send fibres to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus The reticular thalamic nucleus projects to the mediodorsal nucleus in a topographical way such that its rostral part is connected with the rostral part of the nucleus whereas more caudal and ventral areas in the reticular thalamic nucleus are connected with more caudal parts of the mediodorsal nucleus Regions in the brainstem that project to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus include the mesencephalic raphénuclei the locus coeruleus the rostral part of the central gray substance and the reticular formation The median raphénucleus projects most heavily to lateral parts of the mediodorsal nucleus whereas the dorsal raphénucleus is most strongly connected with its medial parts Besides these general inputs the different mediodorsal nuclear segments receive a specific input and have different relations with particular areas of the prefrontal cortex The rostral part of the medial segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the prelimbic and the ventral anterior cingulate areas and to a lesser degree with the medial orbital and the ventral agranular insular areas The posterior ventral part of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus has reciprocal fibre relations with the dorsal agranular insular area The most medial part of the nucleus immediately adjacent to the paraventricular nucleus receives fibres from the infralimbic area but appears not to reciprocate them The medial segment receives input from a large number of structures in the realm of the limbic system ie the amygdala the lateral entorhinal cortex the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area the supramammillary nuclei and from structures that are closely related to the basal ganglia system ie the ventral pallidum the ventral tegmental area and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra With an antibody against dopamine it was determined that both the paraventricular nucleus and the adjacent parts of the mediodorsal nucleus contain a plexus of dopaminergic fibres The most medial zone of the dorsal-medial thalamus which includes the paraventricular nucleus receives additional fibres from the nucleus accumbens the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis the dorsomedial hypothalamus the subiculum the parabrachial nuclei and the nucleus of the solitary tract The central segment of the mediodorsal nucleus differs from the medial segment in that it receives its most strong and specific input from olfactory related structures such as the deep layers of the prepiriform cortex and the ventral pallidal cells in the olfactory tubercle The central segment also receives afferents from the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area and the lateral hypothalamus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the ventral agranular insular and the lateral orbital areas The lateral segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives a small number of fibres from the medial portion of the globus pallidus and the lateral hypothalamus but its main inputs come from brainstem structures such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the dorsal anterior cingulate area The paralamellar segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives afferents from the deep layers of the superior colliculus the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus Additional inputs most probably come from pretectal nuclei the region of the cuneiform nucleus and the contralateral fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the medial precentral area of the frontal cortex an area that in the rat constitutes the frontal eye field These results indicate that in the rat via distinct segments of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus different parts of the prefrontal cortex can be influenced by a wide spectrum of structures that are mainly involved in the limbic circuitry or are part of the limbic-afferented basal ganglia An important observation is that the mediodorsal nucleus receives strong inputs from pallidal nigral and tectal areas which are the main waystations in the outflow of the basal ganglia This may imply a role for the mediodorsal nucleus in
