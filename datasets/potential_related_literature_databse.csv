primate motor thalamus,The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis LR with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory LRM An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus comprising twelve levels is presented with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces This produces a modified parcellation of the

To do so, we examined labelling in the thalamus of eight macaque monkeys which received injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B-subunit within TE. Four of these cases were infants in which the injections revealed transient patterns of inputs to TE from various other brain regions. Although each monkey showed extensive label in the pulvinar nucleus and other subcortical structures, none showed unambiguous labelling in the dLGN. The absence of direct connections between the dLGN and area TE indicates that rudimentary color and form processing capacities in the absence of striate cortex must utilize other pathways even when damage to striate cortex takes place early in life.",extrastriate cortex; inferior temporal cortex; monkey; blindsight; visual cortex; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PRESTRIATE CORTEX; MONKEY; PATHWAYS
