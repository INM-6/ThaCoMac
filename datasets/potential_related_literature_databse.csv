We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neuron's receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a “response vector” whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19–26%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 ± 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response.",,

Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay, and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain, detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information. To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control. Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation. The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia.",Dopamine; Thalamus; Monkey; Human; Primate; Dopamine transporter; Parkinson; Schizophrenia; Addiction;,

ML and STT axons were labeled by the anterograde axon transport of WGA-HRP following injection of the tracer into the contralateral dorsal column nuclei, or the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, respectively. Thalamic tissue was histochemically reacted for the presence of HRP. Serial thin sections were stained with a gold-labeled antibody to GABA, to determine which neuronal elements exhibited GABA immunoreactivity (GABA- ir). Serially sectioned thalamic structures were recorded in electron micrographs and reconstructed in three dimensions by computer. Individual ML axon terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with segments of the proximal dendritic trees of thalamocortical relay neurons and also synapse upon the dendritic appendages of GABA-ir interneurons (local circuit neurons). These GABA-ir dendritic appendages contain synaptic vesicles and are presynaptic (presynaptic dendrites) to the same segments of relay neuron dendrites that receive ML contacts. When analyzed in serial sections and reconstructed by computer, the ML terminals form triadic relationships (ML, GABA appendage, and relay neuron dendrite) or more complex glomerular arrangements involving multiple appendages, all of which then contact the relay neuron dendritic segment. In contrast, multiple STT terminals make synaptic contacts along segments of projection neuron dendrites and are usually the only type of profile to contact that segment of dendrite. More than 85% of the spinal afferents form simple axodendritic synapses with relay cells and do not contact GABA-ir appendages. The thalamic synaptic relationships of ML terminals are fundamentally different from those formed by the STT. Because STT neurons predominatly transmit information about noxious stimuli, the simple axodendritic circuitry of the majority of these spinal afferents suggests that the transmission of noxious information is probably not subject to GABAergic modulation by thalamic interneurons, in contrast to the GABAergic processing of non-noxious information carried by the ML afferents. The differences in the GABAergic circuits of the thalamus that mediate ML and STT afferent information are believed to underlie differential somatosensory processing in the forebrain. We suggest that changes in thalamic GABAergic dendritic appendages and GABA receptors following CNS injury may play a role in the genesis of some central pain states.",,

Our goal was to determine the proportion of labeled neurons contributing to this projection system by the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei, and to investigate the relationship of thalamic projections to specific architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex. We selected areas for study within both the basoventral (areas 11, 12, and ventral 46) and the mediodorsal (areas 32, 14, 46, and 8) prefrontal sectors. This choice was based on our previous studies, which indicate differences in cortical projections to these two distinct architectonic sectors (Barbas, '88; Barbas and Pandya, '89). In addition, for each sector we included areas with different architectonic profiles, which is also relevant to the connectional patterns of the prefrontal cortices. The results showed that MD included a clear majority (over 80%) of all thalamic neurons directed to some prefrontal cortices (areas 11, 46, and 8); it contributed just over half to some others (areas 12 and 32), and less than a third to area 14. Clusters of neurons directed to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal areas were largely segregated within MD: the former were found ventrally, the latter dorsally. However, the most striking findings establish a relationship between thalamic origin and laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. Most thalamic neurons directed to lateral prefrontal cortices, which are characterized by a high degree of laminar definition (areas 46 and 8), originated in the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions of MD, and only a few were found in other nuclei. In contrast, orbital and medial cortices, which have a low degree of laminar differentiation, were targeted by the magnocellular subdivision of MD and by numerous other limbic thalamic nuclei, including the midline and the anterior. Thus topographic specificity in the origin of thalamic projections increased as the laminar definition of the target area increased. Moreover, the rostrocaudal distribution of labeled neurons in MD and the medial pulvinar also differed depending on the degree of the laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. The rostral parts of MD and the medial pulvinar projected to the eulaminate lateral prefrontal cortices, whereas their caudal parts projected to orbital and medial limbic cortices. Selective destruction of caudal MD is known to disrupt mnemonic processes in both humans and monkeys, suggesting that this thalamic-limbic prefrontal loop may constitute an important pathway for memory.",,

Adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In a previous study (Hackett et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 394:475–495), we determined that the parabelt has topographic connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. Injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (MGd) and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM) nuclei. Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. The rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. The results suggest that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing, which is not influenced by direct inputs from primary cortical or subcortical auditory structures.

To this purpose, restricted injections of neuronal tracers were made into areas F3, F6, F2, and F7 after physiological identification of the injection sites. The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. The main inputs to F3 [supplementary motor area properly defined (SMA-proper)] originate in the nuclei ventral lateral, pars oralis (VLo), ventral posterior lateral, pars oralis (VPLo), and ventral lateral, pars caudalis (VLc) as well as in caudal parts of the VPLo and VLc (VPLo/VLc complex). F6 (pre-SMA) is mainly the target of nucleus ventral anterior, pars parvocellularis (VApc), and area X of Olszewski. The input to F2 originates mainly in the VPLo/VLc complex, in VLc, and in VLo. The dorsal part of F7 (supplementary eye field) mainly receives from area X, VApc, and nucleus ventral anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc), whereas the ventral F7 is connected with VApc, area X, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). It is concluded that each cortical area is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits. F3 and F2 are targets of the so-called “motor” basal ganglia circuit and a cerebellar circuit originating in dorsorostral sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. In contrast, F6 and ventral F7 receive a basal ganglia input mainly from the so-called “complex” circuit and a cerebellar input originating in the ventrocaudal sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. Finally, with respect to the rest of F7, dorsal F7 also receives a basal ganglia input from the “oculomotor circuit.” © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the ‘Anglo-American’ (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the ‘thalamic nucleus’; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral (‘relay’) and dorsal (‘associative’) ‘nuclei’. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic ‘region’ is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A ‘territory’ is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a ‘subregion’. For each of the studied ‘motor’ territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a ‘source space’. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A ‘thalamic nucleus’ is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The (‘dorsal’) thalamus is divided into ‘allo-’ and ‘isothalamus’, the latter with ‘bushy’ and ‘microneurons’. The lateral region is isothalamic. The ‘motor thalamus’ makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the ‘motor thalamus’ by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and ‘reslicing’. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated ‘cytoarchitectonic nuclei’. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' ‘V.im.e’, subject to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-médian-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedius-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars: nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM) cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",Primate; Motor system; Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus;,

Contrary to the prevailing belief that thalamocortical projections are entirely uncrossed, our findings indicate that a modest crossed projection to prefrontal cortex arises from the mesial thalamus, principally the anteromedial and midline nuclei. Also, while confirming that corticothalamic projections are bilateral, we found that the pattern of crossed projections differs from that of uncrossed projections. Projections to mesial thalamic nuclei, specifically to the anteromedial nucleus, the midline nuclei, and the magnocellular part of the mediodorsal nucleus are bilateral, the contralateral projection being nearly as dense as the ipsilateral projection. Projections to the parvicellular part of the mediodorsal and ventral anterior nuclei are also bilateral, but the contralateral projection is much weaker than the ipsilateral projection. Prefrontal projections to the reticular nucleus, medial pulvinar, suprageniculate nucleus, and limitans nucleus appear to be exclusively ipsilateral. These results indicate that prefrontal cortex has prominent bilateral and reciprocal connections with the nuclei of the mesial thalamic region. As this region of the diencephalon has been implicated by anatomical and behavioral studies in memory functions, our findings suggest that prefrontal cortex, through its connections with this region, may be involved in the bilateral integration of mnemonic systems.",,

Cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents,"The cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents of cingulate cortex were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatto). Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II–IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a–c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei. This latter nucleus projected more to area 23b than to areas 30 or 23a. Anterior medial nucleus efferents to cingulate cortex were of particular note for two reasons. First, AM projected primarily to posterior cingulate areas with area 23 receiving its principal thalamic input from AM. Second, projections to areas 30, 23a, and 23b were topographically organized with ventral areas 30 and 23a receiving from the central core of AM. While the more dorsally located area 23b received input from peripheral and medial. In light of the extensive projections of Cds, Csl, and Pf to anterior cingulate cortex, it is proposed that the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclie be classified as part of limbic thalamus along with the anterior, LD, and MD nuclei. Furthermore, although AM projects mainly to posterior cingulate cortex, it also has light projections to area 25 and minor input to area 24. As suhc, AM is the only limbic thalamic nucleus that has such widespread projections to cingulate cortex. Finally, visually evoked activity in area 23 may be the result of projections from the LP and medial pulvinar.",,

Following autoradiographic injections in VPM, the trigeminal somatosensory relay, a dense terminal plexus was labeled on SI cortex of both pre- and postcentral gyri, but not within insular-opercular cortex. The autoradiographic data were verified by injecting each cortical projection area with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and observing the pattern of retrogradely labeled somata within the thalamus. Injections in the precentral gyrus near the anterior subcentral sulcus retrogradely labeled neurons within VPMpc, whereas injections further caudally near the floor of the central sulcus labeled, neurons within VPM. Injections of HRP within opercular, insular, or posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex retrogradely labeled neurons within VPMpc.",,

Here we examine neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus, with focus on the mediodorsal (MD) and the anterior nuclei (ANT), to determine if neurogenesis of rostral and caudal thalamic nuclei is concurrent or instead temporally staggered. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N=10) of [3H]dT labeled specimens, with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Slides were scanned to create digital images for subsequent analysis using Stereo Investigator software. Labeled neurons were mapped within a contour that encompassed the entire rostral thalamus. These maps were superimposed onto closely corresponding sections from the online BrainMaps macaque atlas to facilitate analysis. Our novel approach uncovered a previously undetected spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus. At E30, labeled neurons were located in a compact medial band; at E38-E40, labeling was dense ventrolaterally, and at E43, labeling predominated laterally at rostral levels and was widely distributed at caudal levels. Peak neurogenesis occurs earlier in MD (E30-E43) and ANT (E31-E43) than in LGN (E36-E43) and PUL (E36-E45). Birth-dating of neurons in MD and ANT, two higher order relay nuclei implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, provides further insight into the critical period of vulnerability during which early developmental perturbation may increase incidence of schizophrenia later in life.","mediodorsal nucleus, anterior nucleus, neurodevelopment, schizophrenia",

The sublentiform (SL) and olivary (ON) nuclei receive projections from the visual cortex, superior colliculus (SC) and an equal bilateral projection from the retina. The nucleus of the posterior commissure (NPC) and its subdivisions do not receive any of these inputs. The projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input (i.e., SL and ON) and the region which does not (i.e., nucleus of the posterior commissure, NPC). For example, while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the SC, accessory oculomotor nuclei, reticular formation, intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus, it is only the retino-recipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei, the lateral pulvinar, the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar, the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta and other structures. It is concluded that the retina, SC and cortex which influence the visceral oculomotor nuclei can only do so by virtue of their projections to the pretectum, and that any consideration of accommodative and pupillary reflexes must view the pretectum as an obligatory link through which various structures can influence the intrinsic musculature of the eye. In contrast to the SC, the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus, such as the inferior pulvinar, which project to the visual cortices. Instead, the pretectum projects directly to visuomotor, visceromotor and arousal systems.",,

The retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons formed longitudinal bands, some of which crossed the internal medullary lamina, and extended from one thalamic nucleus into another. On the basis of these findings the frontal cortex was subdivided into seven transverse cortical strips which receive afferents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The most rostral transverse strip receives afferents from the most medial thalamic band which is oriented vertically and extends through the most medial part of the MD into the medial pulvinar. Progressively more caudally located transverse strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands which in part are situated in the VL and show an increasing tilt towards the horizontal. Moreover, those parts of the various bands which are situated along the dorsal and lateral margin of the thalamus project to the medial portions of the transverse cortical strips, i.e. along the medial margin of the frontal lobe, while the other parts situated ventromedially in the thalamus project to the lateral portions of these strips, i.e. along the lateral margin of the frontal lobe. These data provide an alternative view of the organization of the thalamus and suggest that this structure contains a matrix of longitudinal cell columns which in some cases extend across specific nuclear borders and may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the thalamo-cortical connexions.",,

The proposed changes in nomenclature are based on the analysis of topographical relationships between nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar projections to the thalamus studied in 13 rhesus monkeys with the use of autoradiography technique. Mapping of the projection zones of these motor-related systems in serial sagittal sections revealed that they are completely segregated with each honoring cytoarchitectonic boundaries of specific nuclear subdivisions. The available data on thalamic connectivity together with the results of the present study allowed us to divide the primate “motor” thalamus into two major territories: (1) the ventral anterior region (VA) and (2) the ventral lateral region (VL). Although the designation of these two areas of the motor thalamus is the same as the classic one, the nuclear subdivisions that compose them differ significantly from those described in previous classifications. As is delineated in the maps, VA represents the basal ganglia territory of the motor thalamus where nigral projections coincide with its magnocellular part (VAmc), and pallidal projections occupy densicellular (VAdc) and parvicellular (VApc) subdivisions. VAdc corresponds closely to VLo of Olszewski; however, we prefer the new term in order to avoid possible conceptual confusions with the ventral lateral region (VL), which does not receive basal ganglia projections. The VL region is characterized as a distinct cytoarchitectonic entity of the motor thalamus that receives cerebellar projections and includes area X, VPLo, VLc, and VLps of Olszewski. The ventral medial region (VM in the present study or VLm in Olszewski terminology) is usually considered together with the basal ganglia territory on a common connectional basis. However, we did not obtain convincing data to support this view, since evidence of terminal labeling was observed only in (or around) fiber bundles passing through the nucleus with other areas free of label. Rather, in this study VM was treated as an intermediate zone between the subthalamus and motor thalamus where fiber bundles from basal ganglia and cerebellum are organized in a topographical manner before reaching their destinations in the VA and VL regions, respectively. Other major thalamic regions represented in the maps were delineated purely on cytoarchitectonic grounds and their traditional nomenclature was maintained. In this respect the present maps can be considered as a supplement to the available cytoarchitectonic atlases of the monkey thalamus since the latter lack sagittal Plates. Additionally, the present atlas is constructed within an intracerebral coordinate system that relies on anterior and posterior brain commissures as landmarks. Thus it can be used as a guide for stereotactic placements in the thalamus by means of a recently developed technique that utilizes contrast ventriculography for the visualization of these landmarks. The advantages of this stereotactic technique and its superior accuracy compared to the conventional stereotactic methods have been demonstrated earlier.",,

Injections of tritiated leucine into different parts of the substantia nigra (SN) revealed that the medial SN projects to the medial magnocellular subdivisions of the ventral anterior (VAmc) and mediodorsal (MDmc) nuclei of the thalamus while the lateral SN projects to the more lateral and more posterior part of the VAmc, and the paralaminar, parvicellular, and densocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc). With the exception of the MDmf, terminal areas observed in the mediodorsal nucleus were in the form of scattered clusters of grains. Analysis of the thalamus in cases with fluorescent dye injections into the lateral orbital gyrus (Walker's area 11), principal sulcus (area 46), anterior bank of the arcuate gyrus (areas 8 and 45), supplementary motor area (area 6), and motor cortex (area 4) revealed topographic organization of the nigrothalamocortical projection system. The parts of the VAmc and MDmc which receive afferents from the medial part of the SN in turn project to the most anterior regions of the frontal lobe including principal sulcus and orbital cortex. The lateral posterior VAmc, MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc, all of which receive afferents from the lateral part of the SN, project to more posterior regions of the frontal lobe including, in addition to the principal sulcus, the frontal eye field and also areas of the premotor cortex. These findings indicate that the SN has preferential targets in the thalamus and cerebral cortex which are segregated from those of the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Whereas the motor cortex is the primary target of cerebellar output (Asanuma et al., 1983b), and the premotor cortex is the target of pallidal output (Schell and Strick, 1984), the SN output appears to be directed more anteriorally—;to the prefrontal cortex.",,

Extracellular action potentials were recorded from single neurons in the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial (VPMpc) nucleus of the thalamus of restrained, but alert, Old World monkeys during gustatory, tactile, and thermal stimulation of the oral cavity. In contrast to previous reports in anesthetized or paralyzed rats, the spontaneous activity of these neurons was brisk and their evoked responses robust. 2. Each of 50 taste-responsive neurons was tested with 1.0 M sucrose, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.003 M HCl, and 0.001 M QHCl before other concentrations of the same stimuli were used. Sucrose, which was effective in 80% of the neurons tested, evoked the largest responses of the 4 standard gustatory stimuli (16.1 spikes/s). The average response to NaCl, an effective stimulus for 44% of the neurons in the sample, was 7.5 spikes/s. HCl and QHCl, which few neurons responded to, typically evoked smaller responses. 3. Most of the neurons tested showed monotonic intensity-response (I-R) functions. The power functions showed about the same degree of compression (range = 0.39-0.53), which has been described previously for brain stem neurons in anesthetized rodents. Only 9.1% of the responses were inhibitory, and there was no tendency for these responses to be associated with either specific neurons or stimuli. These data suggest that quality coding of gustatory information in the thalamus is not radically different from that seen among lower-order neurons in other species. 4. Through the use of hierarchical cluster analysis, it was possible to divide the neuron sample into 2 groups, one of which consisted of sucrose-best neurons that had an average entropy value of 0.56. The neurons in the other group, though more heterogeneous, showed either primary or side-band sensitivity to NaCl. The average breadth of responsiveness of the 50 thalamic neurons as described by the entropy coefficient was 0.73. 5. In addition to gustatory neurons, tactile (n = 15), thermal (n = 1), and nonresponsive (n = 25) neurons also were located within VPMpc. An additional 48 neurons that could not be classified as either sensory or motor in nature, inhibited their bursting spontaneous discharge just prior to the onset of fluid stimulation. Only 2 of these neurons demonstrated differential chemical sensitivity. The presence of these nongustatory neurons within the thalamic taste area suggests that the traditional characterization of VPMpc as a gustatory relay may understate its role in ingestive behavior and ignore other noningestive functions of the area.",,

Nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were found in the periphery of the contralateral integument compartment of the VB complex. Thus, they formed a shell at the perimeter of this compartment with a somatotopic organization. The compartment consisted of large parts of nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc). NS neurons were located more caudally than WDR neurons. In the NS zone of VPM, the forehead was represented caudally, and oral structures rostrally. In the ventral NS zone of VPM, there was a sequential representation of the tongue, gum and mandibular skin from the medial to the lateral edge. The hand was represented medially in the NS zone of VPLc, and its representation dominated in the rostral NS zone. There was a sequential representation of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal segments mediolaterally along the dorsal VPLc. In the medial half of ventral NS zone of VPLc, the upper body half was represented, and in the lateral half, the lower body half. The foot was represented at or near the medial edge of lateral half.

Twelve monkeys were trained to pull a handle given one colour cue and to turn it given another. Bilateral lesions were then placed in the ventral thalamus. Four monkeys with large anterior lesions including the VA nucleus and the anterior part of VLo were severely impaired at relearning the task. Monkeys with small lesions in VAmc or with lesions centred on VLo were not impaired. The analysis of the histology suggests that the impairment in the four monkeys did not result from involvement of the cerebellar relay through nucleus X. It is argued that the animals are not impaired because of faulty execution. This suggests that the basal ganglia have an influence on motor learning.,,

Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (S2), the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration. S2 was shown to receive its major thalamic input from the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPI) and not, as previously reported, from the caudal division of the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPLc). Following small injections of isotope or HRP into the hand representation of S2, only VPI was labeled. Larger injections, which included the representations of more body parts, led to heavy label in VPI, with scattered label in VPLc, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the posterior nucleus (Po). In addition, small isotope injections into VPLc did not result in label in S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site, and ablations of S2 led to cell loss in VPI. Comparison of injections involving different body parts in S2 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within VPI such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially. The location of the thalamic representations of the head, face, and intraoral structures that project to S2 may be in the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPM). The granular (Ig) and dysgranular (Id) fields of the insula and the retroinsular field (Ri) each receive inputs from a variety of nuclei located at the posteroventral border of the thalamus. Ig receives its heaviest input from the suprageniculate-limitans complex (SG-Li), with additional inputs from Po, the magnocellular division of the medial geniculate n. (MGmc), VPI, and the medial pulvinar (Pulm). Id receives its heaviest input from the basal ventromedial n. (VMb), with additional inputs from VPI, Po, SG-Li, MGmc, and Pulm. Ri receives its heaviest input from Po, with additional input from SG-Li, MGmc, Pulm, and perhaps VPI. Area 7b receives its input from Pulm, the oral division of the pulvinar, the lateral posterior n., the medial dorsal n., and the caudal division of the ventrolateral n. These results indicate that the somatic cortical fields, except for those comprising the first somatosensory area, each receive inputs from an array of thalamic nuclei, rather than just one, and that individual thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei each project to more than one cortical field.",,

The cerebellar nuclei give rise to a massive projection to the contralateral midbrain and thalamus via the ascending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle. Cerebellar efferent fibers terminate contralaterally in both divisions of the red nucleus, and bilaterally in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, the oculomotor nucleus, and the central gray. All the deep cerebellar nuclei project upon a broad area of the contralateral ventral thalamus as well as certain intralaminar nuclei. Corresponding ipsilateral thalamic terminations are sparse. The topograpic organization of cerebellothalamic fibers does not correspond to individual cerebellar nuclei or to cytoarchitectonic divisions of the ventral thalamic nuclei. Rather there are longitudinally oriented strips of terminal labeling which extend through all divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus, i.e., the VLps, the VLc, the VLo, as well as nucleus X, the oral division of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the most caudal region of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA). The topography of the cerebellothalamic fibers is arranged in a mediolateral pattern with fibers originating from anterior zones of the dentate and interpositus ending most laterally and those from posterior dentate and interpositus terminating most medially. The fastigial contribution is relatively sparse. The longitudinal strips of terminal labeling in the ventral thalamic nuclei are made up of still smaller terminal units consisting of disk-like aggregates of silver grains separated from one another by grain-free spaces. The dorsal column nuclei terminate primarily in the contralateral caudal division of the VPL (VPLc) and never extend rostrally into VPLo. These results demonstrate a segregation of cerebellar and dorsal columnar inputs to motor and sensory regions of the thalamus, respectively. Since these regions are separate and discrete in their cortical associations as well (Kalil, 1976), it seems unlikely that fast afferent pathways relaying to motor cortex (Lemon and Porter, 1976) could arise from the dorsal column nuclei.",,

II. Vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence at thalamic neurons,"The vestibular thalamic relay in the Rhesus ventrobasal complex, identified in a previous field potential study (part I, Deecke et al., 1974), has now been investigated with neuronal recordings in the thalamus in order to clarify its functional role. In part I, short latency responses (2.5 msec) were found in the corner between VPL, VPM and VPI nuclei, largely including dorsal portions of the VPI nucleus. Field potentials of somewhat longer latency (4–5 msec) were recorded in VPL and in other thalamic nuclei, including the posterior nuclear group. Neuronal responses were recorded in thalamic nuclei of awake flaxedilized Rhesus monkeys. Cells not responding to vestibular stimulation (round window polarisation of either labyrinth) were ignored. The great majority (80%) of those neurons responding to labyrinth polarisation showed convergence with deep somatic (proprioceptive) input from joints and muscles of vertebral column and limbs. 60% of these bimodal neurons responded to movement of cervical joints. Very few vestibularly responsive cells received cutaneous (6.6%), non-optokinetic visual or auditory (2.6% each) input. Proprioceptive fields tended to be large, frequently involving more than one joint, and could be even bilateral. For a few cells the pattern of vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence could be fitted to a coordinated body position that might occur during normal locomotion. 78% of the cells responded to polarisation of both labyrinths, indicating strong bilateral projection.",,

In addition to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of MD, three other subdivisions can be recognized on the basis of myeloarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and connections. The first two of these represent a parcellation of the magnocellular division into a lateral, fiber-rich MD pars fibrosa and a medial, poorly myelinated MD pars paramediana adjacent to the midline. The third is a small, poorly myelinated area located at the caudomedial and dorsal edges of MD; it is referred to as MD pars caudodorsalis. MD pars fibrosa is reciprocally interconnected primarily with areas 11, 12 and 13 in the central and lateral part of the orbital cortex. There is a general organization within this projection, with the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex represented from dorsal to ventral in the pars fibrosa, and the mediolateral cortical axis represented from medial to lateral. Cells that project to area 12 also extend laterally into the adjacent pars parvicellularis. MD pars paramediana is more heavily interconnected with the caudal and medial portions of the orbital region, particularly the agranular insular areas and the caudal parts of areas 13 and 14. Cells that project to two caudal areas, 13a and Iad, do not fit with the general organization, in that they are located in the dorsomedial parts of the pars fibrosa and pars paramediana, where they overlap with cells that project to area 14. The pars fibrosa and pars paramediana receive inputs from areas of the ventral forebrain such as the amygdala, piriform (olfactory) cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, as well as from the ventral pallidum. MD pars caudodorsalis is reciprocally interconnected with areas 14, 24, and 32 on the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex. In this part of the nucleus the dorsoventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is represented from caudal to rostral in the thalamus. The amygdala and other ventral forebrain structures do not send fibers into the pars caudodorsalis, even though some of these structures project directly to the medial prefrontal cortex. Ventral to MD, and separated from it by the internal medullary lamina, a small region was recognized that appears to be comparable to the anteroventral part of the submedial nucleus previously defined in the rat and cat. This region receives input from the piriform cortex and is interconnected with orbital cortical area 13a. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

In the present study WGA-HRP injections were placed in the different subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey to determine whether a similarly complex pattern also exists in the thalamocortical pathway. Additionally, in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe, multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Different subdivisions of the parietal lobe appear to receive different sets of thalamic input. Thus the superior parietal lobule (SPL) projections are derived from more lateral regions in the thalamus, arising predominantly from the lateral posterior (LP) and pulvinar oralis (PO) nuclei, with additional contributions from the pulvinar lateralis (PL) and pulvinar medialis (PM) nuclei. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), by contrast, receives its projections from more medial thalamic regions, its main thalamic input originating from PM, and aided by LP, PL, and PO. Both the SPL and IPL also receive projections from the mediodorsal (MD), ventroposterior, ventrolateral, intralaminar, and limbic nuclei, albeit from different components within these nuclei. A topographical arrangement also exists in the thalamic projections to the rostral versus the caudal subdivisions of both the SPL and the IPL. Thus, in the SPL, the ventral posterolateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo), ventral lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VLo), and ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis (VLm) project to rostral, whereas the PM and limbic nuclei, anteroventral (AV), and anteromedial (AM), project to area PGm on the medial convexity of the SPL. With respect to projections to the IPL, the ventral posteromedial (VPM) and PO nuclei project to rostral regions, whereas the limbic nuclei lateral dorsal (LD), AM and AV project only to the caudalmost area, Opt. A rostrocaudal difference is reflected also within certain nuclei (LP, PO, and PM) that project to the SPL or IPL. Thus rostral parietal subdivisions receive projections from ventral regions within these thalamic nuclei, whereas caudal parietal afferents arise from the dorsal parts of these nuclei. Intervening cortical levels receive projections from intermediate positions within the nuclei. It therefore seems that the increasing architectonic and functional complexity as one moves from rostral to caudal in the SPL and IPL appear to be reflected in the thalamic afferents. More rostral areas relate to modality-specific thalamic nuclei, whereas more caudal regions concerned with complex functions derive their input from multimodal and limbic nuclei.",,

Ipsilateral corticothalamic projections were traced to Olszewski's nucleus ventralis lateralis pars oralis and pars medialis, the nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis, the nucleus ventralis posterior medialis and inferior and to the nucleus reticularis. Some fibers appeared to terminate in the ipsilateral nucleus ventralis lateralis pars caudalis, the nucleus lateralis posterior and the nucleus subthalamicus. A bilateral representation was found in the nucleus centrum medianum, possibly in the paracentralis-centralis lateralis complex and in the paralamellar portion of the nucleus medialis dorsalis. The contralateral labeling was due to fibers crossing via the massa intermedia and was most intense in the cases following injections into the motor face region. A somatotopic arrangement was clearly present in the nucleus ventralis lateralis pars oralis, the nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis and the nucleus ventralis posterior medialis. The origin of the projections to the nucleus ventralis posterior medialis needs further clarification.",,

The interrelationship of medial area 6 (supplementary motor area) with the thalamus was investigated by means of anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. Nine monkeys were prepared for autoradiography or histochemistry with the marker HRP conjugated to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Three of the monkeys received injections into the precentral cortex for comparison. 2. Previous observations were confirmed that the thalamic relays to the motor areas are organized as crescent-shaped lamellae which transgress cytoarchitectonic boundaries. The thalamic VA-VL complex receiving fibres from areas 4 and medial area 6 also sends fibres to these same areas. 3. The thalamic relay to medial area 6 comprised the following subdivisions: VLo, VLc, area X of Olszewski, VLm and, to a smaller extent VA. 4. Labeling (mostly anterograde only) was also prominent in some thalamic compartments outside the ‘motor’ thalamus: R, CL, CM-Pf, MD, LP, PULo. 5. It was noted that rostral and caudal injections into the medial area 6 resulted in different thalamic labeling: The rostral portion was found to be related mainly with VApc, area X and VLc, the central portion with VLo, and the caudal portion with VLc/VLo. This structural inhomogeneity may reflect also a functional rostro-caudal differentiation of the medial area 6. 6. The thalamic territory projecting to the precentral cortex is separate from the above relay and includes principally VPLo. 7. The present anatomical labeling study is in agreement with the conclusion of Schell and Strick (1984) that the SMA, especially its central portion, is an important target of basal ganglia outflow via the thalamic relay VLo. In addition consistent labeling was also found in thalamic subdivisions (area X, VLc) which had been found to receive cerebellar fibres.",,

Although it has been shown that both the cortical and thalamic representations can reorganize, uncertainties exist regarding the extent, nature, and time course of changes at each level. We have determined how cortical representations in the somatosensory area 3b and the ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of thalamus are affected by long standing unilateral dorsal column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys. In monkeys with recovery periods of 22–23 months, the intact face inputs expanded into the deafferented hand region of area 3b after complete or partial lesions of the dorsal columns. The expansion of the face region could extend all the way medially into the leg and foot representations. In the same monkeys, similar expansions of the face representation take place in the VP nucleus of the thalamus, indicating that both these processing levels undergo similar reorganizations. The receptive fields of the expanded representations were similar in somatosensory cortex and thalamus. In two monkeys, we determined the extent of the brain reorganization immediately after dorsal column lesions. In these monkeys, the deafferented regions of area 3b and the VP nucleus became unresponsive to the peripheral touch immediately after the lesion. No reorganization was seen in the cortex or the VP nucleus. A comparison of the extents of deafferentation across the monkeys shows that even if the dorsal column lesion is partial, preserving most of the hand representation, it is sufficient to induce an expansion of the face representation.","plasticity, spinal cord injury, dorsal column, primate, microelectrode, mapping, receptive field",

The thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. Modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant in the rodent thalamus. We show that dopaminergic axons profusely target the human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). The dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. We also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. The origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. We propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Investigating this “thalamic dopaminergic system” should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","dopamine, dopamine transporter, dopaminergic systems, thalamus, human, monkey",

Inferior area 6 has been further subdivided into two histochemical areas: area F5, located along the inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus, and area F4, located between area F5 and area 4 (area F1). The present study traced the thalamocortical projections of inferior area 6 and the adjacent part of area 4 by injecting small amounts of WGA-HRP in specific sectors of the agranular frontal cortex. Our data showed that each histochemical area receives a large projection from one nucleus of the ventrolateral thalamus (motor thalamus) and additional projections from other nuclei of this thalamic sector. Area F5 receives a large projection from area X of Olszewski ('52) and additional projections from the caudal part of the nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), and the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) (VPLo-VLc complex). Area F4 receives a large projection from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and additional projections from area X and the VPLo-VLc complex. The rostral part of area F1 is innervated chiefly by VLo, plus smaller contributions from rostral VPLo and the VPLo-VLc complex. The caudal part of F1 receives its greatest input from VPLo, with a small contribution from VLo. In addition, each histochemical area receives projections originating from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the posterior thalamus, and–for area F4 and area F5–also from the nucleus medialis dorsalis (MD). Analysis of the physiological properties of the various histochemical areas in relation to their main thalamic input showed that those cortical fields in which distal movements are predominant (area F5, caudal part of area F1) are innervated chiefly by area X and VPLo, wheras those cortical fields in which proximal movements are predominant receive their main input from VLo. Because VPLo and area X are targets of cerebellothalamic pathways, whereas VLo receives a pallidal input, we propose that the cortical fields in which distal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the cerebellum, whereas the cortical fields in which proximal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the basal ganglia.",,

Subcortical pathways and topography of striatal and thalamic terminal fields,"Anterograde tracers (tritiated leucine, proline, fucose; WGA-HRP) were injected into sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) of nine macaque monkeys. Low thresholds (≤50 μA) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. Dorsomedial prearcuate injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as lFEF cases, whereas ventrolateral prearcuate sites where small saccades were evoked were designated sFEF cases. One control case was injected in the medial postarcuate area 6. We found five descending fiber bundles from FEF; fibers to the striatum, which enter the caudate nucleus at or just rostral to the genu of the internal capsule; fibers to the claustrum, which travel in the external capsule; and transthalamic, subthalamic, and pedunculopontine fibers. Our results indicate that transthalamic and subthalamic pathways supply all terminal sites in the thalamus, subthalamus, and tegmentum of the midbrain and pons, whereas pedunculopontine fibers appear to terminate in the pontine and reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus exclusively. Frontal eye field terminal fields in the striatum were topographically organized: lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Thus, lFEF terminal fields were located centrally in the head and body of the caudate nucleus and a small dorsomedial portion of the putamen, whereas sFEF terminal fields were located in ventrolateral parts of the caudate body and ventromedial parts of the putamen. In the claustrum, lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Projections from FEF terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography. By comparison, terminal fields from medial postarcuate area 6 were located more caudally and laterally in the striatum and claustrum than projections from FEF, and more centrally in the subthalamic nucleus. In the thalamus, FEF terminal patches in some thalamic nuclei were also topographically organized. Projections from lFEF terminated in dorsal area X, dorsolateral medial dorsal nucleus, pars parvicellularis (MDpc), and the caudal pole of MDpc, whereas projections from sFEF terminated in ventral area X, medial dorsal nucleus, pars multiformis, and caudal medial dorsal nucleus pars densocellularis. Characteristically, projections from postarcuate area 6 terminated in central ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis.

AChE histochemistry is very useful in delineating the thalamic nuclei connected with the association cortex and in uncovering thalamic subdivisions that are barely evident on cytoarchitectonic grounds. Moreover, AChE activity reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneities within several thalamic nuclei, like the ventral anterior (VA), where a new ventromedial subdivision (VAvm) is described, the medial pulvinar (PuIM) or the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In this nucleus three distinct chemical domains are present: the medial, ventral and lateral sectors characterized by low, moderate and high AChE activities, respectively. The staining pattern of the lateral sector is markedly heterogeneous with patches of intense AChE activity surrounded by a moderately stained matrix. The MD medial sector is connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the AChE-rich patches in the lateral sector are selectively connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal association cortices. In the PulM, a dorsomedial AChE-rich patch is selectively connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the surrounding territory, which shows moderate AChE activity, is preferentially connected with the parietal and temporal cortices. Chemically specific domains in the anterior, ventral anterior, midline, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are also connected with the examined association cortices. These findings indicate that the topographic patterns of the thalamo-cortical connections of primate association areas conform to the chemical architecture of the thalamus. This implies that because each cortical area is connected to a particular set of thalamic regions, the influence of the thalamus on cortical function is exclusive for each area, highly diverse among the various association areas, and subject to a wide range of modulation at the thalamic level.","Mediodorsal nucleus; Medial pulvinar nucleus; Anterior thalamic nuclei; Midline thalamic nuclei; Intralaminar thalamic nuclei; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; AD, anterodorsal nucleus; AM, anteromedial nucleus; AMdc, anteromedial nucleus, densocellular part; AV, anteroventral nucleus; Cdc, central nucleus, densocellular part; CeM, central medial nucleus; Cif, central nucleus, inferior part; Cim, central nucleus, intermediate part; CL, central lateral nucleus; Clc, central nucleus, latocellular part; CnMd, centromedian nucleus; Cs, central nucleus, superior part; Csl, central nucleus, superior lateral part; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HRP-WGA, peroxidase labeled wheat germ agglutinin; LD, lateral dorsal nucleus; Li, nucleus limitans; LP, lateral posterior nucleus; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; MDI, mediodorsal nucleus, lateral sector; MDm, mediodorsal nucleus, medial sector; MDv, mediodorsal nucleus, ventral sector; Pcn, paracentral nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; Pt, paratenial nucleus; Pull, inferior pulvinar nucleus; PulM, medial pulvinar nucleus; PulL, lateral pulvinar nucleus; Pv, paraventricular nucleus; R, reticular nucleus; Re, nucleus reuniens; SG, suprageniculate nucleus; STP, superior temporal polysensory area; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; VA, ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc, ventral anterior nucleus, magnocellular subdivision; VApc, ventral anterior nucleus, parvocellular subdivision; VAvm, ventral anterior nucleus, ventromedial subdivision; VLo, ventral lateral nucleus, oral subdivision;",

The results indicate that in addition to its well-known connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, MDm receives fibers from many parts of the basal forebrain, including the ventral pallidum and other parts of the substantia innominata, the amygdaloid complex, the primary olfactory cortex, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and the cortex at the pole of the temporal lobe. Lighter projections arise in the subiculum, the ventral insula, and the superior and inferior temporal gyri. The cells that project to MDm tend to be large, polymorphic neurons. Throughout most of the basal forebrain they are diffusely distributed through several nuclei or cortical layers, without obvious relation to nuclear or laminar boundaries. The major exception to this is in the ventral pallidum, where there is a dense concentration of cells that project to MDm. The lateral part of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDl) receives few if any fibers from the basal forebrain and temporal lobe, but is innervated by several brainstem structures, especially the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the midbrain tegmental fields. In MDm, the fibers are distributed in irregular patches. Three-dimensional analysis indicates that these patches are often clustered into separate bands or columns at different anteroposterior levels. In addition, the strongest projections from the three major regions that innervate MDm are organized in a complex three-dimensional pattern. First, the fibers from the amygdaloid nuclei terminate most heavily (but not exclusively) in the rostral third of MDm. The parvicellular accessory basal amygdaloid nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area project principally to the dorsal part of the nucleus. The parvicellular basal nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex project to the ventromedial quadrant of MDm; and the magnocellular basal nucleus, the magnocellular accessory basal nucleus, and the lateral nucleus all project to the ventrolateral quadrant. Second, the substantia innominata projects preferentially to the caudal part of MDm. The medial part of the substantia innominata, especially the ventral pallidum, innervates the dorsomedial quadrant, while more caudal and lateral areas of this region project ventrolaterally. Third, the projections arising from the entorhinal and other temporal cortical areas terminate primarily in the mid-rostrocaudal level of MDm. Fibers from the entorhinal area tend to end dorsally, while those from the perirhinal cortex or the temporal polar cortex end more ventrally. Electrophysiological responses to stimulation of the olfactory bulb were found only in the anterior third of MDm. Responsive units were clustered in short zones along each electrode track, probably corresponding to the patches of afferent fibers seen with axonal tracers.",,

Inputs to different zones of motor, premotor, and postarcuate cortex, supplementary motor area, and areas 3b/1 and 2/5 in the postcentral cortex, were examined. Coincident labeling of thalamocortical neuron populations with different dyes (1) increased the precision with which their soma distributions could be related within thalamic space, and (2) enabled the detection by double labeling, of individual thalamic neurons that were common to the thalamic soma distributions projecting to separate, dye-injected cortical zones. Double-labeled thalamic neurons projecting to sensorimotor cortex were rarely seen in mature macaques, even when the injection sites were only 1–1.5 mm apart, implying that their terminal arborizations were quite restricted horizontally. By contrast, separate neuron populations in each thalamic nucleus with input to sensorimotor cortex projected to more than one cytoarchitecturally distinct cortical area. In ventral posterior lateral (oral) (VPLo), for example, separate populations of cells sent axons to precentral medial, and lateral area 4, medial premotor, and postarcuate cortex, as well as to supplementary motor area. Extensive convergence of thalamic input even to the smallest zones of dye uptake in the cortex (≈0.5 mm3) characterized the sensorimotor cortex. The complex forms of these projection territories were explored using 3-dimensional reconstructions from coronal maps. These projection territories, while highly ordered, were not contained by the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of individual thalamic nuclei. Their organization suggests that the integration of the diverse information from spinal cord, cerebellum, and basal ganglia that is needed in the execution of complex sensorimotor tasks begins in the thalamus.",,

Tritiated amino acid injections limited to the insula revealed autoradiographic label in the principal and parvicellular components of the ventroposterior medial nucleus, the ventroposterior inferior nucleus, the oral and medial pulvinar nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, the parvicellular and magnocellular components of the medial dorsal nucleus, the centromedian-parafasicularis nuclei, and the reticular nucleus. In additional animals, tritiated amino acids and horseradish perioxidase injections were made within different regions of the insula. Although the injection sites in these additional cases may have included minor extensions into claustrum and adjacent structures, several tentative conclusions emerged with respect to the antero-posterior gradient in insulothalamic connectivity. The anterior insula appears to have a more extensive relationship with the ventroposterior medial complex, the medial dorsal nucleus, the centromedian-parafasicularis nuclei and with some midline nuclei. In contrast, the posterior insula is more extensively connected with the ventroposterior inferior nucleus, the oral and medial pulvinar nuclei, and the suprageniculate nucleus. The patterns of insulothalamic connections support conclusions derived from observations on the cortical connectivity of the primate insular cortex indicating that the anterior insula is related to olfactory, gustatory, and viscero-autonomic behavior, whereas the posterior insula is related to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function (Mesulam and Mufson, '82b). The medial pulvinar nucleus has extensive connections with many paralimbic cortical regions including the insula as well as with high order polymodal association cortex. These findings suggest that the medial pulvinar may provide a region for the convergence of multisensory association input with limbic information.",,

It is not known however, whether contralateral thalamocortical projections reach particular cortices or whether they emanate from specific nuclei. In the rhesus monkey different types of cortices, ranging from transitional to eulaminate, vary in their cortical connectional pattern and may also differ in thier thalamic connections. Because olfactory and transitional prefrontal cortices receive widespread projections, we investaged whether they are the target of projections from the contralateral thalamus as well. With the aid of retrograde tracers, we studied the thalamic projections of primary olfactory (olfactory tubercle and prepiriform cortex) and transitional orbital (areas PAPP, Pro 13) and medial (areas 25, 24, 32) areas, and of eulaminate (areas 11, 12, 9) cortices for comparison. To determine the prevalence of neurons in the contralateral thalamus, we compared them with the ipsilateral in each case. The pattern of ipsilateral thalamic projections differed somewhat among orbital, medial, and olfactory cortices. The mediodorsal nucleus was the predominant source of projections to orbital areas, midline nuclei included consistently about 25% of the thalamic neurons directed to medial transitional cortices, and primary olfactory areas were distinguished by receiving thalamic projections predominantly from neurons in midline and intralaminar nuclei. Notwithstanding some broad differences in the ipsilateral thalamofrontal projections, which appeared to depend on cortical location, the pattern of contralateral projections was thalamus were noted in midline, the magnocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the anterior medial and intralaminar nuclei, and ranged from 0 to 14% of the ipsilateral; they were directed primarily to olfactory and transitional orbital and medical cortices but rarely projected to eulaminate areas. Several thalamic nuclei projected from both sides to olfactory and transitional areas, but issued only ipsilateral projections to eulaminate areas. Though ipsilateral thalamocortical projections predominate in adult mammalian species, crossed projections are a common feature in development. The results suggest differences in the persistence of contralateral thalamocortical interactions between transitional and eulaminate cortices. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Such dual pattern of corticothalamic projections is well established in rodents and cats for many cortical areas. In non-human primates (monkeys), it has been reported for the primary sensory cortices (A1, V1, S1), the motor and premotor cortical areas and, in the parietal lobe, also for area 7. The present study aimed first at refining the cytoarchitecture parcellation of area 5 into the sub-areas PE and PEa and, second, establishing whether area 5 also exhibits this dual pattern of corticothalamic projection and what is its precise topography. To this aim, the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected in area PE in one monkey and in area PEa in a second monkey. Area PE sends a major projection terminating with small endings to the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LP), ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL), medial pulvinar (PuM) and, but fewer, to ventral lateral posterior nucleus, dorsal division (VLpd), central lateral nucleus (CL) and center median nucleus (CM), whereas giant endings formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL and PuM. For area PEa, the corticothalamic projection formed by small endings was found mainly in LP, VPL, anterior pulvinar (PuA), lateral pulvinar (PuL), PuM and, to a lesser extent, in ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), CL, mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and CM.

The results indicate that the distribution of thalamic projections varies along the rostral-caudal dimension of the STS. Thus the rostral portion of the upper bank receives input primarily from the medialmost portion of the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. The middle region of the upper bank receives projections from medial and central portions of the PM nucleus, and also from the oral pulvinar, limitans, suprageniculate, medial geniculate, and dorsomedial nuclei. The cortex of the caudal portion of the upper bank has basically similar thalamic input; however, the projections from the PM nucleus originate in central and lateral portions. Additionally, there are projections from the lateral pulvinar (PL), ventroposterolateral, central lateral, parafascicular, and paracentral nuclei. In contrast to the dorsal bank, the cortex of the ventral bank of the STS receives somewhat different and less extensive thalamic input. The rostral portion of the lower bank receives projections only from the ventromedial sector of the PM nucleus whereas the middle portion of the lower bank receives projections from the PL and the inferior pulvinar nuclei as well as from the PM nucleus. The upper bank of the STS, on the basis of physiological and anatomical studies (Jones and Powell, '70; Seltzer and Pandya, '78; Gross et al., '81; Baylis et al., '87), has been shown to contain multimodal areas. The present data indicate that the multimodal region of the STS has a preferential relationship with the central sector of the PM nucleus.",,

All major sensory (medial geniculate. lateral geniculate, ventrobasal). motor (venlroanterior. ventrolateral. ventromedial), associational (mediodorsal, pulvinar, lateral posterior) and limbic (anteromedial.,interoventral) thalamic nuclei of the cat were found to receive projections from cholinergic neurons located in the peribrachial area of the pedunculopontine nucleus and in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus as well as from non-cholinergic neurons in the rostral (perirubral) part of the central tegmental mesencephalic field. Specific relay nuclei receive less than 10%) of their brainstem afferents from non-cholinergic neurons located at rostral midbrain levels and receive 85 96% of their brainstem innervation from a region at midbrain pontinc junction where the cholinergic perihrachial area and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus are maximally developed. of the total number of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem neurons seen after injections in various specific relay nuclei, the double-labeled (horseradish peroxidase + choline acetyltransferase) neurons represent approximately 70 85%. Three to eight times more numerous horseradish peroxidase-labeled brainstem cells were found after injections in associational (mediodorsal and pulvinar lateral posterior complex) and diffusely cortically projecting (ventromedial) thalamic nuclei of cat than after injections in specific relay nuclei. The striking retrograde cell labeling observed after injections in nuclei with associative functions and widespread cortical projections was due to massive afferentation from non-cholinergic parts of the midbrain and pontine reticular formation, on both ipsi- and contralateral sides. After wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase injections in the associative pulvinar lateral posterior complex and mediodorsal nucleus of Macaca sylvana.. 45 50% of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem peribrachial neurons were also choline acetyltransferase-positive. While cells in the medial part of the cholinergic peribrachial area were found to project especially towards the pulvinar lateral posterior nuclear complex in monkey, the retrograde cell labeling seen after the mediodorsal injection was mostly confined to the lateral part of both dorsal and ventral aspects of the peribrachial area.

A light and electron microscopic study†","The projections of the superior colliculus to the thalamus have been studied in the monkey, Macaca mulatta, with anterograde degeneration techniques. The superior colliculus has been shown to project to the inferior nucleus of the pulvinar in a topographical manner with the lower visual field represented dorsomedially and the upper field ventrolaterally. The peripheral zone is located along the medial border and the fovea at the dorsolateral angle adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The superior colliculus also sends a dense projection to the ipsilateral intralaminar complex, i.e., to the parafascicular, central lateral and paracentral nuclei, and a lesser projection to the same contralateral nuclei. Degenerating tectal fibers were also found in the lateral geniculate nuclei. Four types of vesicle containing profiles were observed in the inferior pulvinar and paracentral nucleus. The large RL and small RS terminals contain round vesicles of uniform size and form asymmetric contacts mainly with large and small dendrites respectively. The F terminal contains a mixture of small round and flat vesicles. It forms symmetric contacts with dendrites and cell somata. The P profile is very pale and contains a relatively sparse population of vesicles showing a great variation in size. It forms symmetric contacts with medium to large dendrites. It is frequently found postsynaptic to the other types, especially the RL terminal, and is regularly seen as the intermediate element of serial and triadic synaptic arrangements. The experimental electron microscopic study has shown that many fibers from the superior colliculus terminate as RL profiles, undergoing direct dense degeneration, in both the inferior pulvinar and the paracentral nucleus. Others probably end as smaller RS terminals.",,

Single thalamocortical axons were recorded extracellularly in the white matter by using horseradish-peroxidase-filled pipettes. Their receptive fields were mapped and classified as corresponding to those of parvi- or magnocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. The axons were then impaled and injected intraaxonally with horseradish peroxidase. Two magnocellular (MA) and two parvicellular (PA) axons were successfully recovered and reconstructed in three dimensions. The two MA axons arborised mainly in layer 4Cβ, as did the two PA axons in layer 4Cβ. Few collaterals formed varicosities in layer 6. Both MA axons had two large, elongated clumps of bouton (approx. 300–500 × 600–1,200 μm each) and a small clump. One PA axon had two clumps (each with a core appr. 200 μm in diameter); the other had only one (appr. 150–200 μm in diameter). The PA axon with two clumps had 1,520 boutons; the other PA axon had 1,380; one MA axon had 3,200 boutons; and those of the more extensive MA axon were not counted. The distribution of postsynaptic targets as well as the number of synapses per bouton has been established for a sample of 150 PA boutons and 173 MA boutons from serial ultrathin sections. The MA axons made on average 2.1 synapses per bouton compared to 1.79 for one PA axon and 2.6 for the other. The sample of boutons taken from the two physiological types of axons contacted similar proportions of dendritic spines (52–68%), shafts (33–47%), and somata (0–3%). The postsynaptic elements were further characterized by immunostaining for GABA. All postsynaptic perikarya and some of the dendrites (4.5–9.5% of all targets) were positive for the amino acid. Near the thalamic synapse GABA-negative dendritic shafts frequently contained lamellar bodies, an organelle identical in structure to spine apparatus. Dendritic shafts and spines postsynaptic to the thalamocortical boutons frequently received an adjacent synapse from GABA-immunoreactive boutons. The similarity between the magno- and parvicellular axons in their targeting of postsynaptic elements, including the GABAergic neurons, suggests that the structural basis of the physiological differences between 4Cα and 4Cβ neurons should be sought in other aspects of the circuitry of layer 4C, such as local cortical circuits, or in the far greater horizontal extent of the thalamocortical and GABAergic axons in layer 4Cα compared to those in the β subdivision.",,

Different portions of the hand representation in area 3b were injected with different anatomical tracers in the same animal, or matched body part representations in parietal areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and areas 2 and 5 were injected with different anatomical tracers in the same animal to directly compare their thalamocortical connections. We found that the somatosensory thalamus is composed of several representations of cutaneous and deep receptors of the contralateral body. These nuclei include the ventral posterior nucleus, the ventral posterior superior nucleus, the ventral posterior inferior nucleus, and the ventral lateral nucleus. Each nucleus projects to several different cortical fields, and each cortical field receives projections from multiple thalamic nuclei. In contrast to other sensory systems, each of these somatosensory cortical fields is uniquely innervated by multiple thalamic nuclei. These data indicate that multiple inputs are processed simultaneously within and across several, “hierarchically connected” cortical fields.","area 1, area 2, area 5, posterior parietal cortex, topographic connections",

However, the underlying basis for this topography as it relates to the organization of the different architectonically defined areas of the prefrontal cortex has not been systematically studied. In the present investigation we have reassessed the thalamic projections from the different architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex by using the technique of autoradiography in the rhesus monkey. The results show that the prefrontomediodorsal projections are organized according to the architectonic differentiation of the prefrontal cortices. Thus architectonically less differentiated medial and orbital prefrontal regions project to the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision. In contrast, highly differentiated prefrontal area 8 projects to the most lateral sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the multiformis subdivision. Lateral prefrontal areas with intermediate architectonic features project to the central parvocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus. Additionally, these projections also reveal a dorsoventral topography. Thus areas in the medial and dorsolateral cortices project to the dorsal part of the mediodorsal nucleus. In contrast, areas in orbital and ventrolateral cortices project to the ventral part of the mediodorsal nucleus. The topographic organization of the corticothalamic connections described in this study corresponds to the progressive elaboration and differentiation of the architectonic features of the different prefrontal areas. This successive and dichotomous organization of prefrontothalamic connections may provide the basis for the observed differential functions of the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal nucleus.",,

The lateral route, named “lateral grasping network”, is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named “reach-to-grasp network”, is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments.","Dorsal visual stream, Sensorimotor integration, Goal-directed arm movement, Area V6, Area V6A, Area PEc",

This has not been studied thoroughly in primates, however, and it is not known how MITN are associated with the “orbital” and “medial” prefrontal networks. This study examined the connections of MITN in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Experiments with retrograde and anterograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) showed that MITN are strongly connected with the medial prefrontal network. The dorsal nuclei of the midline thalamus, including the paraventricular (Pa) and parataenial nuclei (Pt), had heavy connections with medial network areas 25, 32, and 14c in the subgenual region. Areas 13a and 12o, which are associated with both networks, were strongly connected with the Pt and the central intermedial nucleus, respectively. Otherwise, orbital network areas had weak connections with MITN. Anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline thalamus resulted in heavy terminal labeling in the medial prefrontal network, most notably in areas ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum (25, 32, and 14c), but also in adjacent areas (13a and 13b). Retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline labeled similar areas. The medial network, particularly the subgenual region, is involved in visceral and emotional control and has been implicated in mood disorders. The strong connections between the subgenual cortex and the Pa provide a pathway through which stress signals from the Pa may influence these prefrontal circuits. J. Comp.

Attention focused on the routes taken by these projections, which were delineated by combining surgical tract section with the placement of a tracer. Projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei almost exclusively used the fornix. These relatively light projections, which arose from all areas of the entorhinal cortex, from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and area 35 of the perirhinal cortex, terminated mainly in the anterior ventral nucleus. In contrast, the projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus from the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum were denser than those to the anterior thalamic nuclei. The projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus used two routes. While nearly all of the projections from the subicular complex used the fornix, many of the entorhinal cortex projections passed caudally in the temporopulvinar bundle to reach the lateral dorsal nucleus. The perirhinal cortex, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also projects to nucleus medialis dorsalis. These projections exclusively used the external capsule and thence the inferior thalamic peduncle. Other temporal-thalamic projections included those to the medial pulvinar, via the temporopulvinar bundle, from the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and those to the paraventricular nucleus from the entorhinal cortex. By identifying these routes, it is possible to appreciate how different lesions might disconnect temporal–diencephalic pathways and so contribute to memory disorders.",,

This report focuses on posterolateral thalamus, where prior anterograde tracing observations identified the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMpo) as the major projection target of lamina I STT neurons. Large injections in posterolateral thalamus labeled predominantly STT cells in lamina I throughout the spinal cord. In cases with medium-sized or small injections centered in VMpo, almost all labeled STT cells (∼90%) were lamina I neurons. Small injections revealed a posteroanterior (foot to hand) somatotopographic organization consistent with that observed in prior anterograde tracing work; injections in posterior VMpo labeled primarily lumbosacral lamina I cells, whereas injections placed more anteriorly in VMpo labeled primarily cervical lamina I cells. These findings support the concept that VMpo is a primate lamina I spinothalamocortical relay nucleus important for pain, temperature, itch, muscle ache, sensual touch, and other interoceptive feelings from the body, and they provide strong evidence for the general hypothesis that the STT consists of several functionally and anatomically differentiable components.

We have examined specific zones of the IPL by injecting eight monkeys with retrogradely transported HRP, and located the positive cells in the thalamic sections with the assistance of an X-Y plotter and reference to the atlas of Olszewski ('52). Projections to the IPL were found in the following thalamic nuclei: Anterior (Anterior Medial, Anterior Ventral); Lateral (Ventral Anterior, Ventral Anterior magnocellularis, Ventral Lateral caudalis, Pulvinar oralis, medialis, lateralis and inferior, Lateral Posterior and Lateral Dorsal); Medial (Medialis Dorsalis densocellularis, parvocellularis, and multiformis); Midline and Intralaminar (Centralis densocellularis, Centralis lateralis, Centralis inferior, Centralis superior lateralis, Subfascicularis parvocellularis, Paracentralis and Parafascicularis); and Posterior (Limitans, Suprageniculatus and Geniculatus Medialis magnocellularis). A major projection to the superior portion of the IPL was from the anterior nuclei and Paracentralis of the intralaminar group. Ventralis Lateralis and oral Pulvinar projected primarily to the anterior-inferior portion of the IPL, whereas Lateral Posterior projected most strongly to the anterior and superior portion. The major projection of the lateral Pulvinar was to the mid-superior portion of the IPL and to area 19. The projections of the inferior Fulvinar were heaviest to area 19, but there was some overlap in the mid-superior portion of the IPL with the medial and lateral Pulvinar. The major projection from the posterior thalamic nuclear complex was to the mid-IPL. The heterogeneous input from the thalamus to the IPL was not anticipated on the basis of prior anterograde or retrograde degeneration studies, and suggests that classical subdivisions of specific and associational thalamic nuclei should be revised with the axonal transport methods of study.",,

In this work, a complete characterization of NA axons and Alpha adrenoceptors distributions is provided. NA axons, revealed by immunohistochemistry against the synthesizing enzyme and the NA transporter, are present in all thalamic nuclei. The most densely innervated ones are the midline nuclei, intralaminar nuclei (paracentral and parafascicular), and the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDm). The ventral motor nuclei and most somatosensory relay nuclei receive a moderate NA innervation. The pulvinar complex receives a heterogeneous innervation. The lateral geniculate nucleus (GL) has the lowest NA innervation. Alpha adrenoceptors were analyzed by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Alpha-1 receptor densities are higher than Alpha-2 densities. Overall, axonal densities and Alpha adrenoceptor densities coincide; although some mismatches were identified. The nuclei with the highest Alpha-1 values are MDm, the parvocellular part of the ventral posterior medial nucleus, medial pulvinar, and midline nuclei. The nucleus with the lowest Alpha-1 receptor density is GL. Alpha-2 receptor densities are highest in the lateral dorsal, centromedian, medial and inferior pulvinar, and midline nuclei. These results suggest a role for NA in modulating thalamic involvement in consciousness, limbic, cognitive, and executive functions.","dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, nonhuman primates, noradrenergic receptors, norepinephrine, norepinephrine transporter",

Synaptic relationships of 17 CB with projection neuron dendrites (PNd) and local circuit neuron dendrites (LCNd) were analyzed in serial ultrathin sections from dorsal and ventral VL regions, which are known to differ cytoarchitecturally and functionally. Three terminals were reconstructed using three-dimensional (3D) computer image analysis techniques to obtain volumetric and planar measurements. CB in the ventral VL were often flat and elongated with synaptic vesicles arranged in clusters. Each CB was engaged with one PNd and one to four LCNd. A single bouton formed 8–50 synaptic contacts, with those on PNd outnumbering the ones on LCNd 4.1∶1. Only some CB in the ventral VL were engaged in complex synaptic arrangements such as triads and serial synapses. Most CB in the dorsal VL displayed a roundish shape and numerous uniformly distributed synaptic vesicles. They formed 5–25 synaptic contacts with a 3∶1 ratio of contacts on PNd compared with those on LCNd. CB in the dorsal VL participated in a variety of complex synaptic arrangements. Two types of triads were found: classic with CB, PNd and LCNd, and unconventional with CB and two LCNd. CB were also involved in serial synapses with two LCNd or LCNd and another PNd, and serial sequential synapses with two LCNd and a PNd. Three glomerulus-like structures were encountered in the dorsal VL. 3D reconstruction and volumetric measurements revealed that synaptic contacts formed by CB on PNd had varying shapes and sizes (0.022–0.274 μm2). Synapses formed on LCNd were larger (0.09–0.407 μm2). The total area of all active zones of a single CB on LCNd was either equal to or about 40% smaller than that of synapses on PNd. The entire active zone area comprised 1–1.6% of the total CB surface area and did not seem to correlate with the volume. Synaptic contacts formed by associated LCNd on PNd in complex arrangements were usually small (0.021–0.044 μm2). The results suggest that: synapses formed by CB on PNd and LCNd, and synapses formed by LCNd on PNd may differ in strength; a variety of different circuits participate in the processing of cerebellar afferent information in the primate VL; and these circuits differ in functionally different VL subdivisions.",,

Comp. Neurol.262:331–364, ′87), was analyzed by using neuroanatomical tracing, immunocytochemical, and quantitative morphometric techniques. The VL nucleus contains nerve cells of two types. Multipolar neurons (PN) retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the precentral gyrus display a tufted branching pattern of the proximal dendrites and have a range of soma areas from 200 to 1,000 μm2 (mean 535.2 μm2, SD = 159.5). Small glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactive cells (LCN) exhibit sizes from 65 to 210 μm2 (mean 122.5 μm2, SD = 32.8) and remain unlabeled after cortical injections. The two cell types can be further distinguished by ultrastructural features. Unlike PN, LCN display little perikaryal cytoplasm, a small irregularly shaped nucleolus, and synaptic vesicles in proximal dendrites. The ratio of PN to LCN is 3:1. The LCN dendrites establish synaptic contacts on PN somata and all levels of dendritic arbor either singly or as a part of complex synaptic arrangements. They are also presynaptic to other LCN dendrites. Terminals known as LR type, i.e., large boutons containing round vesicles, are the most conspicuous in the neuropil. They form asymmetric contacts on somata and proximal dendrites of PN as well as on distal dendrites of LCN. The areas of these boutons range from 0.7 to 12 μm2 and the appositional length on PN dendrites ranges from 1.1 to 14 μm. All LR boutons except the largest ones become anterogradely labeled from large WGA-HRP injections in the deep cerebellar nuclei. These boutons are also encountered as part of triads and glomeruli, but very infrequently since the latter complex synaptic arrangements are rare. The most numerous axon terminals in the neuropil are the SR type, i.e., small terminals (mean area 0.42 μm2) containing round vesicles. The SR boutons become anterogradely labeled after WGA-HRP injections in the precentral gyrus. They form distinct asymmetric contacts predominantly on distal PN and LCN dendrites; however, their domain partially overlaps that of LR boutons at intermediate levels of PN dendrites. The SR boutons are components of serial synapses with LCN dendrites which, in turn, contact somata and all levels of dendritic arbors of PN. They also participate in complex arrangements that consist of sequences of LCN dendrites, serial synapses, and occasional boutons with symmetric contacts. These structures termed small glomeruli are much more frequent in the monkey VL than classic glomeruli with LR boutons. The third group is composed of boutons known as F1 type. This is a heterogeneous population containing boutons of varying sizes ranging from 0.4 to 9 μm2. The terminals contain pleomorphic or almost cylindrical vesicles and display symmetric contacts. The F1 boutons form axosomatic and axodendritic synapses on both types of cells, and axoaxonic synapses on initial axon segments of PN. It is these boutons that participate in complex synaptic arrangements with vesicle-containing LCN dendrites and SR boutons, and they are also encountered as part of triads with three symmetric contacts. Representatives of this bouton population display positive GAD immunoreactivity. For measurements of the membrane and apposing structures, the identified PN dendrites were grouped into three categories. The group of “secondary” dendrites included all consecutive-order short dendritic segments within approximately a 60 μm radius around the soma where most of the branching occurred. It was found that the ratios of boutons with asymmetric contacts to those with symmetric contacts were 4:1 on primary dendrites, 9:1 on “secondary,” and 55:1 on distal dendrites. The ratios of symmetric dendrodendritic synapses to symmetric contacts formed by axon terminals were 3:1 on primary and “secondary” dendrites and 1:1 on distal dendrites. This suggests the overall predominance of excitatory inputs (LR and SR boutons) on PN dendrites with inhibitory inputs coming mainly from GABAergic LCN dendrites. Comparison of the present findings with earlier data on the cerebellar thelamic territory in the cat and the nigrothalamic territory in the monkey suggests significant interspecies and internuclear differences in the organization of mtor thalamic circuits.",,

They were: two antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), one polyclonal and one monoclonal; and a polyclonal antibody against the vesicular transporter of acetylcholine (VAChT), a powerful new marker that colocalizes with ChAT. This approach led to an unexpected finding: the three antibodies positively immunostained a population of neurons in the paracentral nucleus. The immunostained cells are confined to the dorsal region of this nucleus along its rostrocaudal extent. Measurement of the somatic areas of the immunostained neurons indicated that they correspond to a population of large neurons thought to be projection neurons.

The extreme posterior and anterior margins of the S-I hand, foot and face areas receive input from neuron populations which are not as widely separated in the anteroposterior dimension of VP as the neurons projecting to the extreme anterior and posterior margins of the proximal limb and trunk representations in S-I.

Using a stereptaxic method, microelectrodes were inserted through the contralateral hemisphere in order to make electrolytic lesions of the superior colliculus. Large lesions involved all layers of the superior colliculus, while smaler lesions involved either the superficial or the deep layers of the superior colliculus. Following various survival times, the brains were prepared with the Fink-Heimer technique (1967). Following lesions of the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, definite degenerated axonal endings were found in the dorsal and ventral lateral genuculate nuclei, inferior pulvinar, centrontermediate nucleus, magnocellular dorsomedial nucleus, anterior pretectal nucleus and pretectal refion. Sparse degenerated axonal endings were found in the limitans nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus and some intralaminar nuclei following lesions of the superficial layers in the rostral portion of the superior colliculus.

A V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size is larger at lower stimulus contrast. A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the size tuning of V1 cells. We recently demonstrated that V1 horizontal connections integrate signals within a region of the RF center corresponding to the V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size at low contrast; extrastriate feedback connections to V1, instead, are longer range and can integrate signals from the most distant regions of the V1 cell's RF surround. Here, we have determined the contribution of geniculocortical feedforward and corticogeniculate feedback connections to the size-tuning of macaque V1 and lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons, respectively. Specifically, we have quantitatively compared the visuotopic extent of geniculate feedforward afferents to V1 with the size of the RF center and surround of neurons in the V1 input layers and the visuotopic extent of V1 feedback connections to the LGN with the RF size of cells in V1 layer 6, where these connections originate. We find geniculate feedforward connections to provide visuotopic information to V1 that is spatially coextensive with the V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size measured with high-contrast gratings. V1 feedback connections restrict their influence to an LGN region visuotopically coextensive with the size of the minimum response field (or classical RF) of V1 layer 6 cells and commensurate with the LGN region from which they receive feedforward connections.

Here we test this hypothesis using immunohistochemistry against the dopamine transporter (DAT) in adult macaque and rat brains. The extent and density of DAT-immunoreactive (-ir) axons were remarkably greater in the macaque dorsal thalamus, where the mediodorsal association nucleus and the ventral motor nuclei held the densest immunolabeling. In contrast, sparse DAT immunolabeling was present in the rat dorsal thalamus; it was mainly located in the mediodorsal, paraventricular, ventral medial, and ventral lateral nuclei. The reticular nucleus, zona incerta, and lateral habenular nucleus held numerous DAT-ir axons in both species. Ultrastructural analysis in the macaque mediodorsal nucleus revealed that thalamic interneurons are a main postsynaptic target of DAT-ir axons; this suggests that the marked expansion of the dopamine innervation in the primate in comparison to the rodent thalamus may be related to the presence of a sizable interneuron population in primates. We remark that it is important to be aware of brain species differences when using animal models of human brain disease.","dopamine, macaque, rat, species differences, thalamus",

These projections form core components of the Papez circuit, which is vital for normal memory. The study revealed a complex pattern of subicular efferents, consistent with the presence of different, parallel information streams, whose segregation appears more marked in the rat brain. In both species, the cells projecting to the mammillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei showed laminar separation but also differed along other hippocampal axes. In the rat, these diencephalic inputs showed complementary topographies in the proximal–distal (columnar) plane, consistent with differential involvement in object‐based (proximal subiculum) and context‐based (distal subiculum) information. The medial mammillary inputs, which arose along the anterior–posterior extent of the rat subiculum, favoured the central subiculum (septal hippocampus) and the more proximal subiculum (temporal hippocampus). In contrast, anterior thalamic inputs were largely confined to the dorsal (i.e. septal and intermediate) subiculum, where projections to the anteromedial nucleus favoured the proximal subiculum while those to the anteroventral nucleus predominantly arose in the distal subiculum. In the macaque, the corresponding diencephalic inputs were again distinguished by anterior–posterior topographies, as subicular inputs to the medial mammillary bodies predominantly arose from the posterior hippocampus while subicular inputs to the anteromedial thalamic nucleus predominantly arose from the anterior hippocampus. Unlike the rat, there was no clear evidence of proximal–distal separation as all of these medial diencephalic projections preferentially arose from the more distal subiculum.","anatomy, fornix, hippocampus, memory, subiculum",

Each pathway processes information relevant to directed reaching tasks, but whereas VPLc receives its major input from the spinal cord and external environment, the primary afferent to the pulvinar is cortical. Using combined tracer and thick fixed slice procedures, the soma/dendritic morphology of TC neuron populations (with known destination) was shown to be quantitatively similar within VPLc and the pulvinar. This implies that differences in information processing in VPLc (a primary relay) and the pulvinar (an integrative thalamic nucleus) are not defined by a distinctive TC morphology, but rather by the connections of these neuron populations. Two morphologically distinct types of CT axon were observed within the medial pulvinar and VPLc. The more common “Type E” were fine, had boutons en passant and diffuse terminal bifurcations ending in masses of tiny boutons. “Type R” axons were thicker, smooth, and terminated in localised clusters of large terminal boutons. Each type had a unique pattern of termination reflecting a distinct action on target neuron populations. The spatial relationship between TC distribution territories and CT terminal fields was examined within the medial pulvinar and VPLc by using anterograde and retrograde tracers injected together within cortical areas 7a, and 3b/1, respectively. Spatial overlap was incomplete within both thalamic nuclei. Our findings show a more complex relationship between TC and CT neuron populations than previously demonstrated. J. Comp.

The ventroposterior medial sub-nucleus (VPM) for touch was identified as separate from the ventroposterior medial parvicellular nucleus (VPMpc) for taste by differential expression of several types of proteins. Our results revealed somatotopically matched projections from VPM to the part of 3b representing intra-oral structures and the face. Retrogradely labeled cells resulting from injections in area 3b were also found in other thalamic nuclei including: anterior pulvinar (Pa), ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior superior (VPS), ventroposterior lateral (VPL), ventral lateral (VL), centre médian (CM), central lateral (CL), and medial dorsal (MD). None of our injections, including those into the representation of the tongue, labeled neurons in VPMpc, the thalamic taste nucleus.

Field potential investigation,"In order to investigate the thalamic relay of the vestibulo-cortical pathway, field potentials were recorded in the rhesus thalamus under pentobarbital anesthesia. Short latency responses (2.5 msec on the average) upon stimulation in isolation of the vestibular nerve were recorded in the inferior ventroposterior nucleus (VPI). These potentials were abolished after transection of the vestibular nerve but were not affected by total cerebellectomy. Projection of VPI neurons to the primary vestibular cortex was demonstrated by antidromic stimulation. Field potentials with latencies of those observed in the vestibular cortex (about 5 msec) in response to vestibular nerve stimulation were recorded in other areas of the thalamus (ventrobasal, ventrolateral, posterior group, including magnocellular medial geniculate nuclei). Thus, the VPI rather than the other nuclei with long latency responses is likely to be the thalamic relay in the vestibulo-cortical path. The close topographical relationship between vestibular and somatic areas in the cortex is parallelled in the thalamus, the VPI being closely related to VPL and VPM nuclei.",,

Organization of nigrothalamic afferents as revealed with EM autoradiography,"An EM-autoradiographic technique was used to identify the ultrastructural features and synaptic sites of nigral afferents to the ventral anterior nucleus pars magnocellularis (V Amc) of the rhesus monkey thalamus. The findings demonstrate that the nigral boutons are of medium-sized to large, with the majority being of the en passant type. These boutons form symmetric synaptic contacts, and contain pleomorphic or entirely flat vesicles and numerous mitochondria. The nigral input is heavily biased towards thalamocortical projection neurons (PN), whose somata and dendrites represent about 82% of the postsynaptic sites of labeled boutons. The distal dendrites of local circuit neurons (LCN) comprise 13% of the postsynaptic sites. Nigral terminals appear to represent a single extrinsic afferent input to the somata and primary dendrites of thalamocortical projection neurons. A nigral input to LCN somata was not demonstrated but the possibility could not be excluded. Although the basic ultrastructural features of nigral boutons in the monkey are similar to those described earlier in the cat (Kultas-Ilinsky et al.: J. Comp.

Transneuronal atrophy occurred in neurons of the dorsal column (DCN) and ventral posterior lateral thalamic (VPL) nuclei in monkeys subjected to cervical and upper thoracic dorsal rhizotomies for 13–21 years and that had shown extensive representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex and thalamus in other experiments. Volumes of DCN and VPL, number and sizes of neurons, and neuronal packing density were measured by unbiased stereological techniques. When compared with the opposite, unaffected, side, the ipsilateral cuneate nucleus (CN), external cuneate nucleus (ECN), and contralateral VPL showed reductions in volume: 44–51% in CN, 37–48% in ECN, and 32–38% in VPL. In the affected nuclei, neurons were progressively shrunken with increasing survival time, and their packing density increased, but there was relatively little loss of neurons (10–16%). There was evidence for loss of axons of atrophic CN cells in the medial lemniscus and in the thalamus, with accompanying severe disorganization of the parts of the ventral posterior nuclei representing the normally innervated face and the deafferented upper limb. Secondary transneuronal atrophy in VPL, associated with retraction of axons of CN neurons undergoing primary transneuronal atrophy, is likely to be associated with similar withdrawal of axons from the cerebral cortex and should be a powerful influence on reorganization of somatotopic maps in the somatosensory cortex.","plasticity, dorsal rhizotomy, transneuronal atrophy, dorsal column nuclei, ventral posterior lateral nucleus, stereology",

These afferents may arise from neocortex or from subcortical centers; however, their exact distribution, segregation, or putative absence in given thalamic nuclei are unknown. To unravel the nucleus-specific composition of drivers, we mapped the entire macaque thalamus using vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 to label cortical and subcortical afferents, respectively. Large thalamic territories were innervated exclusively by either giant vGLUT2- or vGLUT1-positive boutons. Codistribution of drivers with different origin was not abundant. In several thalamic regions, no giant terminals of any type could be detected at light microscopic level. Electron microscopic observation of these territories revealed either the complete absence of large multisynaptic excitatory terminals (basal ganglia-recipient nuclei) or the presence of both vGLUT1- and vGLUT2-positive terminals, which were significantly smaller than their giant counterparts (intralaminar nuclei, medial pulvinar). In the basal ganglia-recipient thalamus, giant inhibitory terminals replaced the excitatory driver inputs. The pulvinar and the mediodorsal nucleus displayed subnuclear heterogeneity in their driver assemblies. These results show that distinct thalamic territories can be under pure subcortical or cortical control; however, there is significant variability in the composition of major excitatory inputs in several thalamic regions. Because thalamic information transfer depends on the origin and complexity of the excitatory inputs, this suggests that the computations performed by individual thalamic regions display considerable variability. Finally, the map of driver distribution may help to resolve the morphological basis of human diseases involving different parts of the thalamus.",,

In labeling experiments, four macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received injections of biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into the cerebellar nuclei or internal segment of the globus pallidus and cervical segments of the spinal cord, respectively. Each tracer was visualized in brain sections by sequentially using a different chromogen. Labeled terminals were plotted and superimposed on adjacent brain sections processed for Nissl substance, acetylcholinesterase, and the antigens for calbindin and Cat-301 to reveal thalamic nuclei. The labeled cerebellar terminals were distributed throughout the posterior VL (VLp), whereas the labeled pallidothalamic terminals were concentrated in the anterior VL and the ventral anterior nucleus. The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it. In addition, the patches of spinothalamic terminations intermingled and partly overlapped with the cerebellothalamic, but not with the pallidothalamic terminations within VLp. The regions of overlap of somatosensory and cerebellar inputs within the VLp of the present study appear to correspond to the reported locations of the tremor-related cells in parkinsonian patients. Thus, the overlapping spinothalamic and cerebellar inputs may provide a substrate for the altered activity of motor thalamic neurons in such patients. J. Comp.

The source of the thalamic projections from the medial mammillary nucleus showed strikingly different patterns of organization depending on the site of the injection within the two anterior thalamic nuclei, anterior medialis and anterior ventralis. These data reveal at least two distinct modes by which the primate medial mammillary bodies can regulate anterior thalamic function. Projections to the thalamic nucleus anterior medialis arise mainly from the pars lateralis of the medial mammillary nucleus. A particularly dense source is the dorsal cap in the posterior half of the pars lateralis, a subregion that has not previously been distinguished. In contrast, neurons spread evenly across the medial mammillary nucleus gave rise to projections more laterally in the anterior thalamic nuclei. A third pattern of medial mammillary neurons appeared to provide the source of projections to the rostral midline thalamic nuclei. In contrast, the labeled cells in the lateral mammillary nucleus were evenly spread across that nucleus, irrespective of injection site. In addition to the established projection to anterior dorsalis, the lateral mammillary nucleus appears to project lightly to a number of other thalamic nuclei, including lateralis dorsalis, anterior medialis, anterior ventralis, and the rostral midline nuclei, e.g. nucleus reuniens. These anatomical findings not only reveal novel ways of grouping the neurons within the medial mammillary nucleus, but also indicate that the mammillothalamic connections support cognition in multiple ways.",,

The following findings were obtained. The superficial thalamocortical (T-C) projections, terminating in the (superficial half of) cortical layer I, arise mainly from the nucleus ventralis anterior, pars principalis (VApc) and nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and possibly from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis (VLm) and nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc). The VApc gives rise to the superficial T-C and deep T-C projections onto the postarcuate premotor area around the arcuate genu and spur, and onto the dorsomedial part of the caudal premotor area as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA). The VApc also gives rise to only deep T-C projections onto the remaining premotor area and onto the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus as well as the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level of the premotor area. The VLo gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the ventrolateral part of the motor area (mainly to the forelimb motor area) and onto the dorsomedial part to the mesial cortex at the rostral level of the motor area. The VAmc gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the banks of the arcuate genu and adjacent region of area 8. Area X, the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc), nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and possibly the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) send only deep T-C projections. The dorsal and medial parts of the VLc project onto the premotor area, the rostral part of the motor area and the SMA, and also the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Area X projects onto the premotor area, the SMA, and the caudal part of area 8.

The results show that medium to large caliber DLG axons end in discontinuous terminal ‘patches’ in layers V and lower IV of extrastriate cortex. There is a topographical organization to these projections which are mainly to area 19 and anterior 18 located on the lateral and medial surfaces of the hemisphere. Apparently there are no DLG projections to any of the cortical subdivisions located within the lunate and superior temporal sulci.,,

In an effort to shed light on the neuroanatomical organization of the PMC, we undertook a study to identify and analyze the thalamocortical connections of these cortices. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in the posterior cingulate (PCC), retrosplenial (RSC), medial parietal cortices (MPC) and posterior cingulate sulcus (PCS), and the labeling patterns within the thalamus were analyzed. Three afferent projection patterns were observed to the PMC from the thalamus: a PCC/RSC pattern that involved the anterior thalamic nuclei, a MPC pattern that involved the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei and a PCS pattern that involved the ventral thalamic nuclei. Additionally, a shared pattern of projections from the anterior intralaminar nuclei (AILN) and posterior thalamic nuclei (PTN) to all cortical regions of the PMC was observed. Our findings suggest that distinct regions within the PMC are supplied by distinctive patterns of thalamic input, but also share common projections from intralaminar and posterior thalamic sources. In addition, we relate our findings to functional abnormalities in aging and dementia, and address a domain-like pattern of thalamocortical labeling of the PMC that is drawn selectively and collectively from multiple thalamic nuclei.","thalamus, medial parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, neuroanatomy",

An anterograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline thalamus revealed strong projections to the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus. Retrograde tracer injections into these areas labeled neurons specifically in Pa. Following a retrograde tracer injection into Pa, labeled neurons were found in the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and periaqueductal gray. Pa contained a remarkably high density of axons and axonal varicosities immunoreactive for serotonin (5-HT) and orexin/hypocretin (ORX), as well as a moderate density of fibers immunoreactive for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). A retrograde tracer injection into Pa combined with immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ORX and 5-HT axons originate from neurons in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Pa-projecting neurons were localized in the same nuclei of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain as CRH neurons, although no double-labeling was found. The connections of Pa and its innervation by 5-HT, ORX, and CRH suggest that it may relay stress signals between the midbrain and hypothalamus with the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, and subgenual cortex, as part of a circuit that manages stress and possibly stress-related psychopathologies.","stress, depression, mood disorders, amygdala, accumbens nucleus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, parataenial nucleus, striatum",

To determine the degree of divergence/convergence of thalamocortical projections to mesial [supplementary motor area (SMA)-proper and pre-SMA] and lateral (PMd-c, PMd-r, PMv-c and PMv-r) premotor (PM) subareas, quantitative analyses were performed on the distribution of retrograde labelling after multiple tracer injections in the same animal. The results demonstrate that all PM and SMA subareas receive common inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the relative contribution of these nuclei to thalamocortical projections differs. The largest difference occurs between subareas of SMA, with much greater contribution from the mediodorsal (MD) and area X, and a smaller contribution from the ventral lateral anterior (VLa) and ventral part of the ventral lateral posterior (VLpv) to pre-SMA than to SMA-proper. In PM, differences between subareas are less pronounced; in particular, all receive a significant contribution from MD, the ventral anterior (VApc) and area X. However, there are clear gradients, such as increasing projections from MD to rostral, from VLa and VLpv to caudal, and from dorsal VLp (VLpd) to dorsal premotor subareas. Intralaminar nuclei provide widespread projections to all premotor subareas. The degree of overlap between thalamocortical projections varies among different PM and SMA subareas and different sectors of the thalamus. These variations, which correspond to different origin and topography of thalamocortical projections, are discussed in relation to functional organizations at thalamic and cortical levels.",,

The MITN that project to cingulate cortex have a prominent innervation by norepinephrinergic axons primarily originating from the LC. The hypothesis explored in this study is that MITN neurons that project to cingulate cortex receive a disproportionately high LC input that may modulate nociceptive afferent flow into the forebrain. Ten cynomolgus monkeys were evaluated for dopamine-β hydroxylase (DBH) immunohistochemistry and, nuclei with moderate or high DBH activity were analyzed for intermediate neurofilament proteins, calbindin, and calretinin. Sections of all but DBH were thionin counterstained to assure precise localization in the mediodorsal and MITN and cytoarchitecture was analyzed with neuron-specific nuclear binding protein. Moderate-high levels of DBH-immunoreactive (ir) axons were generally associated with high densities of CB-ir and CR-ir neurons and low levels of neurofilament proteins. The paraventricular, superior centrolateral, limitans and central nuclei had relatively high and evenly distributed DBH, the magnocellular mediodorsal and paracentral nuclei had moderate DBH-ir, and other nuclei had an even and low level of activity. Some nuclei also have heterogeneities in DBH-ir that raised questions of functional segregation. The anterior multiformis part of the mediodorsal nucleus but not middle and caudal levels had high DBH activity. The posterior parafascicular nucleus (Pf) was heterogeneous with the lateral part having little DBH activity, while its medial division had most DBH-ir axons and its multiformis part had only a small number. These findings suggest that the LC may regulate nociceptive processing in the thalamus. The well established role of cingulate cortex in premotor functions and the projections of Pf and other MITN to the limbic striatum suggests a specific role in mediating motor outflow for the LC-innervated nuclei of the MITN.","dopamine-β hydroxylase, cingulate cortex, thalamus, locus coeruleus, stress, pain",

The known connections of areas 4 and 3b differ substantially, as does the information which they receive, process, and transfer to other parts of the central nervous system. In this analysis the thalamic projections to each of these three cortical fields were examined and compared by using retrogradely transported fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, Rhodamine and Green latex microspheres) as neuron labels. Coincident labeling of projections to 2–3 cortical sites in each monkey allowed the direct comparison of the soma distributions within the thalamic space of the different neuron populations projecting to areas 3a, 3b, and 4, as well as to boundary zones between these cortical fields. The soma distribution ofthalamic neurons projecting to a small circumscribed zone (diameter = 0.5–1.0 mm) strictly within cortical area 3a (in region of hand representation) filled out a “territory” traversing the dorsal half of the cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus, VPLc (abbreviations as in Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. Basel: Karger). This elongate, rather cylindrical, territory extended caudally into the anterior pulvinar nucleus, but not forward into VPLo. The rostrocaudal extent of the thalamic territory defining the soma distribution of neurons projecting to small zones of cortical area 3b was similar, but typically extended into the ventral part of VPLc, filling out a medially concavo-convex laminar space. Two such territories projecting to adjacent zones of areas 3a and 3b, respectively, overlapped and shared thalamic space, but not thalamic neurons. Contrasting with the 3a and 3b thalamic territories, the soma distribution of thalamic neurons projecting to a circumscribed zone in the nearby motor cortex (area 4) did not penetrate into VPLc, but instead filled out a mediolaterally flattened territory extending from rostral VLo, VLm, VPLo to caudal and dorsal VLc, LP, and Pulo. These territories skirted around VPLc. All three cortical areas (4, 3a, and 3b) also received input from distinctive clusters of cells in the intralaminar Cn.Md. It is inferred that, in combination, the thalamic territories in areas 3a, 3b, and 4 (and also area 1 and 2), which would be coactive during the execution of a manual task, constituted a lamellar space extending from VLo rostrally to Pul.o caudally. How Pul.o neuron populations relate to the more rostral populations within the same thalamic territory projecting to a localized cortical zone remains uncertain. Within the medially located territories the distribution of the neuron population in Pul.o was spatially continuous with the more rostral thalamic cells projecting to the same localized cortex, but in lateral thalamic territories these 2 populations were usually spatially discontinous. In the newborn macaque an orderly change in the territorial projections to localized zones in area 4, 3a, and 3b was also demonstable. However, thalamic nuclear projections were more expansive than in the mature animal. As well as the VPLc input, a third of the thalamic input to area 3a was now from VLo, VPLo, and VLm. Area 4 also had a significant input from VPLc, an input not observed in the mature macaque. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

These tracers, in combination or separately, were injected into one or more cortical sites, after the skin surface capable of activating neurons at each site had been defined with microelectrode mapping methods. These injection sites were later related to the overall organizations of the two cutaneous representations as determined in more extensive mapping experiments (Nelson et al., 1980). Finally, zones of anterograde and retrograde label in the thalamus were located with reference to architectonically defined subnuclei in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP). The results led to the following conclusions. (1) Zones of cells in VP projecting to a given location in either Area 3b or 1 also receive reciprocal projections from the cortical target. (2) A given cortical location typically relates to a disc-shaped or lamellar region in VP with the disc extending rostrocaudally and dorsoventrally, being most narrow in the mediolateral dimension. (3) The representations of the same body surface in Area 1 and Area 3b relate to the same region of VP. However, since fewer cells were generally labeled after Area 1 injections, less dense terminations are suggested from VP to Area 1 than to Area 3b. (4) VP is the major or exclusive relay of somatosensory information to the two cutaneous representations from the thalamus. Labeled neurons or zones of terminations were found outside VP in other parts of the somatosensory thalamus only when injection sites extended into cortex outside Areas 3b and 1. (5) The face, hand, limbs, and foot are represented in a mediolateral sequence of subnuclei within VP. A dorsal capping subnucleus is apparently largely devoted to the axial trunk and perhaps other hairy skin surfaces such as some parts of the proximal surfaces of the limbs. (6) While anterior and posterior surfaces of the hind limb are widely separated by the glabrous foot in the cortical representations, they appear to be represented in adjacent zones in the thalamus.",,

In addition, the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the physiologically identified hand/arm representation of SMA. The tissue was processed sequentially using different chromogens in order to visualize all three tracers in a single section. We found that the SMA thalamocortical neurons occupied a wide band extending from the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) through the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars medialis (VLm) and into to the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc) including a portion of ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X. The heaviest CTB labeling was found in VLo with dense plexuses of BDA labeled pallidothalamic fibers and swellings often observed superimposed upon retrogradely labeled CTB cells. In addition, dense foci of cerebellothalamic WGA-HRP anterograde label were observed coinciding with the occasional retrogradely CTB labeled neurons in VLc and transitional zones between VApc, VLo and VPLo.

To not rely on the rough definition of cytoarchitectonic boundaries in the thalamus, monkeys were subjected to multiple injections of tracers (four to seven) in the primary (M1), premotor (PM), and supplementary (SMA) motor cortical areas and in area 46. The cortical areas were distributed into five groups, each receiving inputs from a specific set of thalamic nuclei: 1) M1; 2) SMA-proper and the caudal part of the dorsal PM (PMdc); 3) the rostral and caudal parts of the ventral PM (PMvr and PMvc); 4) the rostral part of the dorsal PM (PMdr); and 5) the superior and inferior parts of area 46 (area 46sup and area 46inf). A major degree of overlap was obtained for the origins of the thalamocortical projections directed to areas 46inf and 46sup and for those terminating in SMA-proper and PMdc. PMvc and PMvr received inputs from adjacent and/or common thalamic regions. In contrast, the degree of overlap between M1 and SMA was smaller. The projection to M1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to PM. Thalamic inputs to the motor cortical areas (M1, SMA, PMd, and PMv), in general, were segregated from those directed to area 46, except in the mediodorsal nucleus, in which there was clear overlap of the territories sending projections to area 46, SMA-proper, and PMdc.

Precuneate areas shared strong input from the posterior thalamus (lateral posterior nucleus and pulvinar complex) and moderate input from the medial, lateral, and intralaminar thalamic regions. Area PGm received strong connections from the subdivisions of the pulvinar linked to association and visual function (the medial and lateral nuclei), whereas areas 31 and PEci received afferents from the oral division of the pulvinar. All three cytoarchitectural areas also received input from subdivisions of the lateral thalamus linked to motor function (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), with area PEci receiving additional input from a subdivision linked to somatosensory function (ventral posterior lateral nucleus). Finally, only PGm received substantial limbic association afferents, mainly via the lateral dorsal nucleus. These results indicate that area PGm integrates information from visual association, motor and limbic regions of the thalamus, in line with a hypothesized role in spatial cognition, including navigation. By comparison, dorsal precuneate areas (31 and PEci) are more involved in sensorimotor functions, being akin to adjacent areas of the dorsal parietal cortex.",,

In each monkey, different fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected separately into the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the primary motor cortex after physiological mapping with intracortical microstimulation. In the same individual monkeys, an anterograde tracer, wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was injected into the internal segment of the globus pallidus after the forelimb part was identified physiologically. A small group of projection neurons to the distal and proximal representations of the motor cortex were found in the terminal fields from the pallidum, but a majority of the projection neurons were distributed outside the terminal area in the thalamus. These results confirm the existence of the pathway from the pallidum through the thalamus to the primary motor cortex, but also indicate that the primary motor cortex receives its major thalamic inputs from outside of the pallidal projection area, and that the pallidum sends its major outputs to nonprimary motor areas through the thalamus. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

We found that neurons in the dorsal and ventral pulvinar, but not the LGN, showed changes in spiking rate according to stimulus visibility. Passive viewing control sessions showed such modulation to be independent of the monkeys' active report. Perceptual suppression was also accompanied by a marked drop in low-frequency power (9–30 Hz) of the local field potential (LFP) throughout the visual thalamus, but this modulation was not observed during passive viewing. Our findings demonstrate that visual responses of pulvinar neurons reflect the perceptual awareness of a stimulus, while those of LGN neurons do not.","vision, LGN, awareness, pulvinar, attention",

Yet, now that many other brain regions have been explored and neurophysiologists are turning to questions of how larger circuits operate, these two characteristics are starting to seem more attractive. First, the relay nature of thalamic neurons means that recording from them, like tapping into a wire, can reveal the signals carried by specific circuits. Second, the concentration of like relay neurons into nuclei means that inactivating or stimulating them can efficiently test the functions of the circuits. Recent studies implementing these principles have revealed pathways through the thalamus that contribute to generating movements and to monitoring one’s own actions (corollary discharge).",DBS; deep brain stimulation; EMG; electromyograph; FEF; frontal eye field; GABA; γ-amino butyric acid; GPi; globus pallidus internal segment; M1; primary motor cortex; MD; mediodorsal; MDmf; mediodorsal nucleus pars multiformis; SC; superior colliculus; SMA; supplementary motor area; VA; ventroanterior; VL; ventrolateral; VPL; ventroposterolateral;,

In the present study, we examined the distribution of cells of origin of thalamocortical projections to the pre-SMA in the macaque monkey. Under the guidance of intracortical microstimulation mapping, the retrograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the pre-SMA.

These areas are richly interconnected by hundreds of reciprocal corticocortical pathways that underlie an anatomically based hierarchy containing multiple processing streams. In addition, there is a complex pattern of reciprocal connections with the pulvinar, which itself contains about 10 architectonically distinct subdivisions. Information flow through these corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits is regulated very dynamically by top-down as well as bottom-up processes, including directed visual attention.

Different patterns of anterograde label in KA were produced by radioactively labeled amino acid injections in the contralateral primary auditory area, the ipsilateral medial geniculate body (MGB), or auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Thalamic afferents from the MGB were found throughout KA in layers IV and III where the density waxed and waned, forming regular patches of higher density label separated by areas of less dense label. Callosal afferents from the contralateral auditory cortices were found in layers IV, III, and II in larger, more spatially separated, and irregular patches. In contrast, association afferents from the auditory association cortex of the STG were found in a continuous band in layer I. To determine the extent to which the patches of callosal afferents overlap with or interdigitate between the high-density thalamic clusters, two types of double anterograde labeling experiments were undertaken. In one set of experiments isotope injections of the MGB were made in conjunction with transection of the corpus callosum in the same animal. In another set of experiments isotope injections of the MGB were made in one hemisphere and an injection of WGA-HRP was made in the opposite supratemporal plane, including KA, in the same animal. Both approaches demonstrate that the patches of callosal afferents in KA mainly occur between the high-density patches of thalamic afferents, although there is a variable degree of overlap at their periphery. Thus it seems that thalamic and callosal inputs to KA are organized in a largely complementary fashion while input from the lateral association cortex is continuous and overlaps both. When considered in light of pertinent anatomical and physiological studies in a variety of species, it appears that the areas mainly occupied by callosal or thalamic inputs may be differentially involved in frequency analysis and sound localization, respectively.",,

In the caudorostral dimension, stepwise serial projections convey information through the primary, rostral, and rostrotemporal (AI, R, and RT) core areas on the supratemporal plane (STP), continuing to the rostrotemporal polar area (RTp) and adjacent auditory-related areas of the rostral superior temporal gyrus (STGr) and temporal pole. In addition to this cascade of corticocortical connections, the auditory cortex receives parallel thalamocortical projections from the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Previous studies have examined the projections from MGN to auditory cortex, but most have focused on the caudal core areas AI and R. In this study, we investigated the full extent of connections between MGN and AI, R, RT, RTp, and STGr using retrograde and anterograde anatomical tracers. Both AI and R received nearly 90% of their thalamic inputs from the ventral subdivision of the MGN (MGv; the primary/lemniscal auditory pathway). By contrast, RT received only ~45% from MGv, and an equal share from the dorsal subdivision (MGd). Area RTp received ~25% of its inputs from MGv, but received additional inputs from multisensory areas outside the MGN (30% in RTp versus 1-5% in core areas). The MGN input to RTp distinguished this rostral extension of auditory cortex from the adjacent auditory-related cortex of the STGr, which received 80% of its thalamic input from multisensory nuclei (primarily medial pulvinar). Anterograde tracers identified complementary descending connections by which highly processed auditory information may modulate thalamocortical inputs.","rhesus, primate, medial geniculate, pulvinar, thalamus, corticothalamic, RRID: AB_10013220, RRID: AB_1502299, RRID: AB_2536200, RRID: AB_477329",

Three tracers were utilized: tritiated leucine, biotinylated dextran amine, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in combination with postembedding immunocytochemsitry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pallidothalamic fibers, upon entering the VAdc, gave off several collaterals that formed plexuses of varicose terminal branches within different cell clusters. The varicosities were aligned along somata and proximal dendrites of projection neurons providing dense input to each individual cell. At the electron microscopic level, labeled boutons displayed a predominantly flat and elongated shape. They contained a moderate number of pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and very large amounts of mitochondria, displayed symmetric synaptic contacts, and were immunoreactive for GABA. In the total sample of 128 autoradiographically labeled terminals, 64% were in synaptic contact with somata and primary dendrites of projection neurons, 14% formed synapses on proximal dendrites of undefined order, and only 7% established synaptic contacts on distal dendrites. Fifteen percent of the labeled boutons established synapses on distal dendrites of GABAergic local circuit neurons (LCN). Pallidal boutons were also found in complex synaptic arrangements: triads with three GABAergic synapses, and serial synapses with LCN dendrites that in turn established synaptic contacts on projection neuron somata or dendrites. These anatomical results suggest a dual effect of pallidal afferents to projection neurons: direct inhibition and disinhibition mediated by LCN. The findings indicate that the fine structure of pallidothalamic terminals in the monkey is similar to that described earlier in the cat. There are, however, interspecies differences in the distribution of pallidal input on postsynaptic targets and its participation in complex synaptic arrangements. J. Comp.

Reorganization results in expansion of intact chin inputs, which reactivate neurons in the deafferented hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b), ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. A likely contributing mechanism for this large-scale plasticity is sprouting of axons across the hand–face border. Here we determined whether such sprouting takes place in area 3b. We first determined the extent of intrinsic corticocortical connectivity between the hand and the face representations in normal area 3b. Small amounts of neuroanatomical tracers were injected in these representations close to the electrophysiologically determined hand–face border. Locations of the labeled neurons were mapped with respect to the detailed electrophysiological somatotopic maps and histologically determined hand–face border revealed in sections of the flattened cortex stained for myelin. Results show that intracortical projections across the hand–face border are few. In monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns and expanded chin representation, connections across the hand–face border were not different compared with normal monkeys. Thalamocortical connections from the hand and face representations in the ventroposterior nucleus to area 3b also remained unaltered after injury. The results show that sprouting of intrinsic connections in area 3b or the thalamocortical inputs does not contribute to large-scale cortical plasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Long-term injuries to dorsal spinal cord in adult primates result in large-scale somatotopic reorganization due to which chin inputs expand into the deafferented hand region. Reorganization takes place in multiple cortical areas, and thalamic and medullary nuclei. To what extent this brain reorganization due to dorsal column injuries is related to axonal sprouting is not known. Here we show that reorganization of primary somatosensory area 3b is not accompanied with either an increase in intrinsic cortical connections between the hand and face representations, or any change in thalamocortical inputs to these areas. Axonal sprouting that causes reorganization likely takes place at subthalamic levels.","brain reorganization, dorsal columns, Macaca, plasticity, ventroposterior nucleus",

Iontophoretic injections guided by physiological recordings were restricted to lamina I or laminae I–II. PHA-L-labeled trigemino- and spinothalamic (TSTT) terminations were identified immunohistochemically. TRITC- and FITC-labeled dextrans were injected at different levels to confirm topography. Terminations consistently occurred in two main locations: a distinguishable portion of posterolateral thalamus identified cytoarchitectonically as the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) and a portion of posteromedial thalamus designated as the ventral caudal part of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDvc). In addition, isolated fibers bearing boutons of passage were observed in the ventral posterior medial and lateral (VPM and VPL) nuclei, and spinal terminations occurred in the ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI). Isolated terminations occasionally occurred in other sites (e.g., suprageniculate, zona incerta, hypothalamic paraventricular n.). Terminations in MDvc occurred in concise foci that were weakly organized topographically (posteroanterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo consisted of dense clusters of ramified terminal arbors bearing multiple large boutons that were well organized topographically (anteroposterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo colocalized with a field of calbindin-immunoreactive terminal fibers; double-labeled terminals were documented at high magnification. This propitious marker was especially useful at anterior levels, where VMpo can easily be misidentified as VPM. These findings demonstrate phylogenetically novel primate lamina I TSTT projections important for sensory and motivational aspects of pain, temperature, itch, muscle ache, sensual touch, and other interoceptive feelings from the body.

However, little is known about the histaminergic innervation of visual areas, or the histamine system in the primate brain, in general. We examined in Macaca mulatta the location of histamine-immunoreactive neurons and the innervation of important cortical and subcortical visual areas by histamine-immunoreactive axons. Brain sections were treated with an antibody to histamine and processed with standard immunohistological procedures. Histamine-immunoreactive neurons (20–45 μm in diameter) were localized bilaterally in the hypothalamus, particularly in ventral, lateral, posterior, and perimammillary hypothalamic areas. These hypothalamic cells appear to provide the sole neural source of histamine in the macaque brain. A plexus of varicose histamine-immunoreactive axons was present throughout the superior colliculus, the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the lateral posterior/pulvinar complex, and the visual cortex, including areas 17, 18, and the nearby extrastriate cortex. The axons nearly homogeneously innervated every region and layer in these structures, except for an increase in density in layer 1 of the visual cortex and in the superficial-most layers of the superior colliculus. Histaminergic axons broadly innervated every visual region examined. In comparison with the other aminergic and the cholinergic projection systems, which show considerable projection specificity, the histaminergic projection exhibited great homogeneity. The breadth of the distribution of histaminergic axons ensures that virtually all levels of visual processing in the primate can be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the neuromodulatory effects of histamine. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

A Review,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OfC) is a heterogeneous prefrontal sector selectively connected with a wide constellation of other prefrontal, limbic, sensory and premotor areas. Among the limbic cortical connections, the ones with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are particularly salient. Sensory cortices connected with the OfC include areas involved in olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. Subcortical structures with prominent OfC connections include the amygdala, numerous thalamic nuclei, the striatum, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, and biochemically specific cell groups in the basal forebrain and brainstem. Architectonic and connectional evidence supports parcellation of the OfC. The rostrally placed isocortical sector is mainly connected with isocortical areas, including sensory areas of the auditory, somatic and visual modalities, whereas the caudal non-isocortical sector is principally connected with non-isocortical areas, and, in the sensory domain, with olfactory and gustatory areas. The connections of the isocortical and non-isocortical orbital sectors with the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter are also specific. The medial sector of the OfC is selectively connected with the hippocampus, posterior parahippocampal cortex, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial areas, and area prostriata, while the lateral orbitofrontal sector is the most heavily connected with sensory areas of the gustatory, somatic and visual modalities, with premotor regions, and with the amygdala.",,

Yet, the distribution of GABAB receptors in the thalamus has only been studied in the rat, and there is no comparable information in primates. The potent GABAB receptor antagonist [3H]CGP 62349 was used to study the distribution and binding properties of the receptor in control monkeys and those with small ibotenic acid lesions in the anterodorsal segment of the nucleus reticularis thalami. Eight-micrometer-thick cryostat sections of the fresh frozen brains were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the ligand. Autoradiographs were analysed using a quantitative image analysis technique, and binding parameters were calculated for select thalamic nuclei as well as basal ganglia structures present in the same sections. The overall number of GABAB binding sites in the monkey thalamus and basal ganglia was several-fold higher than previously reported values for the rat. In the thalamus, the receptors were distributed rather uniformly and the binding densities and affinities were high (Bmax range of 245.5–437.9 fmol/mg of tissue, Kd range of 0.136–0.604 nM). In the basal ganglia, the number of binding sites and the affinities were lower (Bmax range of 51.1–244.2 fmol/mg of tissue; Kd range of 0.416–1.394 nM), and the differences between nuclei were more pronounced, with striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta displaying the highest binding densities. Seven days post-lesion, a 20–30% decrease in Bmax values (P<0.05) was found in the nuclei receiving input from the lesioned nucleus reticularis thalami sector (the mediodorsal nucleus and densicellular and magnocellular parts of the ventral anterior nucleus) without changes in affinity. No significant changes were detected in any other structures. The results of the lesioning experiments suggest that a portion of thalamic GABAB receptors is in a presynaptic location on the nucleus reticularis thalami efferents. The overall distribution pattern in the thalamus also suggests a partial association of GABAB receptors with corticothalamic terminals presynaptically.","quantitative autoradiography; presynaptic GABA receptors; inhibitory circuits; reticulothalamic afferents; primates; AM, anteromedial nucleus; AV, anteroventral nucleus; Bmax, maximum density of binding sites; Cd, caudate; CM, centromedian nucleus; GPl, lateral globus pallidus; GPm, medial globus pallidus; Kd, dissociation constant; LCN, local circuit neurons; LD, laterodorsal nucleus; LH, lateral habenula nucleus; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; MG, medial geniculate complex; MH, medial habenula nucleus; NRT, nucleus reticularis thalami; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; Pul, pulvinar complex; SN, substantia nigra; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr, substantia nigra pars reticularis; STN, subthalamic nuclues; VAdc, ventral anterior nucleus pars densicellularis; VAmc, ventral anterior nucleus pars magnocellularis; VL, ventral lateral nucleus; VPl, ventroposterior lateral nucleus; VPm, ventroposterior medial nucleus;",

Inhibitory synaptic terminals in the VPL were defined as those that contain flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and that can be shown to be immunoreactive for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There are two types of these profiles: F axon terminals that arise from neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus, and perhaps from VPL local circuit neurons (LCNs); and the dendritic appendages of LCNs that form presynaptic dendrites (PSDs). ML terminals normally have extensive synaptic interactions with PSDs but not with F axon terminals. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that cuneatus lesions resulted in a rapid loss of ML terminals and a statistically significant reduction in both F and PSD synaptic profiles. Confocal scanning microscopy also demonstrated a profound loss of GABA immunoreactivity in the deafferented VPL. These changes persisted for more than 20 weeks, without any evidence of reactive synaptogenesis of surviving sensory afferents or of inhibitory synapses. The changes in GABA circuitry are transneuronal, and the possible mechanisms that may underlie them are discussed. It is suggested that the altered GABAergic circuitry of the VPL in the monkey may serve as a model for understanding changes in somatic sensation in the human following peripheral or central deafferentation. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Each injection resulted in anterograde labeling in the three subdivisions of the ventral anterior nucleus (pars parvicellularis, VApc; pars densicellularis, VAdc; and pars magnocellularis, VAmc) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VL). NRT fibers had beaded shapes and coursed in a posterior direction giving rise to relatively diffuse terminal plexuses. The average size of the beads (0.7μm2) and their density per 100μm of fiber length (23.7–25.7) were similar between the nuclei studied. At the electron microscopic level, anterogradely labeled boutons displayed positive immunoreactivity for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and formed relatively long (∼0.4μm) symmetric synaptic contacts. Usually, a single terminal formed synapses on more than one postsynaptic structure. Synaptic contacts were on projection and local circuit neurons and targeted mainly their distal dendrites. In the VAmc, synapses on local circuit neurons composed 48% of the total sample, in the VAdc/VApc and in the VL the proportion was higher, 65% and 62%, respectively. The results suggest that the input from the anterior pole of the monkey reticular nucleus to the motor-related thalamic nuclei is organized differently from what is known on the organization of connections of NRT with sensory thalamic nuclei in other species in that the terminal fields of individual fibers are diffuse rather than focal and that at least 50% of synapses are established on GABAergic local circuit neurons.

However, the functional contribution of the rhesus macaque monkey parvocellular nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDpc) in these key higher cognitive processes remains unknown. This study investigated the impact of MDpc damage in cognition. Preoperatively, animals were trained on an object‐in‐place scene discrimination task that assesses rapid learning of novel information within each session. Bilateral neurotoxic (NMDA and ibotenic acid) MDpc lesions did not impair new learning unless the monkey had also sustained damage to the magnocellular division of the MD (MDmc). Contralateral unilateral MDpc and MDmc damage also impaired new learning, while selective unilateral MDmc damage produced new learning deficits that eventually resolved with repeated testing. In contrast, during food reward (satiety) devaluation, monkeys with either bilateral MDpc damage or combined MDpc and MDmc damage showed attenuated food reward preferences compared to unoperated control monkeys; the selective unilateral MDmc damage left performance intact. Our preliminary results demonstrate selective dissociable roles for the two adjacent nuclei of the primate MD, namely, MDpc, as part of a frontal cortical network, and the MDmc, as part of a frontal‐temporal cortical network, in learning, memory and the cognitive control of behavioural choices after changes in reward value. Moreover, the functional cognitive deficits produced after differing MD damage show that the different subdivisions of the MD thalamus support distributed neural networks to rapidly and fluidly incorporate task‐relevant information, in order to optimise the animals’ ability to receive rewards.","episodic memory, frontal‐temporal cortex network, medial prefrontal cortex network",

In five animals, injections of radioactively labeled amino acids were placed in the BF. In four animals, the injections involved different divisions of the NB, HDB, and the most ventral part of the VDB. In those four cases, labeled fibers in the medial forebrain bundle were observed traveling caudally towards the hypothalamus where some turned dorsally to enter the inferior thalamic peduncle. These fibers terminated in the ventral half of the magnocellular part of the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MDmc). In a fifth case, the amino acid injection involved most of the MS and the VDB. Labeled fibers traveled caudally from the injection site and entered the stria medullaris. These fibers then traveled caudally before turning ventrally to terminate in the dorsal half of MDmc. To determine which of the diverse neuronal types in the BF gives rise to these thalamic projections, in two monkeys injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were placed into MDmc. Labeled neurons were observed throughout the full extent of the NB, the VDB, the MS, and part of the VP. In order to determine the extent of the cholinergic input to MDmc from the BF, one of the HRP cases was processed for the simultaneous visualization of HRP, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the hydrolytic enzyme for acetylcholine, and a second case was processed for simultaneous visualization of HRP, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine. We observed that 30–50% of the HRP-labeled neurons were putatively cholinergic. In order to determine if the NB projection to MD is a collateral of the NB projection to orbital frontal cortex, one fluorescent retrograde tracer was injected into the orbital frontal cortex and one into MD. This case showed that approximately 5% of the BF neurons that project to MDmc also project to the orbital frontal cortex. These results confirm a significant subcortical projection by which the cholinergic system of the basal forebrain may influence higher cortical functions through the thalamus.",,

SC projects bilaterally to the inferior pulvinar (PI) while occipital cortex projects to PI and the lateral pulvinar (PL). PI has sustaining, topographical projections to layers IV, III and I of areas 18 and 19 (and VI and I of 17) which agrees with the central representation of the visual hemifield and suggests that there is more than one hemifield representation in prestriate cortex. PL adjacent to PI also projects to the same cortical areas and layers, while the portion of PL extending into the caudal pole of the pulvinar projects to layers IV, III and I of areas 20 and 21. Thus, occipital cortices are associated by cortico-thalamocortical connections and also receive direct leminiscal input via SC-PI and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG), while inferotemporal areas 20 and 21 receive only cortico-thalamocortical connections. It is concluded that Stoffels' principle of lamellation holds and, that one pulvinar subdivision projects to several cortical areas, that adjacent pulvinar subdivisions have overlapping projections to these cortical areas and their layers and that the pulvinar also projects to the same cortical area as DLG but to different layers. These connections are similar to those in lower mammals but not to those in the squirrel monkey and bushbaby.",,

Horseradish peroxidase was injected into medial and midline thalamic sites in six cases, and tritiated amino acids were injected into the hippocampal formation in nine others, five of which had prior transections of the fornix. Only the subicular and entorhinal cortices were found to project to the thalamus. From the subicular cortex, dense bilateral projections were traced through the fornix to the anterior nuclei, while lighter fornical projections terminated in other rostral midline sites, including the nuclei reuniens, centralis latocellularis, and paraventricularis. These projections arose predominantly from the polymorphic cells which are located in the deepest cellular layers of the subiculum and prosubiculum. In addition, the subicular cortex was found to project to the nucleus lateralis dorsalis. The latter projection, which showed evidence of a crude topographic organization, ran either through the fornix or, unlike the other subicular efferents, through the sublenticular limb of the internal capsule to form part of the temporopulvinar bundle of Arnold. The nonfornical projection to the nucleus lateralis dorsalis passed through the medial pulvinar, where there was some additional termination. Few, if any, projections from the entorhinal cortex to the thalamus travelled in the fornix. Rather, the entorhinal efferents were carried in the inferior thalamic peduncle to the magnocellular portion of the nucleus medialis dorsalis, and in the internal capsule and bundle of Arnold to the medial pulvinar and the nucleus lateralis dorsalis.",,

Thalamic sections from 15 macaque monkeys were processed for visualization of calbindin (CB), parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (ir). PV-, CR- and SMI-32ir distributions did not show any clear correlation with known functional subdivisions. In contrast, CBir distribution reliably defined two markedly distinct motor thalamic territories, one characterized by high cell and neuropil CBir (CB-positive territory), the other by very low cell and neuropil CBir (CB-negative territory). These two neurochemically distinct compartments, the CB-negative and the CB-positive territories, appear to correspond to the cerebellar- and basal ganglia-recipient territories, respectively. To verify the possible correspondence of the CB-negative territory with the cerebellar-recipient sector of the motor thalamus, we compared the distribution of cerebello-thalamic projections with the distribution of CBir in two monkeys. The distribution of cerebellar afferent terminals was similar to that reported from previous reports and in line with the notion that in the motor thalamus the cerebellar-recipient territory does not respect cytoarchitectonic boundaries. Comparison with CB immunoarchitecture showed very close correspondence in the motor thalamus between the distribution of the anterograde labeling and the CB-negative territory, suggesting that the CB-negative territory represents the architectonic counterpart of the cerebellar-recipient territory. CB immunostaining may therefore represent a helpful tool for describing the association between thalamocortical projections and the basal ganglia or the cerebellar loops and for establishing possible homologies between the motor thalamus of non-human primates and humans.",,

A template atlas based on coronal, sagittal and horizontal brain sections","A stereotaxic brain atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus of Macaca fascicularis presented here is designed with a surgical perspective. In this regard, all coordinates have been referenced to a line linking the anterior and posterior commissures (ac–pc line) and considering the center of the ac at the midline as the origin of the bicommissural space. The atlas comprises of 43 different plates (19 coronal levels, 10 sagittal levels and 14 horizontal levels). In addition to ‘classical’ cyto- and chemoarchitectural techniques such as the Nissl method and the acetylcholinesterase stain, several immunohistochemical stains have been performed in adjacent sections, including the detection of tyrosine hydroxylase, enkephalin, neurofilaments, parvalbumin and calbindin. In comparison to other existing stereotaxic atlases for M. fasicularis, this atlas has two main advantages: firstly, brain cartography is based on a wide variety of cyto- and chemoarchitectural stains carried out on adjacent sections, therefore enabling accurate segmentation. Secondly and most importantly, sagittal and horizontal planes are included. Sagittal planes are very useful for calculating oblique trajectories, whereas, clinical researchers engaged in neuroimaging studies will be more familiar with horizontal sections, as they use horizontal (also called “axial”) brain images in their daily routine of their clinical practices.","Stereotaxy, Parkinson’s disease, Ventriculography, Cerebral cartography",

In the course of mapping the dorsal thalamus, we also studied neurons in a subset of thalamic nuclei (the caudal part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), the oral part of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPLo), the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)) lateral to the MD and just across the internal medullary lamina. We compared these “paralaminar” neurons to MD neurons by having monkeys perform the same spatial and nonspatial cognitive tasks as those used to investigate the MD; these included two saccadic tasks—one requiring delayed and the other immediate responses—and one picture fixation task. Of the paralaminar thalamic neurons modulated by the saccadic tasks, a majority had saccade-related activity, and this was nearly always spatially tuned. Also, for about half of these neurons, the saccade-related activity occurred exclusively during the delayed-response task. No neurons with event-related activity in the saccadic tasks were preferentially modulated by specific picture stimuli, although other neurons were. All of these results were similar to what we had found for MD neurons. However, in contrast to the high proportion of presaccadic responses observed in the MD, the majority of saccade-related neurons in paralaminar thalamus exhibited mid- or postsaccadic activity, i.e., that started during or after the saccade. Our findings suggest that neurons in the paralaminar thalamus may be possible conduits of oculomotor feedback signals, especially during memory-guided saccades.",,

The aim of the present study is the characterization of thalamic afferents of these two areas. For this purpose, retrograde neuronal tracers were injected, or placed in crystal form, in areas PEc and PE. We found that the two areas show a similar pattern of thalamic inputs, mainly originating from Lateral Posterior (LP), Pulvinar (Pul), Ventral Posterior Lateral (VPL), and Ventral Lateral (VL) nuclei, all structures known to be involved in visual, somatosensory, and/or sensorimotor processing. Minor afferents were observed from the Centromedian/Parafascicular complex (CM/PF), Central Lateral (CL), Ventral Anterior (VA), and Medial Dorsal (MD) nuclei. LP and VL were more strongly connected to PEc than to PE, while the other main thalamic inputs to the two areas showed slight differences in strength. The part of the Pul mostly connected with areas PEc and PE was the Medial Pul. No labeled cells were found in the retinotopically organized Lateral and Inferior Pul. In the somatotopically organized VPL and VL nuclei, labeled neurons were mainly found in regions likely to correspond to the trunk and limb representations (in particular the legs). These findings are in line with the sensory-motor nature of areas PEc and PE, and with their putative functional roles, being them suggested to be involved in the preparation and control of limb interaction with the environment, and in locomotion.",,

The projection patterns in the newborn macaque were compared with those of the mature animal reported by Darian-Smith et al. (J. Comp. Neurol. 1990;298:000–000).

We investigated the distribution of thalamocortical neurons projecting to forelimb representations of the SMA and the MI using a multiple retrograde labeling technique in the monkey. The forelimb area of the SMA, and the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI were identified by electrophysiological techniques of intracortical microstimulation and single neuron recording. Injections were made into these three representations with three different dyes in the same animal (horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin, diamidino yellow, and fast blue), and the thalamic neurons were retrogradely labeled. Injections into the SMA densely labeled thalamic neurons in nuclei ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo), ventralis lateralis pars medialis (VLm) and ventralis lateralis pars caudalis (VLc), but not in nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo). Injections into the MI labeled thalamic neurons primarily in VLo, VLc, and VPLo. We found that the distribution of projection neurons to the three areas was largely separate in the thalamus. However, in the middle part of VLo, and in a limited portion of VLc, thalamic neurons projecting to the SMA partially overlapped with those to the distal forelimb area of the MI. They overlapped little with those to the proximal forelimb area of the MI. We noted no overlap between the distributions of thalamic projection neurons to the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI.

Here, we describe the thalamic projections to two of these areas (V6 and V6A), based on 14 retrograde neuronal tracer injections in 11 hemispheres of 9 Macaca fascicularis. The injections were placed either by direct visualisation or using electrophysiological guidance, and the location of injection sites was determined post mortem based on cyto- and myeloarchitectural criteria. We found that the majority of the thalamic afferents to the visual area V6 originate in subdivisions of the lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei, with weaker inputs originating from the central densocellular, paracentral, lateral posterior, lateral geniculate, ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei. In contrast, injections in both the dorsal and ventral parts of the visuomotor area V6A revealed strong inputs from the lateral posterior and medial pulvinar nuclei, as well as smaller inputs from the ventrolateral complex and from the central densocellular, paracentral, and mediodorsal nuclei. These projection patterns are in line with the functional properties of injected areas: “dorsal stream” extrastriate area V6 receives information from visuotopically organised subdivisions of the thalamus; whereas visuomotor area V6A, which is involved in the sensory guidance of arm movement, receives its primary afferents from thalamic nuclei that provide high-order somatic and visual input.",,

By showing that responses in visual thalamus are modulated by perceptual and cognitive tasks, recent fMRI and physiology studies have helped revise this view. The modulatory input to the visual thalamus derives from functionally distinct cortical and subcortical feedback pathways. These pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements. Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity. These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.",,

To detail these interactions better, the present study used retrograde tracers to reveal the origins of the corticothalamic projections in two closely related monkey species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). The medial dorsal thalamic nucleus received only light cortical inputs, which predominantly arose from area 23. Efferents to the anterior medial thalamic nucleus also arose principally from area 23, but these projections proved more numerous than those to the medial dorsal nucleus and also involved additional inputs from areas 29 and 30. The anterior ventral and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei had similar sources of inputs from the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. For both nuclei, the densest projections arose from areas 29 and 30, with numbers of thalamic inputs often decreasing when going dorsal from area 23a to 23c and to area 31. In all cases, the corticothalamic projections almost always arose from the deepest cortical layer. The different profiles of inputs to the anterior medial and anterior ventral thalamic nuclei reinforce other anatomical and electrophysiological findings suggesting that these adjacent thalamic nuclei serve different, but complementary, functions supporting memory. While the lack of retrosplenial connections singled out the medial dorsal nucleus, the very similar connection patterns shown by the anterior ventral and laterodorsal nuclei point to common roles in cognition.","cingulate cortex, memory, primate, retrosplenial cortex, thalamus",

Despite using different methods and different species, the principal pattern remained the same. For both target areas, the contralateral hippocampal (subiculum) projections arose via efferents in the postcommissural fornix ipsilateral to the tracer injection, which then crossed hemispheres both in or just prior to reaching the target site within the thalamus or hypothalamus. Precommissural fornix fibres could not be followed to the target areas. There was scant evidence that the ventral hippocampal commissure or decussating fornix fibres contribute to these crossed subiculum projections. Meanwhile, a small minority of postsubiculum projections in the mouse were seen to cross in the descending fornix at the level of the caudal septum to join the contralateral postcommissural fornix before reaching the anterior thalamus and lateral mammillary nucleus on that side. Although the rodent anterior thalamic nuclei also receive nonfornical inputs from the subiculum and postsubiculum via the ipsilateral internal capsule, few, if any, of these projections cross the midline. It was also apparent that nuclei within the head direction system (anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, and lateral mammillary nucleus) receive far fewer crossed hippocampal inputs than the other anterior thalamic or mammillary nuclei.

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV, and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits. J. Comp.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we developed and characterized a macaque model of CPSP. The location of the VPL was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation, after which a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Immunohistochemistry revealed that microglial and astrocytic activation in the perilesional areas lasted at least 3 months after injection. The present model reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Further, the long-lasting glial activation revealed here may be characteristic of primate brains following injury. The present model will be useful not only for examining the neurological changes underlying CPSP, but also for testing therapeutic interventions for CPSP.",,

Human transcripts were used for the synthesis of α2, α4, β2, β3, γ1 and δ subunit messenger RNA probes. Rat complementary DNAs were used for generating α1, α3, β1 and γ2 subunit messenger RNA probes. Nigral, pallidal and cerebellar afferent territories in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei all expressed α1, α2, α3, α4, β1, β2, β3, δ and γ2 subunit messenger RNAs but at different levels. Each intralaminar nucleus displayed its own unique expression pattern. In the thalamus, γ1 subunit messenger RNA was detected only in the parafascicular nucleus. Comparison of the expression patterns with the known organization of GABAA connections in thalamic nuclei suggests that (i) the composition of the receptor associated with reticulothalamic synapses, except for those in the intralaminar nuclei, may be α1α4β2δ, (ii) receptors of various other subunit compositions may operate in the local GABAergic circuits, and (iii) the composition of receptors at nigro- and pallidothalamic synapses may differ, with those at nigrothalamic probably containing β1 and γ2 subunits. In the medial and lateral parts of the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticularis, the α1, β2 and γ2 messenger RNAs were co-expressed at a high level suggesting that this subunit composition was associated with all GABAergic synapses in the direct and indirect striatal output pathways. Various other subunit messenger RNAs were also expressed but at a lower level. In the substantia nigra pars compacta the most highly expressed messenger RNAs were α3, α4 and β3; all other subunit messenger RNAs studied, except for γ1, α1 and α2, were expressed at a moderate to high level. In the striatum, the following subunit messenger RNAs were expressed (listed in order of decreasing signal intensity): α4, β3, α2, α3, β2, δ, γ2, α1. The expression patterns found in the monkey were similar to those described in comparable nuclei in the rat by Wisden et al. [J. Neurosci. (1992) 12, p. 1040]; however, the monkey nuclei displayed a much greater variety of GABAA receptor subunit messenger RNAs.","motor pathways; local circuits; primate; GABAA receptor subtypes; thalamus; CL, centrolateral nucleus; CM, centromedian nucleus; DTT, dithiothreitol; GPl, lateral globus pallidus; GPm, medial globus pallidus; LCN, local circuit neurons; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; MG, medial geniculate nucleus; NRT, nucleus reticularis thalami; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr, substantia nigra pars reticularis; SSC, sodium chloride/sodium citrate; STN, subthalamic nucleus; VAdc, ventral anterior nucleus pars densicellularis; VAmc, ventral anterior nucleus pars magnocellularis; VL, ventrolateral nucleus; VPm, ventroposterior medial nucleus;",

Injections that filled all of VLpv labeled abundant neurons that were inhomogeneously distributed among many unlabeled cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN). Single large pressure injections made in face-, forelimb-, or hindlimb-related portions of VLpv using physiological guidance labeled numerous neurons that were broadly dispersed within a coarse somatotopographic anteroposterior (foot to face) gradient in the dentate and interposed nuclei. Small iontophoretic injections labeled fewer neurons with the same somatotopographic gradient, but strikingly, the labeled neurons in these cases were as broadly dispersed as in cases with large injections. Simultaneous injections of multiple tracers in VLpv (one tracer per somatic region with no overlap between injections) confirmed the general somatotopography but also demonstrated clearly the overlapping distributions and the close intermingling of neurons labeled with different tracers. Significantly, very few neurons (<2%) were double-labeled. This organizational pattern contrasts with the concept of a segregated “point-to-point” somatotopy and instead resembles the complex patterns that have been observed throughout the motor pathway. These data support the idea that muscle synergies are represented anatomically in the DCbN by a general somatotopography in which intermingled neurons and dispersed but selective connections provide the basis for plastic, adaptable movement coordination of different parts of the body.

Whilst binding sites were evident throughout the thalamus, the internuclear differences in the Bmax were up to 10-fold. In the basal ganglia the binding density was on average lower than in the thalamus. The highest number of binding sites was in striatum followed closely by substantia nigra. In both the thalamus and basal ganglia, the binding density was higher than previously described in the rat. Although our results do not allow us to differentiate between presynaptic and postsynaptic locations of GABAB sites we conclude that with a few exceptions the distribution pattern of GABAB binding sites in the monkey thalamus appears to correlate with the known innervation from the NRT.",GABAB receptors; Primate; Reticular thalamic nucleus;,

Comp. Neurol. 262:331–364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 μm2) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 μm2), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 μm2) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 μm2 and 1.6 μm2, respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 μm of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest. J.

Cell types and synaptology,"The nucleus ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis (V Amc) is recognized only in primates and is the major recipient of the nigrothalamic projections. The neuronal and synaptic composition of this nucleus in the rhesus monkey was studied with the use of a variety of neuroanatomical techniques that included quantitative morphometry, anterograde and retrograde labeling with WGA-HRP from the prefrontal cortex, and immunocytochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Two major cell types were identified in the nucleus: thalamocortical projection neurons (PN) that were multipolar cells of various sizes, and small GAD-immunoreactive cells, apparently local circuit neurons (LCN). The approximate ratio of the two types of cells was 10:1. The major type of bouton encountered in the neuropil was of medium to large-sized (areas from 1.5 to 12 μ2) and mostly of en passant type. These terminals formed symmetric contacts, contained moderate amounts of pleomorphic or mostly flat synaptic vesicles and large numbers of mitochondria, and displayed numerous puncta adhaerentia. All of these boutons exhibited positive GAD immunoreactivity. These boutons constituted the only synaptic population on somata and primary dendrites of PN and formed an overwhelming majority on the secondary PN dendrites. There were fewer of these axon terminals on tertiary PN and LCN dendrites. Additionally, boutons with similar features formed synapses on axon hillocks or initial axonal segments of PN, and somata or very proximal parts of primary dendrites of LCN. With the exception of the boutons in the last two locations, all of the other boutons in this group were shown to be terminals of the nigrothalamic afferents in the parallel EM autoradiographic study (Kultas-Ilinsky and Ilinsky: J. Comp Neurol. 294:479-489,'90). The second major bouton population in the VAmc was represented by small to mediumsized terminals (areas range from 0.2 to 2.0 μ2) that formed distinct asymmetric contacts and contained large numbers of round vesicles and few or no mitochondria. These boutons were labeled anterogradely from the cortex and dominated on distal PN and LCN dendrites. Some of them were found on secondary PN dendrites where they formed synapses either directly or indirectly via LCN dendrites and dendro-dendritic contacts. The latter arrangements, i. e., serial synapses, were also formed between the cortical boutons and PN somata or tertiary dendrites. The third population of axon terminals encountered in the V Amc was represented by medium to large-sized boutons (areas from 2.0 to 3.5 μ2) with round vesicles and asymmetric contacts, i. e., all features of these boutons except the size were similar to those of cortical afferents. However, they were not labeled after cortical injections and were presumed to be terminals of superior colliculus afferents to the thalamus. These boutons formed synapses on secondary and tertiary PN dendrites and distal LCN dendrites, but were encountered infrequently. No complex synaptic arrangements such as glomeruli or reciprocal synapses were found in the V Amc neuropil; triad relationships were also practically absent. The results demonstrate that the ultrastructural organization of the V Amc is quite different from that of many specific thalamic nuclei processing sensory modalities. The findings pose interesting questions with respect to the mechanism of functioning of V Amc projection neurons and the overall significance of the ascending basal ganglia output via the nigrothalamic pathway.",,

In order to further test these differences, we used electrical stimulation to map the ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei of the thalamus in three ketamine anaesthetised monkeys. Movements were readily evoked from VL at currents of down to 10 μA. The movements were typically multi-joint, and stimulation could evoke arm and trunk or arm and facial movement at the same current threshold. Evoked arm movements often involved multiple joints, with or without finger movements. Facial movements included the lips, tongue, jaw, eyebrows and, occasionally, the eyes. The thalamic map was topographic, but complex with at least two separate regions related to arm movement. Very few sites within the VA could stimulate movement, even at high currents. We therefore suggest that the cerebellar projections to motor regions of the cortex, which pass through the VL thalamic nuclei, have a different relationship and are closer to movement execution than the projections from basal ganglia via the ventro-anterior nucleus.",,

In each monkey, Fast Blue (FB) was injected into the handarm area of the SMA after mapping the somatotopy using intracortical microstimulation, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) was injected into the ipsilateral internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). As a result, numerous projection neurons labeled with FB were distributed in pallidal terminal areas labeled with WGA-HRP in the ventral nuclear group of the thalamus.

Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the ventral parts of dentate nuclei. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the VL were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the thalamus. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the VL either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different VL locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the thalamus. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the VL that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus. J. Comp.

Gerbella et al. (2010) Cereb. Cortex, 20, 141–168], and compared them with those to area 8/FEF (frontal eye field). Both areas 45A and 45B were the targets of highly predominant projections from the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and of additional projections, mostly from the magnocellular ventral anterior and the medial pulvinar nucleus. The projection profiles from different MD subdivisions clearly distinguished these two areas from one another and from area 8/FEF. Area 45A was the target of predominant projections from parvicellular MD and of minor, albeit robust, projections from magnocellular MD. The opposite was true for area 45B: magnocellular MD was the major source of projections and parvicellular MD contributed minor, albeit robust, projections. Furthermore, area 45B, but not area 45A, was targeted by robust projections from multiform MD, the principal thalamic nucleus for area 8/FEF. These results provide further evidence for the distinctiveness of areas 45A and 45B, and support the idea that area 45B is affiliated with the frontal oculomotor system, challenging the proposed homology of this area with part of the human language-related area 45 (rostral part of Broca’s region). Furthermore, the present data provide evidence for potentially robust trans-thalamic (via magnocellular MD) afferent, as well as direct and reciprocal, amygdaloid connections of areas 45A and 45B, suggesting the contribution of emotional information to the differential role of these two areas in non-spatial information processing.",,

For light microscopic analysis small biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or biocytin injections were placed in midrostral and dorsal portions of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), respectively. The distribution of anterograde and retrograde labeling was charted, and representative axons and terminal fields were reconstructed in the sagittal plane to examine their features. Two types of fibers were identified—those of thin diameter forming diffuse terminal fields with small boutons, and thick fibers forming focal terminal fields with large boutons. Area PFG injection of BDA resulted in labeling of both types of fibers in LP, MD, and pulvinar, whereas only fibers of the first type were found in VL. Biocytin injection in area Opt resulted in preferential labeling of large fibers terminating in LP and pulvinar. Further electron microscopic analysis of labeled boutons in VL and LP, following a large wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase injection in the middle of IPL, confirmed the existence of small and large corticothalamic boutons and their different termination sites: the small boutons formed synapses on distal dendrites while the large boutons were found close to somata of thalamocortical projection neurons, on the dendrites of local circuit neurons and in complex synaptic arrangements, such as glomeruli.

The potential advantages of this technique are discussed compared with those previously used to determine amygdaloid afferents. The findings indicate that certain agranular or dysgranular cortical regions may project directly to the amygdala: in particular, the orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, subcallosal gyrus, temporal pole and anterior insula. These projections probably terminate predominantly in either the lateral or accessory basal nuclei. Other cortical projections from the inferotemporal and superior temporal gyri are described. Evidence was found for a heavy projection from the superior temporal sulcus to the lateral nucleus. Subcortical afferents were found from the hypothalamus, substantia innominata, diagonal band, thalamus, periaqueductal central gray, peripeduncular nucleus and from a band of cells extending medially from the peripeduncular nucleus to the midline, just ventral to the thalamus.

Projections from the dopamine-containing cells of the ventral mesencephalon to the prefrontal cortex are also critical for these cognitive abilities. It is unclear, however, whether dopamine axons innervate the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in primates. In order to address this question, we examined the distribution of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus of macaque monkeys. Labeled axons were distributed quite heterogeneously in this nucleus, and did not strictly follow cytoarchitectonic subdivision boundaries. The ventral and lateral portions of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, which include parts of the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions, had the highest density of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons. In contrast, the dorsomedial portion, which included primarily the magnocellular subdivision, had the lowest density of labeled axons. In both lightly and densely innervated portions of the nucleus, small, dense clusters of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons were present. Axons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase were distributed in a pattern very similar to that of dopamine transporter-labeled axons. In contrast, noradrenergic axons, as revealed by dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity, were present in higher density and were more evenly distributed throughout the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. This dopamine innervation of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus reveals another possible anatomical substrate through which dopamine may influence the cognitive functions mediated by thalamo-prefrontal circuitry.","dopamine beta-hydroxylase; prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia; tyrosine hydroxylase; DA, dopamine; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; DAT, dopamine membrane transporter; DBH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase; IR, immunoreactive; MD, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; NDS, normal donkey serum; NE, norepinephrine; NGS, normal goat serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFC, prefrontal cortex; SN, substantia nigra; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase;",

The main forebrain target of Pf is the striatum, but the specific striatal regions receiving visceral input via this pathway are unknown. We examined the projections of this region by injecting anterograde tracers into the vagus evoked potential (VEP) focus in Pf of macaque monkeys. The VEP was strongest lateral and anterior to the habenulointerpeduncular tract, but it was distributed across the entire horizontal extent of the ventral half of Pf. All injections produced labeled terminals in the caudate (Cd), especially the Cd tail and the adjacent ventral posterior Pu. Terminations occurred throughout the Cd head and body but spared the most anterior and dorsolateral parts. Injections in more anterior and lateral portions of Pf produced progressively more terminations in Pu, mainly in the precommissural region and the medial aspect of posterior Pu. Dual injections of different tracers revealed overlapping projections with interdigitated strands of striatal terminations from separate regions of Pf as well as the posteromedial to anterolateral topographic gradient of increasing Pf projections to Pu. An injection in the most anteromedial portion of Pf produced strong labeling in the ventral striatum. Thus, Pf transmits viscerosensory information to the “associative” and “limbic” territories of the striatum. These findings suggest the broad involvement of homeostatic afferent activity in striatal function and perhaps a role for the striatum in autonomic function. J. Comp.

Because the TRN receives bottom-up sensory input and top-down cortical input, it could serve as an integration hub for sensory and cognitive signals. Functional evidence supports broad roles for the TRN in arousal, attention, and sensory selection. How specific circuits connecting the TRN with sensory thalamic structures implement these functions is not known. The structural organization and function of the TRN is particularly interesting in the context of highly organized sensory systems, such as the primate visual system, where neurons in the retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN) are morphologically and physiologically distinct and also specialized for processing particular features of the visual environment. To gain insight into the functional relationship between the visual sector of the TRN and the dLGN, we reconstructed a large number of TRN neurons that were retrogradely labeled following injections of rabies virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the dLGN. An independent cluster analysis, based on 10 morphological metrics measured for each reconstructed neuron, revealed three clusters of TRN neurons that differed in cell body shape and size, dendritic arborization patterns, and medial-lateral position within the TRN. TRN dendritic and axonal morphologies are inconsistent with visual stream-specific projections to the dLGN. Instead, TRN neuronal organization could facilitate transmission of global arousal and/or cognitive signals to the dLGN with retinotopic precision that preserves specialized processing of foveal versus peripheral visual information.",,

One of the questions raised by the concept of parallelism is whether and how the different circuits interact. The present Commentary proposes that interaction is inherent in the neural architecture of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. This proposal is based on the re-examination of the data on the topographical organization of the frontocortical-basal ganglia connections which indicates that each circuit-engaged striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of both substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (each ventral striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus), and this segregation is maintained at subsequent thalamic and frontocortical levels. This results in an asymmetry in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia relationships, so that while each frontocortical subfield innervates one striatal region, each striatal region influences the basal ganglia output to two frontocortical subfields. Because of this asymmetry, at least one of the frontocortical targets of a given circuit-engaged striatal region is not the source of its frontocortical input. Since this organization is inconsistent with an arrangement in closed segregated circuits we introduce the concept of a “split circuit”. A split circuit emanates from one frontocortical area, but terminates in two frontocortical areas. Thus, a split circuit contains at least one “open” striato-fronto-cortical pathway, that leads from a circuit-engaged striatal region to a frontocortical area which is a source of a different circuit. In this manner split circuits are interconnected via their open pathways. The second striato-fronto-cortical pathway of a split circuit can be another open pathway, or it can re-enter the frontocortical area of origin, forming a closed circuit. On the basis of the available anatomical data we tentatively identified a motor, an associative, and a limbic split circuit, each containing a closed circuit and an open pathway. The motor split circuit contains a closed motor circuit that re-enters the motor and premotor cortical areas and an open motor pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex. The associative split circuit contains a closed associative circuit that re-enters the associative prefrontal cortex and an open associative pathway that terminates in the premotor cortex. The limbic split circuit contains a closed limbic circuit that re-enters the limbic prefrontal cortex, an open limbic pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex, and possibly an additional open limbic pathway terminating in the motor/premotor cortices. Possible functional implications of this open interconnected organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are discussed.","AGI; lateral agranular cortex; AGm; medial agranular cortex; ACA; anterior cingulate area; AIA; agranular insular area; C-P; caudate-putamen; DA; dopamine; ENK; enkephalin; FEF; frontal eye field; GP; globus pallidus; GPe; globus pallidus, external segment; GPi; globus pallidus, internal segment; IC-P; lateral part of the caudate-putamen; IVM; lateral part of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus; M1; primary motor cortex; MD; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; MDmc; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, magnocellular subdivision, MDm, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, medial segment; MD1; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, lateral segment; MDce; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, central segment; NAcc; nucleus accumbens; PFC; prefrontal cortex; PL; prelimbic cortex; PMC; premotor cortex; rmGPi; rostromedial globus pallidus, internal segment; SMA; supplementary motor area; SNC; substantia nigra pars compacta; SNR; substantia nigra pars reticulata; SP; substance P; VA; ventroanterior thalamic nucleus; VAdc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, dencicellular subdivision; VAmc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, magnocellular subdivision; VApc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, parvicellular subdivision; VM; ventromedial thalamic nucleus; VL; ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; VA/VL; ventroanterior-ventrolateral thalamic complex; VP; ventral pallidum;",

Our observations indicate that the rostral superior parietal lobule (SPL) is connected with the ventroposterolateral (VPL) thalamic nucleus. In addition, whereas the rostral SPL is connected with the ventrolateral (VL) and lateral posterior (LP) thalamic nuclei, the rostral IPL has connections with the ventroposteroinferior (VPI), ventroposteromedial parvicellular (VPMpc), and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei as well as the VL nucleus. The caudal SPL and the midportion of IPL show projections mainly to the lateral posterior (LP) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei, respectively. These areas also have minor projections to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Finally, the medial SPL and the caudal IPL project heavily to the PM nucleus, dorsally and ventrally, respectively. In addition, the medial SPL has some connections with the LP nucleus, whereas the caudal IPL has projections to the lateral dorsal (LD) nucleus. Furthermore, the caudal and medial SPL and the caudal IPL regions have additional projections to the reticular and intralaminar nuclei–the caudal SPL predominantly to the reticular, and the caudal IPL mainly to the intralaminar nuclei. These results indicate that the rostral-to-caudal flow of cortical connectivity within the superior and inferior parietal lobules is paralleled by a rostral-to-caudal progression of thalamic connectivity. That is, rostral parietal association cortices project primarily to modality-specific thalamic nuclei, whereas more caudal regions project most strongly to associative thalamic nuclei.",,

To characterize the pathways and types of signals supplied to cortex, we recorded responses to rotational and/or translational stimuli in the macaque thalamus. Few cells responded to rotation alone, with most showing convergence between semicircular canal and otolith signals. During sinusoidal rotation, thalamic responses lead head velocity by ∼30° on average at frequencies between 0.01–4 Hz. During translation, neurons encoded combinations of linear acceleration and velocity. In general, thalamic responses were similar to those recorded in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei using identical testing paradigms, but differed from those of vestibular afferents. Thalamic responses represented a biased continuum: most cells more strongly encoded translation and fewer cells modulated primarily in response to net gravitoinertial acceleration. Responsive neurons were scattered within a large area that included regions of the ventral posterior and ventral lateral nuclei, and so were not restricted to the known vestibular nuclei projection zones. To determine the origins of these responses, a retrograde tracer was injected into a dorsolateral thalamic site where rotation/translation-sensitive cells were encountered. This injection labeled neurons in the rostral contralateral anterior interposed and fastigial nuclei, but did not label cells within the vestibular nuclei. Examination of thalamic terminations after tracer injections into the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei indicated that most vestibular responsive units fall within the thalamic terminal zones of these nuclei. Thus, vestibular signals, which are supplied to the thalamus from both vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, are positioned for distribution to widespread cortical areas.","sensorimotor, thalamocortical, cerebellar nuclei, vestibular nuclei, translation, semicircular canals, motion, otolith organs",

The aim of this study was to establish whether information about force, velocity or duration of movement is encoded in cerebellar thalamic discharge and could therefore be involved in the modulation of motor cortical activity. Extracellular single cell recordings were made from the cerebellar thalamus (66 neurones) and VPLc (49 neurones) of four conscious macaques performing simple wrist movements with various load and gain conditions imposed. A significant correlation (Spearman's; P < 0.05) was found between movement duration and the duration of neuronal discharge of most cerebellar thalamic neurones (65%), the velocity of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of some cerebellar thalamic neurones (23%), but not between force of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of any cerebellar thalamic neurones. Similar relationships were found between the activity of VPLc neurones and these movement parameters. The strength of the correlations increased when many cells were grouped and analysed as an ensemble, suggesting that populations of cerebellar thalamic (and VPLc) neurones can encode a signal with higher fidelity than single neurones alone. The ensemble data confirmed that the most robust association was between the duration of neuronal discharge and movement duration. We propose that the cerebellum does not provide the motor cortex with specific information about movement force or velocity, but rather that its major role is in activating many motor cortical regions for a specific duration, thus influencing the timing of complex movements involving many muscles and joints.",,

Past theories have relied on the intralaminar nuclei as the sources of diffuse thalamocortical projections that could facilitate spread of activity across the cortex. A case is made for the presence of a matrix of superficially-projecting cells, not confined to the intralaminar nuclei but extending throughout the whole thalamus. These cells are distinguished by immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein, D28K calbindin, are found in all thalamic nuclei of primates and have increased numbers in some nuclei. They project to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex over relatively wide areas, unconstrained by architectonic boundaries. They generally receive subcortical inputs that lack the topographic order and physiological precision of the principal sensory pathways. Superimposed upon the matrix in certain nuclei only, is a core of cells distinguished by immunoreactivity for another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, These project in highly ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that are topographically precise and have readily identifiable physiological properties. The parvalbumin cells form the basis for sensory and other inputs that are to be used as a basis for perception. The calbindin cells, especially when recruited by corticothalamic connections, can form a basis for the engagement of multiple cortical areas and thalamic nuclei that is essential for the binding of multiple aspects of sensory experience into a single framework of consciousness.","thalamus; primates; cell-specific cortical projections; arousal; consciousness; CAMKII-α, alpha-type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; CL, central lateral nucleus; CO, cytochrome oxidase; LGd, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; Li-SG, limitans-suprageniculate nucleus; MGad, anterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus; MGmc, magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus; MGpd, posterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus; MGv, ventral medial geniculate nucleus; Pla, anterior pulvinar nucleus; Po, posterior nucleus; VLa, anterior ventral lateral nucleus; VLp, ventral lateral posterior nucleus; VMb, basal ventral medial nucleus; VPI, ventral posterior inferior nucleus; VPL, ventral posterior lateral nucleus; VPM, ventral posterior medial nucleus;",

Some observations regarding the cytoarchitecture of the dorsal column nuclei are reported; the gracile nucleus differs cytoarchitectonically over the rostrocaudal dimension in a way similar to the feline nucleus; the cuneate nucleus has a distinct pars rotunda (Ferraro and Barrera, '35) which might be analogous to a similar structure in the raccoon shown to be activated by afferents from the volar side of the hand and digits (Johnson et al., '68). Cytoarchitectonic observations and other arguments suggesting the presence of the nucleus Z in the monkey are presented. In Nissl stained frontal sections, cut in the stereotaxic frontal plane as well as in sections cut perpendicular to the long axis of the brain stem the cytoarchitecture and topography of the posteromedial, ventroposterior and centrolateral thalamic nuclei of the macaque were analysed. The posteromedial nucleus (POm) has been found to include portions of Olszewski's ('52) magnocellular medial geniculate, suprageniculate and pulvinar nuclei. The nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL) corresponds to the main portion of Olszewski's VPLc, whereas most of his VPLo corresponds to the nucleus ventralis intermedius of Hassler ('59) and Mehler ('71). Electrolytic lesions were used to study the projection from the gracile and cuneate nuclei to the thalamus. With postoperative survival periods of 6 to 14 days the resulting degeneration was studied in frontal sections stained according to the Wiitanen modification of the Fink-Heimer method. Both the gracile and cuneate nuclei project profusely to the contralateral nucleus ventralis posterolateralis and more sparsely to the contralateral posteromedial nucleus and the zona incerta. A distinct somatotopic organization exists in the projection to the ventroposterior nucleus, but not in that to the other target areas. The projection to the ventroposterior nucleus is very dense and evenly distributed except rostrally and dorsally, where it is more scattered. It is concluded that the posteromedial and the ventroposterior thalamic nuclei are very similar in monkeys and cats regarding cytoarchitecture, topography and afferent projections from the dorsal column nuclei.",,

The central theme of the segregated circuits hypothesis is that structural convergence and functional integration occurs within each of the identified circuits. In primates, the basal ganglia motor pathways are focused principally on the putamen and its connections. This part of the neostriatum receives topographic projections from primary motor cortex (MC). The focus of the terminals originating in the putamen appears to lie somewhat dorsal to that of the terminals arising from the body of the caudate.

Moderately to weakly projected areas were the intermediate and lateral parts of the agranular insular cortex, orbital part of area 12, agranular and dysgranular part of the temporal pole cortex (TPa-g), auditory temporal cortex, lateral and medial (MS) septal nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and medial preoptic area, dorsomedial, lateral, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, magnocellular lateral basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, paratenial, paraventricular (PV), inter-antero-medial (IAM), reticular, central medial (CeM), parafascicular (PF) and limitans nuclei of the thalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, pedunculo-pontine nucleus, dorsal part of the lateral lemniscal nucleus, ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal raphe, superior central nucleus, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei (PBl) and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC). A few scattered terminals were observed in the perifornical nucleus of the hypothalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta. PL and area 24 were characterized by projections to the entorhinal (Ent) and piriform (Pir) cortex as well as to the magnocellular part of the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus (VAmc). The morphology of the terminal arborization in each nuclei was different in appearance, perhaps reflecting the synaptic interaction between the nerve terminals and postsynaptic dendrites. PL projected uniquely to Ent, Pir and VAmc and IL projected uniquely to TPa-g, MS, IAM, CeM, MDpc, PF, PBl and LC. IL projected more strongly than PL to the shell of Acb, amygdaloid nuclei, PV, TM, VTA and PAGdl. The present results support the hypothesis that IL is a major cortical autonomic motor area and PL integrates limbic and autonomic inputs in the primate.","Other systems of the CNS; Limbic system and hypothalamus; Infralimbic area; Prelimbic area; Medial prefrontal cortex; Monkey; Biotinylated dextran amine; Efferent connection; ABmc, accessory basal amygdaloid nucleus, magnocellular part; Acb, accumbens nucleus; BLmc, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, magnocellular part; BLpc, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, parvicellular part; BST, bed nucleus of stria terminalis; CeM, central medial thalamic nucleus; CDvm, caudate nucleus, ventromedial part; DB, nucleus of diagonal band; DMH, dorsomedial nucleus of hypothalamus; DR, dorsal raphe nucleus; Ent, entorhinal cortex; Hbl, lateral habenular nucleus; Iai, agranular insular cortex, intermediate part; Ial, agranular insular cortex, lateral part; Iam, agranular insular cortex, medial part; IAM, interanteromedial nucleus of thalamus; Iapm, agranular insular cortex, posteromedial part; L, lateral amygdaloid nucleus; LC, nucleus of locus coeruleus; LH, lateral hypothalamic nucleus; Lim, limitans nucleus of thalamus; LLd, dorsal nucleus of lateral lemniscus; LS, lateral septal nucleus; MDmc, dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, magnocellular part; MDpc, dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, parvicellular part; MS, medial septal nucleus; NCS, superior central nucleus; NTS, nucleu of tractus solitarius; PAG, periaqueductal gray; PAGdl, periaqueductal gray, dorso-lateral part; PBl, lateral parabrachial nucleus; PBm, medial parabrachial nucleus; PF, parafascicular nucleus of thalamus; PFC, prefrontal cortex; PfH, perifornical nucleus of hypothalamus; PH, posterior hypothalamic nucleus; Pir, piriform cortex; PM, medial pulvinar nucleus; POL, lateral preoptic nucleus; POM, medial preoptic nucleus; PPN, pdunculo-pontine nucleus; PT: pretenial nucleus of thalamus; PV, paraventricular nucleus of thalamus; PVH, paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus; R, reticular nucleus of thalamus; Re, reuniens nucleus of thalamus; RPC, reticular parvicellular nucleus; SI, substantia innominata; SNc, substantia nigra, pars compacta; TA, temporal auditory cortical area; TM, tubero-mammillary nucleus of hypothalamus; TP, temporopolar cortex; TPa-g, temporopolar cortex, agranular area; TPdg, temporopolar cortex, dysgranular area; VAmc, ventral anterior nucleus of thalamus, magnocellular part; VMH, ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus; VTA, ventral tegmental area; ZI, zona incerta; 12o, area 12o of prefrontal cortex; 12l, area 12l of prefrontal cortex;",

In the present experiments both intracellular and extracellular recordings were made in these cortical regions to determine if the individual cells receive polysensory information and if interactions between different medalities are a result of local convergence at the cortical cell. The results show that many neurons have visual receptive fields which are bilateral, include the fovea, and are sensitive to moving stimuli. Many of these neurons are also excited or inhibited by auditory stimuli. For both modalities a variety of ON or OFF excitatory and inhibitory effects was seen. The results further indicate that neurons in both regions show auditory-visual interactions and that at least some of these interactions are due to convergence at the cortical cell. For example, we found that auditory stimuli of a specific frequency had a powerful inhibitory effect on many of the neurons and that this inhibitory effect could negate the excitation caused by a visual stimulus. These types of interactions are related to the anatomical inputs and may be possible mechanism implicating each of these regions in attention and discrimination.",,

The previously identified projection of the internal pallidal segment (GPi) to ventral thalamic nuclei showed a topographic organization, with the predominant projection from ventral GPi being to medial and caudal ventralis anterior (VA) and lateralis (VL) and from dorsal GPi to lateral and rostral VA and VL. Pallidal efferent fibers also extended caudally and dorsally into pars caudalis of VL, but they spared the portion of pars oralis of VL shown by others to receive input from the cerebellum. In addition to centromedian labeling in all animals, the parafascicular nucleus was also labeled when isotope was injected into dorsal GPi. The medial route from GPi to the midbrain tegmentum was more substantial than has been shown before, and along this route there was an indication that some fibers terminated in the prerubral region. The projection to the pedunculopontine nucleus was extensive, and fibers continued caudally into the parabrachial nuclei. Pallidal projections to the thalamus seem to be topographically organized but spare thalamic regions that interact with area 4. Caudally directed efferent fibers follow multiple routes and extend more caudally than to the pedunculopontine nuclei.",,

The corticothalamic connections of the paralimbic regions of the orbital frontal, medial prefrontal, cingulate, parahippocampal, and temporal polar cortices were studied with the autoradiographic method in the rhesus monkey. The results revealed that the orbital frontal, medial prefrontal, and temporal polar proisocortices have substantial projections to both the dorsomedial and medial pulvinar nuclei, whereas the anterior cingulate proisocortex (area 24) projects exclusively to the dorsomedial nucleus. These proisocortical areas also have thalamic connections with the intralaminar and midline nuclei. The cortical areas between the proisocortical regions on the one hand and the isocortical areas on the other, that is, the posterior cingulate region (area 23) and the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (areas TF and TH), project predominantly to the dorsal portion of the medial pulvinar nucleus, the anterior nuclear group (AV, AM), and the lateral dorsal (LD) nucleus. Additionally, the posterior cingulate and medial parahippocampal gyri (area TH) have projections to the lateral posterior (LP) nucleus. Thus, it appears that the proisocortical areas, which are characterized by a predominance of infragranular layers and an absence of layer IV, have common thalamic relationships. Likewise, the intermediate paralimbic areas between the proisocortex and isocortical regions, which also have a predominance of infragranular layers but in addition have evidence of a fourth layer, project to the medial pulvinar and to the so-called limbic nuclei, AV, AM, LD, as well as a modality-specific nucleus, LP.",,

The cingulum bundle is observed to consist of three major fiber components originating from thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and cortical association areas. Following isotope injections in the anterior and lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, labelled fibers form an arch in the white matter behind the cingulate sulcus and occupy the ventral sector of the cingulum bundle. The fibers from the anterior thalamic nucleus coursing in the cingulum bundle extended rostrally to the frontal cortex and caudally to area 23 and the retrosplenial cortex. In contrast, the fibers from lateral dorsal nucleus reached the retrosplenial cortex as well as the parahippocampal gyrus and presubiculum. Efferent fibers from the cingulate gyrus occupy a dorsolateral sector of the cingulum bundle. Those fibers from area 24 of the cingulate gyrus are directed to the premotor and prefrontal regions as well as area 23 and retrosplenial cortex. The fibers from area 23 extend rostrally to the prefrontal cortex and caudoventrally to the presubiculum and parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, an association component originates mainly from prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal region. These fibers occupy a more dorsal and lateral periphery in the cingulate white matter.

Counts were made in 10-μm-thick frozen sections and in 1-μm-thick plastic sections and stereological formulae applied to obtain an accurate assessment of the volumetric density of GABA cells in the nuclei. It was found that GABA-immunoreactive cells account for at least 27% of the cells per unit area of all the thalamic nuclei investigated and up to as much as 50% by unit volume. The intralaminar nuclei show only slightly fewer GABA cells than the principal relay nuclei. Previous reports of their absence or relatively low numbers in the intralaminar nuclei probably stem from their smaller size, relatively weaker immunoreactive staining and from failure to apply stereometric formulae that reveal the density of neurons per volume of tissue. These results suggest that the cellular elements of the intralaminar nuclei are not fundamentally different from those of the principal relay nuclei of the thalamus.","AChE; acetylcholinesterase; GAD; glutamate decar☐ylase; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; iso-OMPA; N,N′-bis(1-methylethyl)pyrophosphoroiodiamidic anhydride;",

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The MPS was divided into rostral and caudal (by a plane through the LF), dorsal and ventral (by an appropriate plane), and medial and lateral (by the accessory medullary lamina) parts. Attempts were made to categorize various lesions of the MPS and degeneration was studied in transverse, sagittal and horizontal sections stained by the Nauta and Wiitanen technics. Corresponding Nissl-stained sections were used to delineate thalamic nuclei. Localized lesions in portions of the MPS (11 rostral and 10 caudal) were worthy of anatomical analysis in 21 monkeys. Data support the thesis that fibers of the AL arise predominantly from the outer part of the MPS and pass ventrally and medially through portions of the inner part of the MPS to their site of emergence. Fibers of the LF appear to arise from the inner part of the MPS and project dorsomedially through the internal capsule. Pallidothalamic projections to the rostral ventral tier thalamic nuclei [the ventral anterior (VApc) and the ventral lateral (VLo)] appear topographically organized in three cardinal dimensions. Rostral parts of the MPS project pre-dominantly to parts of VApc, while caudal parts of the MPS project primarily to parts of VLo. There also is a dorsoventral and mediolateral correspondence in the pallidal projection to VApc and VLo which exhibits overlap. Pallidothalamic projections to the contromedian nucleus (CM) terminate preponderantly in rostral and medial regions of the nucleus, and there appears to be a definite correspondence between parts of the MPS and parts of CM, only in the dorsoventral dimension.",,

Most investigators have concluded that the thalamic terminus of these pathways include several nuclei of the somatosensory and intralaminar thalamus. Non-noxious stimuli are carried by the dorsal column/medial lemniscal or the trigeminothalamic pathways which terminate in much more restricted regions of the thalamus than do the STT and vSTT systems. Lesions of components of the somatosensory pathways result in profound changes in the circuitry of the recipient thalamic nuclei. Not only are there the expected losses of the injured axons and their synaptic terminations, but there is also a marked reduction of the intrinsic GABAergic circuitry, even though the GABAergic neurons contributing to the circuitry have not been injured directly by lesions of the afferent pathways. Such changes in the inhibitory circuitry observed in experimental animals may explain the abnormal bursting behavior of thalamic neurons found in patients with central deafferentation pain syndromes. One potential approach to treating chronic pain would be to selectively remove the neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (lamina I) that specifically respond to noxious stimuli (NS neurons). A toxin has been developed (SSP saporin) that binds to the substance P receptor of NS neurons, is internalized by the neuron and kills the cell. SSP saporin has been shown to be effective in rats, and we have recently demonstrated that it effectively causes lesions in NS neurons of the lumbar spinal cord in the monkey and reduces the animals’ response to noxious cutaneous stimuli. The SSP-saporin administration to the lumbar spinal cord destroys a relatively small number of the total neurons that project into the somatosensory thalamus and does not lead to demonstrable changes in the inhibitory circuitry of the thalamus, in contrast to lesions of major pathways that lead to reductions in the thalamic inhibitory circuitry.",,

The primate thalamus is densely and heterogeneously innervated with dopaminergic axons, most of which express the dopamine transporter, as does the nigrostriatal system. We hypothesized that dopamine depletion may be present in the thalamus of the parkinsonian brain and set out to ascertain possible regional differences. The toxin 1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1,2,3,6‐tetrahydropyridine was administered to adult macaque monkeys using a slow intoxication protocol. The treated macaques were classified into 2 groups according to their motor status: nonsymptomatic and parkinsonian. Dopamine innervation was studied with immunohistochemistry for the dopamine transporter. Topographic maps of the dopamine transporter‐immunoreactive axon distribution were generated and the total length and length density of these axons stereologically estimated using a 3‐dimensional fractionator. Parkinsonian macaques exhibited lower dopamine transporter‐immunoreactive axon length density than controls in mediodorsal and centromedian‐parafascicular nuclei. Dopamine denervation in the mediodorsal nucleus was already noticeable in nonsymptomatic macaques and was even greater in parkinsonian macaques. Reticular nucleus dopamine transporter‐immunoreactive axon length density presented an inverse pattern, increasing progressively to the maximum density seen in parkinsonian macaques. No changes were observed in ventral thalamic nuclei. Dopamine transporter‐immunoreactive axon maps supported the quantitative findings. Changes in the dopamine innervation of various thalamic nuclei are heterogeneous and start in the premotor parkinsonian stage. These changes may be involved in some poorly understood nonmotor manifestations of PD. © 2019 The Authors.

Mutations in MCT8 or OATP1C1 result in severe disorders with dramatic movement disability related to alterations in basal ganglia motor circuits. Mapping the expression of MCT8/OATP1C1 in those circuits is necessary to explain their involvement in motor control. We studied the distribution of both transporters in the neuronal subpopulations that configure the direct and indirect basal ganglia motor circuits using immunohistochemistry and double/multiple labeling immunofluorescence for TH transporters and neuronal biomarkers. We found their expression in the medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum (the receptor neurons of the corticostriatal pathway) and in various types of its local microcircuitry interneurons, including the cholinergic. We also demonstrate the presence of both transporters in projection neurons of intrinsic and output nuclei of the basal ganglia, motor thalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, suggesting an important role of MCT8/OATP1C1 for modulating the motor system. Our findings suggest that a lack of function of these transporters in the basal ganglia circuits would significantly impact motor system modulation, leading to clinically severe movement impairment.","thyroid hormones, thyroid hormone transporters, MCT8, OATP1C1, human, monkey, basal ganglia, motor thalamus, MSN cells, nucleus basalis of Meynert",

As differences in cellular and synaptic thalamic organization would be expected to influence neuronal dendritic architecture, we compared somatosensory thalamocortical projection (TCP) neurons from the rat, cat and macaque. The results show that key features of the dendritic branching pattern remain unchanged despite large differences in the size of TCP neurons between the species. The features examined were: (i) ratio of the length of terminal branches to the lenght of the entire dendritic tree; (ii) the percentage of branch points that gave rise to two daughter branches as opposed to those that gave rise to three or more daughter branches; (iii) the proportional sum of absolute deviations (a measure of branching symmetry), and (iv) the mean branch order of the terminal segments. The present study provides evidence that somatosensory TCP neurons in these species comprise a homogeneous class and share a common dendritic architecture that is conserved across species despite changes in other aspects of thalamic circuitry. This suggests that TCP neuronal form is based on relatively stable genetic blueprint and that epigenetic factors (e.g. synaptic input) resulting from evolutionary changes in thalamic organization have had less influence on dendritic architecture.",Thalamus; Quantitative evaluation; Electrophysiology; Dendrite; Somatosensory system;,

This is the first investigation that explores the problem by direct comparison, in the same animal, of thalamic zones that (1) project to M1 and SMA and (2) receive cerebellar-nuclear (CN) and pallidal (GP) afferents. These four zones were mapped in two monkeys by means of two retrograde tracers for M1 and SMA injections and of two anterograde tracers for CN and GP injections. All injections were performed under electrophysiological control (microstimulation and multiunit recordings). Injections in cortical areas were restricted to the hand/arm representation; in the SMA, the tracer deposit was within the “SMA-proper” (or “area F3”) and did not include its rostral extension (“pre-SMA” or “area F6”). It was found that zones of all four types formed a number of highly complex patches of labeling that were usually not confined to one cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus. The overlap of clusters of labeled terminals and perikarya was evaluated morphometrically (area measurements) on a number of coronal sections along the anteroposterior extent of the motor thalamus. In line with previous studies, the thalamic territories innervated by CN and GP afferents rarely overlapped. However, zones projecting to M1 and/or to SMA included thalamic regions receiving CN as well as GP projections, providing the first evidence of such overlap from individual animals. The present observations support the previous conclusion from this laboratory (based on transsynaptic labeling) that the SMA receives, apart from its strong pallidal transthalamic input, a CN transthalamic input. These present findings that both M1 and SMA are recipients of transthalamic inputs from GP and CN thus support the concept that a mixed subcortical input consisting of weighted contributions from cerebellum, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and spinothalamic tract is directed to each functional component of the sensorimotor cortex. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Three such networks are centered on lateral orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal and cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex and all have been identified with distinct cognitive roles. Although these areas differ in a number of their cortical connections, some of the first anatomical evidence for these networks came from tracer studies demonstrating their distinct patterns of connectivity with the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus. Here, we present evidence for a similar topography of MD thalamus prefrontal connections, using non-invasive imaging and diffusion tractography (DWI–DT) in human and macaque. DWI–DT suggested that there was a high probability of interconnection between medial MD and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, between caudodorsal MD and medial frontal/cingulate cortex, and between lateral MD and lateral prefrontal cortex, in both species. Within the lateral prefrontal cortex a dorsolateral region (the principal sulcus in the macaque and middle frontal gyrus in the human) was found to have a high probability of interconnection with the MD region between the regions with a high probability of interconnection with other parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex and with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. In addition to suggesting that the thalamic connectivity in the macaque is a good guide to human prefrontal cortex, and therefore that there are likely to be similarities in the cognitive roles played by the prefrontal areas in both species, the present results are also the first to provide insight into the topography of projections of an individual thalamic nucleus in the human brain.","Anatomy, DTI, Human, Macaque, Thalamus",

Using three-dimensional reconstructions of electron microscopic images, we quantitatively characterize a GABAergic pathway that establishes synaptic contacts exclusively via multiple synapses. Axon terminals of the nigrothalamic pathway formed, on average, 8.5 synapses on large-diameter dendrites and somata of relay cells in the ventromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. All synapses of a given terminal converged on a single postsynaptic element. The vast majority of the synapses established by a single terminal were not separated by astrocytic processes. Nigrothalamic terminals in the macaque monkey showed the same ultrastructural features both in qualitative and quantitative terms (the median number of synapse per target was also 8.5). The individual synapses were closely spaced in both species. The nearest-neighbor synaptic distances were 169 nm in the rat and 178 nm in the monkey. The average number of synapses within 0.75 μm from any given synapse was 3.8 in the rat and 3.5 in the monkey. The arrangement of synapses described in this study creates favorable conditions for intersynaptic spillover of GABA among the multiple synapses of a single bouton, which can result in larger charge transfer. This could explain faithful and efficient GABAergic signal transmission in the nigrothalamic pathway in the healthy condition and during Parkinson's disease. In addition, our structural data suggest that the rodent nigrothalamic pathway can be a valid model of the primate condition, when the mechanism of GABAergic transmission is studied.","spillover, driver, axon terminal, active zone, substantia nigra, Parkinson's disease",

Biochemical studies have shown the presence of adrenaline or its biosynthetic enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, in the rat and human thalamus. However, the distribution of the adrenergic fibres in the thalamus has only been demonstrated in rats. We study the adrenergic innervation of the macaque monkey thalamus using immunohistochemistry against phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase. The distribution of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive fibres is markedly heterogeneous and principally restricted to those nuclei, or their portions, that are located in or close to the midline, with the highest density being found in the paraventricular, parafascicular and mediodorsal nuclei. The paraventricular nucleus is densely innervated by adrenergic axons throughout, while the densest innervation of the parafascicular nucleus is located in its medial part and the strongest mediodorsal nuclear immunolabelling is found in its most posterior and medial region. Moderate or low concentrations of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunopositive fibres are present in the paratenial nucleus, and all parts of the central nucleus, nucleus reuniens, central medial nucleus, centromedian nucleus, medial geniculate body and medial pulvinar nucleus, while only scattered immunoreactive axons are found in other thalamic nuclei. The morphology of the phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive axons is quite diverse, as they have different diameters and most are endowed with diversely-shaped varicosities. These findings are the first morphological evidence for the presence of adrenergic innervation in the primate thalamus and reveal that this innervation is highly selective, heterogeneous and more widely distributed in primates than in rats. The thalamic nuclei innervated by adrenaline are connected to widespread limbic and associative cortical areas as well as to subcortical structures, in particular the neostriatum and amygdala. We hypothesize that thalamic adrenaline may be implicated in emotional, social and attentional mechanisms through its facilitation of co-ordinated action by these brain regions.","adrenaline; PNMT; catecholamines; midline thalamic nuclei; mediodorsal; parafascicular; AD, anterodorsal nucleus; AM, anteromedial nucleus; AV, anteroventral nucleus; Cdc, central nucleus, densocellular part; CeM, central medial nucleus; Cif, central nucleus, inferior part; Cim, central nucleus, intermediate part; CL, central lateral nucleus; Clc, central nucleus, latocellular part; CnMd, centromedian nucleus; Cs, central nucleus, superior part; Csl, central nucleus, superior lateral part; GM, medial geniculate nucleus; IR, immunoreactive; Li, nucleus limitans; LP, lateral posterior nucleus; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; PNMT, phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase; Pt, paratenial nucleus; PulM, medial pulvinar nucleus; PulO, oral pulvinar nucleus; Pv, paraventricular nucleus; Pvc, caudal paraventricular nucleus; Re, nucleus reuniens; VP, ventral posterior nucleus;",

Horseradis peroxidase, have been used to elucidate the relationships between the reticular complex and the dorsal thalamus and cerebral cortex. Injections of tritiated amino acide in the dorsal thalamus or cerebrasl cortex in rate, cats and monkey, show that as the bundles of thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic fibers joining a paarticular dorsal thalamic nucleus to its associated area of the cerebral cortex traverse the reticular complex, they each give rise tp dense zone of terminals occupying a sector of reticular complex which is relatively constant for that dorsal thalamic nucleus and cortical area. However, because of the wide extent of the dendritic fields of the reticular cells and the degree of overlap between the sectors of the complex subtended by adjacent dorsal thalamic nuclei and adjacent cortical areas, it is likely that the reticular complex samples thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic activity in a somewhat unspecific manner. Fibers passing to the reticular complex from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus appear to be associated with the projection from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus appear to be associatied with the projection from the intralaminar nuclei to the striatu. Injections of tritiated amino acids in the reticular complex itself and injections of horseradish peroxidase in various other parts of the brain show that the only efferent pathway from thr reticular complex terminates in the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

The IL projects to more restricted parts of the ventral striatum (shell and core of nucleus accumbens, Acb; ventricular margin of caudate nucleus, CN), whereas the striatal projections of the prelimbic area (PL) are more extended than those of IL. The dorsal midline nuclei project densely to area 13, agranular insular cortex (Ia), and Acb. The nucleus ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis (VAmc) projects to the IL, perigenual area and to the region of CN between the limbic and association striatum with partial overlapping, and seems to play a role as an interface between the limbic and motor systems. The distribution pattern of retrogradely labeled neurons was similar in the midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei following injections in the IL and ventral striatum.",,

Here, a method based on dynamic programming (DP) is introduced to reconstruct fibers pathways whose complex anatomical structures cannot be resolved beyond the resolution of standard DTI data. DP is based on optimizing a sequentially additive cost function derived from a Gaussian diffusion model whose covariance is defined by the diffusion tensor. DP is used to determine the optimal path between initial and terminal nodes by efficiently searching over all paths, connecting the nodes, and choosing the path in which the total probability is maximized. An ex vivo high-resolution scan of a macaque hemi-brain is used to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of DP. DP can generate fiber bundles between distant cortical areas (superior longitudinal fasciculi, arcuate fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and fronto-occipital fasciculus), neighboring cortical areas (dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus), as well as cortical projections to the hippocampal formation (cingulum bundle), neostriatum (motor cortical projections to the putamen), thalamus (subcortical bundle), and hippocampal formation projections to the mammillary bodies via the fornix. Validation is established either by comparison with in vivo intracellular transport of horseradish peroxidase in another macaque monkey or by comparison with atlases. DP is able to generate known pathways, including crossing and kissing tracts. Thus, DP has the potential to enhance neuroimaging studies of cortical connectivity.",,

These three neuron groups show different distributions in depth from pia to white matter and differ in their relationship to zones of concentrated termination of geniculo-cortical axons. The neuron type most closely related to the laminae receiving a heavy geniculo-cortical projection is the spinous stellate cell. This cell type is restricted to lamina IV. Included in this zone is the broadest band of geniculo-cortical axon projection (lamina IVC), the horizontal fiber band (lamina IVB) comprising the major portion of the stria of Gennari (receiving little or no thalamic projection) and the narrow band of thalamo-cortical fiber termination which occurs superficial to the stria of Gennari (lamina IVA). Pyramidal neuron cell bodies are almost totally excluded from lamina IVC and the apical dendrites of lower pyramidal neurons bear many fewer spines in lamina IVC than in laminae V and VI. The basal dendrites of upper pyramidal cells spread superficial and deep to lamina IVA rather than within it. Spine-free stellate neurons occur at all cortical levels and sparselyspined varieties have not been impregnated in lamina IV, but occur in the other laminae. Three groups of presumed thalamo-cortical axons have been identified, two of which resemble each other in morphology (having long collaterals which appear to terminate by means of spine-like projections of the axonal surface) but not in distribution. One group of these axons bearing spine-like projections distributes in laminae IVC (principally in the deeper half, IVCβ) and IVA; the other is restricted in distribution to the upper half of lamina IVC (IVCα). The third group of thalamo-cortical axons distributes to lamina I and appears to lack the spine-like projections shown by the other two axon groups.",,

In each session, the monkey learned a new list of these unique scenes. The animals then underwent surgical ablation of either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the cingulate cortex. It was found that the animals with anterior thalamic lesions showed a substantial impairment, whereas the monkeys with cingulate cortex ablations were not significantly impaired at the task.

In the primate thalamus, a newly identified population of neurons provides a basis for this synchronization.

In some nuclei, a core of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons is superimposed upon the matrix. Core neurons project in a topographically ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner.

Disease-triggered pathological processes in the basal ganglia can compromise any of these pathways either directly or indirectly, yet the effects of basal ganglia lesioning on its thalamic afferent-receiving territories has not been studied in primates. Two GABAA receptor ligands, [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, were used to study the distribution and binding properties of the receptor in intact monkeys, those with kainic acid lesions in the globus pallidus, and those with ibotenic acid lesions in the reticular nucleus using quantitative autoradiographic technique on cryostat sections of fresh frozen brain tissue. In control monkeys the binding affinities for [3H]muscimol averaged 50 nM in the thalamic nuclei and 86 nM in the basal ganglia while the binding densities varied (maximum density of binding sites [Bmax] range of 99.4–1000.1 fmol/mg of tissue). Binding affinities and Bmax values for [3H]flunitrazepam averaged 2.02 nM and 81–113 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively. Addition of 100-μM GABA increased average affinity to 1.35 nM whereas Bmax values increased anywhere from 1–50% in different nuclei. Zolpidem (100 nM) decreased binding by 68–80%. Bmax values for both ligands were decreased at the two survival times in both medial and lateral globus pallidus implying involvement of both nuclei in the lesion. Statistically significant, 40% decrease (P=0.055) of Bmax for [3H]muscimol was observed in the ventral anterior nucleus pars densicellularis (VAdc, the main pallidal projection territory in the thalamus) 1 week after globus pallidus lesioning and a 36% decrease (P=0.017) 4 months post-lesioning. In contrast, [3H]flunitrazepam Bmax values in the VAdc of the same animals were increased by 23% (P=0.021) at 1 week and 28% (P=0.005) 4 months postlesion, respectively. One week after the reticular nucleus lesioning, the binding densities of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam were decreased in the thalamic nuclei receiving projections from the lesioned reticular nucleus sector by approximately 50% (P<0.05) and 10–33% (P<0.05), respectively.

The DLG projects only to striate cortex. These projections are retinotopically organized, and do not extend to any cortical layers above layer IVA. In contrast the inferior pulvinar (PI) and the immediately adjacent portion of the lateral pulvinar (PLα48) project to both striate and prestriate cortex. The projections from these two thalamic areas to the striate cortex are also retinotopically organized and exist in parallel with those from the DLG. In contrast to the DLG, the projections from PI and PLα terminate above layer IVA in striate cortex, i.e. layers I, II and III. In prestriate cortex the layers of termination include layers IV, III and I. The pulvinar terminations in layers II and III of area 17 occur in segregated patches as do the geniculate terminations in layers IVC and IVA. On the other hand the pulvinar terminations in layer I which overlie those in layers II and III of area 17 appeared to be continuous. Control studies show that the remainder of the lateral pulvinar overlying PLα does not project to striate cortex. It is concluded that there are 3 visuotopically organized inputs from the lateral thalamus to primary visual cortex and that each of these inputs have different layers of termination. The inputs from PI and DLG can convey direct retinal inputs while those from PI and PLα can also be involved in intrinsic cortico-thalamocortical connections with prestriate cortex. It remains, then, that it cannot be tacitly assumed that the ascending inputs which influence the response properties of the primary cortical neurons arise solely from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. It is also argued that these inputs to the supragranular layers may be excitatory as those from the DLG to the IVth layer.",,

The dense plexus of calbindin-immunoreactive fibres that characterizes VMpo in primates enables its homologue to be identified in the human thalamus by immunohistochemical labelling for calbindin. We have now analysed in detail the cytoarchitectonic characteristics of VMpo and its relationship with immunoreactivity for calbindin, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the human thalamus. The area in the posterolateral thalamus in which dense calbindin-immunoreactive fibre terminations are present coincides nearly completely with a distinct region that contains small to medium-sized cells with round or oval shapes that are aggregated in clusters separated by cell sparse areas. This region, which we identify as VMpo, is located posteromedial to the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei, ventral to the anterior pulvinar and centre médian nuclei, lateral to the limitans and parafascicular nuclei and dorsal to the medial geniculate nucleus. Calbindin-immunoreactive fibres enter VMpo from the spinal lemniscus and form large patches of dense terminal-like staining over clusters of VMpo neurons. A few of these clusters also display terminal-like substance P labelling. Small bursts of CGRP staining are intercalated between the calbindin-labelled clusters, but there is little or no overlap between these two markers. CGRP immunoreactivity is also present over small, non-clustered neurons in the calbindin-negative area that separates VMpo from the VPL and VPM nuclei, which we denote as the posterior nucleus (Po). These observations provide a concise description of VMpo in the human thalamus. Further, they suggest that the lamina I spinothalamic tract fibres (represented by calbindin and probably also substance P immunoreactivity) and vagal-solitary-parabrachial afferents (represented by CGRP immunoreactivity) form closely related, but separate, termination fields that can be considered to represent different aspects of enteroceptive information regarding the physiological status of the tissues and organs of the body. The location of VMpo and the adjacent Po fits with clinical descriptions of the thalamic area from which pain, temperature and visceral sensations can be evoked by microstimulation, and where nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons have been recorded in humans. It also corresponds to the area in which infarcts cause analgesia and thermoanaesthesia and can lead to the paradoxical development of central pain.",spinothalamic tract; posterior complex; calbindin; calcitonin gene-related peptide; substance P;,

These signals are important for postural and oculomotor control, as well as for spatial and bodily perception and cognition, and they are subtended by pathways running from the vestibular nuclei to the thalamus, cerebellum and the “vestibular cortex.” The present review summarizes current knowledge on the anatomy of the thalamocortical vestibular system and discusses data from electrophysiology and neuroanatomy in animals by comparing them with data from neuroimagery and neurology in humans. Multiple thalamic nuclei are involved in vestibular processing, including the ventroposterior complex, the ventroanterior–ventrolateral complex, the intralaminar nuclei and the posterior nuclear group (medial and lateral geniculate nuclei, pulvinar). These nuclei contain multisensory neurons that process and relay vestibular, proprioceptive and visual signals to the vestibular cortex. In non-human primates, the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) has been proposed as the core vestibular region. Yet, vestibular responses have also been recorded in the somatosensory cortex (area 2v, 3av), intraparietal sulcus, posterior parietal cortex (area 7), area MST, frontal cortex, cingulum and hippocampus. We analyze the location of the corresponding regions in humans, and especially the human PIVC, by reviewing neuroimaging and clinical work. The widespread vestibular projections to the multimodal human PIVC, somatosensory cortex, area MST, intraparietal sulcus and hippocampus explain the large influence of vestibular signals on self-motion perception, spatial navigation, internal models of gravity, one's body perception and bodily self-consciousness.",,

In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.",,

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into medial and midline thalamic sites in five animals, and tritiated amino acids were injected into selected amygdaloid regions in a total of 13 hemispheres in ten animals. The findings from the two types of tracer experiments demonstrated the origins, course, and terminal pattern of amygdaloid projections to two thalamic nuclei – medialis dorsalis (MD) and reuniens. Almost all of the amygdaloid nuclei contribute projections to MD, though the greatest proportion arise from the basal group and terminate in discrete, interlocking patches within the medial, magnocellular portion of MD. In addition to this major projection, the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei send a lighter projection to the lateral portion of nucleus reuniens. The amygdalothalamic projections took a variety of routes out of the amygdala before the large majority joined the interior thalamic peduncle and entered the rostral head of the thalamus where they turned caudally toward their targets. A small number of amygdalothalamic fibers may also run in the stria terminalis.",,

Here we examine whether such convergence occurs subcortically in the macaque thalamus. We searched the ventral posterior nuclei, including the anterior pulvinar, as well as the ventro-lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, areas that receive vestibular signals from brain stem and deep cerebellar nuclei. Approximately a quarter of cells responded to three-dimensional (3D) translational and/or rotational motion. More than half of the responsive cells were convergent, thus responded during both rotation and translation. The preferred axes of translation/rotation were distributed throughout 3D space. The majority of the neurons were excited, but some were inhibited, during rotation/translation in darkness. Only a couple of neurons were multisensory being tuned to both vestibular and optic flow stimuli. We conclude that multisensory vestibular/optic flow neurons, which are commonly found in cortical visual and visuomotor areas, are rare in the ventral posterior thalamus.",,

Nissl and acetylcholinesterase-stained sections revealed a parcellation of the nuclei that could be correlated with that used in the macaque monkey thalamus. Human nuclei were accordingly re-named using the monkey nomenclature. Apart from differences of size, the nuclei of the human and monkey thalamus are remarkably similar. In the human ventral nuclear complex there is a very clear histochemical distinction between nuclei which, on the basis of comparison with the monkey, probably form the pallidal, cerebellar and lemniscal relays to premotor, motor and somatic sensory cortex, respectively. In the human somatic sensory relay nucleus there is a further clear cytoarchitectonic distinction between components that are probably equivalent to the relays for deep and cutaneous receptors in the equivalent monkey nucleus.",Thalamus; Human; Nucleus; Histochemistry;,

For this purpose, the left motorcortex was exposed in three animals under narcosis. By electrical brain stimulation, sites were identified yielding vocal fold adduction. Effective sites were injected with the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine. Subcortical projections could be traced within the forebrain to the putamen, caudate nucleus, claustrum, zona incerta, field H of Forel and a number of thalamic nuclei, with the heaviest projections to the nuclei ventralis lateralis, ventralis posteromedialis, including its parvocellular part, medialis dorsalis, centralis medialis, centrum medianum and reuniens. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep mesencephalic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, fibers terminated in the pontine and medullary reticular formation, locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract nucleus and facial nucleus. No projections were found to the nucl. ambiguus.

GABAB transcript expression was widespread and of much higher density in the dorsal thalamus than in the reticular nucleus and other parts of the ventral thalamus and was highest in the epithalamus. In the dorsal thalamus, highest mRNA levels were found in the anteroventral nucleus and in the parafascicular nucleus. Sensory relay nuclei showed moderate GABAB mRNA levels. Neurons of all sizes were labeled, suggesting expression in relay cells and interneurons, and there was no labeling of neuroglial cells. Following 10-day periods of monocular deprivation, levels of GABAB mRNA were decreased in the deprived magno- and parvo-cellular laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, indicating activity-dependent regulation. High levels of GABAB receptors in the dorsal thalamus are likely to reflect the high density of synaptic inputs from the reticular nucleus while low expression in the reticular nucleus implies weak, GABAB-mediated intrareticular inhibition.

Electrolytic lesions were placed within the ventral posterior nuclear complex of ten rhesus monkeys, all under barbiturate anesthesia, and the effects of the lesions on the cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of the contralateral lingual and hypoglossal nerves were observed. In addition, activity in response to hypoglossal and lingual nerve volleys was recorded from the ventral posterior nuclear complex. Both sets of data were consistent in indicating that hypoglossal afferents project to a restricted region of the nucleus ventralis posteromedialis which is confined to the anterodorsal portion of the nucleus. In contrast, the lingual nerve representation, as has been shown in other studies, occupies a much greater volume of VPM. The relationship between the lingual and hypoglossal nerve projections in VPM was discussed with respect to the relation shown to exist between superficial and deep modality projections in the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis.",,

The long held view that the thalamus serves as a simple hi fidelity relay station for sensory information to the cortex, however, has over recent years been dispelled. Indeed, multiple projections from the vestibular nuclei to thalamic nuclei (including the ventrobasal nuclei, and the geniculate bodies)- regions typically associated with other modalities- have been described. Further, some thalamic neurons have been shown to respond to stimuli presented from across sensory modalities. For example, neurons in the rat anterodorsal and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus respond to visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and somatosensory stimuli and integrate this information to compute heading within the environment. Together, these findings imply that the thalamus serves crucial integrative functions, at least in regard to vestibular processing, beyond that imparted by a “simple” relay. In this mini review we outline the vestibular inputs to the thalamus and provide some clinical context for vestibular interactions in the thalamus. We then focus on how vestibular inputs interact with other sensory systems and discuss the multisensory integration properties of the thalamus.","vestibular, thalamus, LGN, multisensory integration, vestibular nuclei",

A belt-like organization of the auditory region with a koniocortex core (corresponding to AI) surrounded by belt areas was revealed. This organization principally resembled that of the auditory region of the cat (Rose and Woolsey, 1949; Woolsey, 1961) and that of other sensory regions (Sanides, 1972; Sanides and Krishnamurti, 1967). The belt is composed of one prokoniocortex area (proA, corresponding to AII) in parinsular location and of a caudal (paAc), lateral (paAlt) and rostral (paAr) parakoniocortex area. The latter has a particular character. It was found to be the target of thalamic projections of the caudalmost portion of GMpc. In contrast to the other parakonio areas it does not receive associations of the koniocortex. The belt areas, including the prokoniocortex, are ipsilaterally and transcallosally interconnected as in the somatic sensory (Jones and Powell, 1969a, b; Pandya and Kuypers, 1969; Pandya and Vignolo, 1969) and visual regions (Myers, 1962; Kuypers et al., 1965; Karol and Pandya, 1971). The koniocortex core is formed by two areas, Kam and Kalt, corresponding to the architectonic organization hitherto only known in man. The medial area (Kam) has a large number of homotopical callosal projections except at its medial border (to proA). The lateral area receives less callosal fibers, particularly most of its lateral portion is devoid of terminations. Since the belt areas are rich in callosal projections the supratemporal plane shows a pattern of three stripes of callosal terminations with two intermittent stripes void of terminations. While the projections of the koniocortex into the belt areas terminate prevalently in layer IV, the parakoniocortex sends fibers only into layers I and II of the koniocortex. This corresponds to results in somatic sensory (Pandya and McKenna, unpublished observations) and visual regions (Kuypers et al., 1965; Sanides and Vitzthum, 1965b; Spatz, personal communication). In contrast to other sensory regions the auditory koniocortex receives its exceptionally dense, homotopic callosal connections in the whole outer stratum with emphasis on layer III, as opposed to layer IV in the somatic sensory region.",,

Each area of prefrontal, premotor, or motor cortex injected was found to receive a topographically unique thalamic input from clusters of cells in specific subdivisions within MD. All of the prefrontal areas examined also receive topographically organized inputs from other thalamic nuclei including, most prominently, the ventral anterior (VA) and medial pulvinar nuclei. Conversely, and in agreement with previous findings, MD projects to areas of the frontal lobe beyond the traditional borders of prefrontal cortex, such as the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The topography of thalamocortical neurons revealed in coronal sections through VA, MD, and pulvinar is circumferential. In the medial part of MD, for example, thalamocortical neurons shift from a dorsal to a ventral position for cortical targets lying medial to lateral along the ventral surface of the lobe; neurons in the lateral MD move from a ventral to a dorsal position, for cortical areas situated lateral to medial on the convexity of the hemisphere. The aggregate evidence for topographic specificity is supported further by experiments in which different fluorescent dyes were placed in multiple areas of the frontal lobe in each of three cases. The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex. The widespread cortical targets of MD neurons together with evidence for multiple thalamic inputs to prefrontal areas support a revision of the classical hodological definition of prefrontal cortex as the exclusive cortical recipient of MD projections. Rather, the prefrontal cortex is defined by multiple specific relationships with the thalamus.",,

It was found that the prestriate cortex projected to the entire inferior pulvinar (PI), lateral pulvinar (PL), dorsolateral nucleus, the lateral posterior nucleus, the reticular nucleus, a portion of the medial pulvinar, superior colliculus, and caudate nucleus but not to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The projections to the PI were organized according to the topographical representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. The ventral portion of the PL which is immediately adjacent to the PI also received a parallel topographical projection in register with the representation of the visual hemifield and thus is distinguished from the remainder of the PL. The dorsal and caudal portions of the PL (which extend to form the lateral portion of the caudal pole of the pulvinar and are located away from PI) also received projections from prestriate cortex which often appeared as several bands of grains. However, although dorsal prestriate cortex seemed to project to the dorsal portion of caudal PL and ventral prestriate cortex seemed to project to the ventral portion of caudal PL, any further topography in the projections to the dorsal and caudal PL as well as any to the other dorsal group nuclei was difficult to determine. The results point to the conclusion that the PI and the immediately adjacent portion of PL are distinguished from the remainder of the pulvinar by their connectional organization, and each region contains a representation of the visual hemifield. Furthermore, the prestriate projections to these and other regions of the pulvinar form the corticothalamic half of visual and visuomotor cortico-thalamocortical projections which involve all the occipital cortices (areas 17, 18 and 19) as well as inferotemporal, parietal and frontal cortices.",,

The frontal lobe has connections with several different cortical and subcortical regions. The chapter focuses on the role of cortical connections and discusses about thalamic connections. The adaptation of organisms to increasingly complex conditions is reflected in concomitant morphological features of the brain and of the frontal lobe in particular. During evolution, the frontal lobe has undergone marked increases in relative size and complexity, reaching its highest levels in primates. These changes are expressed in terms of cellular architecture and connectional organization. The concept of the dual origin of the cerebral cortex begins with the proposition that there are two prime moieties from which all cortical regions have evolved—the archicortical (or hippocampal) and the paleocortical (or olfactory). The dual organizational trends with sequential progression from the rudimentary cortices toward highly developed frontal regions may provide a framework for further experimental studies. Based on anatomical, physiological, and behavioral studies, there are two cortical visual systems: a (1) ventral system engaged in object analysis and (2) a dorsal system involved in visuospatial function.",,

Following injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the orbital prefrontal cortex, the gyrus rectus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus of the frontal lobe, labeled neurons were found in the basolateral, basomedial, or basal accessory nuclei of the amygdala. None of these nuclei contained labeled neurons following HRP injections into the principal sulcus or the lateral inferior convexity of the frontal lobe. This selective distribution of amygdala connections was confirmed by injecting tritiated amino acids into the amygdala. Silver grains were present only over the orbital cortex and gyrus rectus on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe and over the superior prefrontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus on the medial wall of the hemisphere, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was free of radioactivity. The isotope injection of the amygdala also revealed a projection to the magnocellular moeity of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmc) which is known to innervate the same ventromedial regions of the frontal lobe that receive direct connections from the amygdala. Although MDmc and amygdala project to the same cortical regions, their terminal fields are different. The direct amygdala input terminates in layer 1 in orbital cortex and gyrus rectus and layer 2 in the dorsomedial cortex and cingulate gyrus, while the thalamic input is primarily to layer 3 and, in some areas, also to the superficial half of layer 1. These findings indicate that the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys can be subdivided into two separable cortical regions:(1) A ventromedial region including the anterior cingulate gyrus which receives both direct (amygdalo-cortical) and indirect (amygdalo-thalamo-cortical) input from the amygdala; and (2) a dorsolateral frontal region which is essentially devoid of either direct or indirect amygdalofugal axons. On the basis of its selective relationship with the amygdala, the ventromedial region may be considered the “limbic” portion of the frontal association cortex.",,

Most terminal boutons were small (<1 μm), except some large boutons (2–6 μm) located in PO and vMGB.

High concentration of isoflurane resulted in global CBF increase and blood pressure decrease. Evident CBF change was observed in the subcortical structures. Specifically, CBF in thalamus and cerebellum was increased about 39% and 55% when isoflurane concentration was changed from 0.75% to 1.5%, respectively. Also, those regional CBF changes correlated linearly with isoflurane inspiratory concentrations, indicating impaired CBF autoregulation in these structures. In contrast, no obvious CBF changes were observed in anterior cingulated cortex, motor cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and caudate. The results demonstrate that, under the 0.75–1.5% isoflurane maintenance doses, the CBF auto-regulation is well preserved in the cerebral cortical regions and caudate, but impaired in thalamus and cerebellum, indicating disturbed CBF-metabolism coupling and functional response in specific subcortical regions of anesthetized macaque monkeys.","Dose-dependent effect, Isoflurane, Cerebral blood flow (CBF), auto-regulation, non-human primate, arterial spin labeling(ASL)",

Interposed between the thalamus and cortex, the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus intercepts and regulates communication between the two structures. Recent findings demonstrate that a unique circuitry links the prefrontal cortex with the reticular nucleus and may underlie the process of selective attention to enhance salient stimuli and suppress irrelevant stimuli in behavior. Unlike other cortices, some prefrontal areas issue widespread projections to the reticular nucleus, extending beyond the frontal sector to the sensory sectors of the nucleus and may influence the flow of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex. Unlike other thalamic nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus, which is the principal thalamic nucleus for the prefrontal cortex, has similarly widespread connections with the reticular nucleus. Unlike sensory association cortices, some terminations from prefrontal areas to the reticular nucleus are large, suggesting efficient transfer of information. We propose a model showing that the specialized features of prefrontal pathways in the reticular nucleus may allow selection of relevant information and override distractors, in processes that are deranged in schizophrenia.","corticothalamic projections, dual mode of termination, drivers and modulators, inhibitory control, overlap of terminations, mediodorsal nucleus, association cortices",

The rostral globus pallidus and the rostral substantia nigra in the same hemisphere were injected simultaneously with fluorescent tracers in three monkeys. In addition, the caudal globus pallidus and the caudal substantia nigra were injected separately in a fourth and fifth monkey with a fluorescent dye and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), respectively. Digitized plots of fluorescent dye-labeled neurons revealed that large numbers of striatonigral projection neurons lie within both neostriatal nuclei, i.e., the caudate and putamen. Similarly, neurons innervating the globus pallidus were found in both caudate and putamen. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons observed was consistent with the topography of striatofugal projections that has been described previously, i.e., the rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes of the neostriatum are preserved in the striatopallidal and striatonigral projections (e.g., Szabo, '62, '67, 70, '72) and the dorsoventral axis is inverted in the projection of the neostriatum onto the nigra but not in the striatopallidal projection (Nauta and Domesick, '79; Gerfen, '85). Analysis of cases in which striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons were present in large numbers within the same region of the neostriatum disclosed that the two populations are intermingled such that small clusters of striatopallidal neurons are surrounded by striatonigral neurons and vice versa. The clustered arrangement of striatofugal neurons observed in the fluorescent cases was unambiguous in a case in which HRP was injected into the caudal substantia nigra. In this case, both anterogradely labeled terminals and retrogradely labeled neurons exhibited a striking, compartmental-like distribution in the posterior putamen. Our observations indicate that the matrix compartment of the neostriatum is comprised of a patchwork of interposed clusters of nigral and pallidal efferent neurons. We hypothesize that these clusters of efferent neurons may direct interdigitated cortical inputs into distinct nigro-and pallido-thalamic pathways. In view of the parallel nature of processing throughout the basal ganglia, it appears that convergence of these segregated nigral and pallidal loops must occur at the cortical level where prefrontal and premotor targets of the basal ganglia are interconnected via corticocortical projections (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, '88).",,

In normal weight monkeys (2.4-4.1 kg body wt), the average concentration of MeHg (calculated as T-Hg minus I-Hg) was about the same in all brain sites, except the pituitary-3.0 μg Hg/g at 6 months, 4.2 μg/g at 12 months, and 4.3 μg Hg/g at 18 months. MeHg concentrations in the pituitary were about 50% of those in the other brain sites. In a group of monkeys that were kept unexposed for 6 months following 12 months of MeHg exposure, T
for MeHg was about 37 days in all brain sites, with the exception of the pituitary, where it was shorter. The concentration of I-Hg increased in all brain sites, but especially in the thalamus and pituitary, with the time of MeHg exposure. In most brain sites, I-Hg constituted about 9% of T-Hg at 6 and 12 months, and 12% of T-Hg at 18 months. In the pituitary, I-Hg increased from 20% of T-Hg at 6 months to 46% at 18 months. Elimination T
for I-Hg was extremely long, 230-540 days in most brain sites and considerably longer in the thalamus and pituitary. The concentration of I-Hg in the thalamus did not decrease during the clearance period (6 months), while I-Hg in the pituitary continued to increase in spite of no additional exposure. The MeHg exposed monkeys had several times higher I-Hg concentrations in the brain than monkeys exposed to HgCl2, indicating that I-Hg was formed by demethylation of MeHg in the brain, and not by brain uptake of I-Hg formed by demethylation elsewhere in the body. There were large variations in the relative concentration of I-Hg between individual monkeys, but not between brain sites (except thalamus and pituitary). Obese monkeys (5.0-6.1 kg body wt) exposed to MeHg had higher concentrations of both MeHg and I-Hg than normal weight monkeys in all brain sites, except in the pituitary.",,

Both LIP and 7a received the majority of their thalamic input from contiguous but distinct zones within the medial pulvinar nucleus. Thalamocortical cell bodies that projected to LIP were arranged in a dense, horizontally oriented cluster that was sandwiched between two similar clusters of neurons that projected to 7a.

Each functional region of the frontal cortex is connected with specific areas of each basal ganglia (BG) structure and of the thalamus. In addition, the thalamus sends a massive, topographically organized projection directly to the striatum. Tract-tracing and physiological experiments have indicated a general topographic organization of the cortical-BG-thalamic loops and supported a model of BG function based on parallel and segregated pathways. However, the learning and execution of appropriate behavioral responses require integration of inputs related to emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical functions. Our recent data indicate that integration may occur via non-reciprocal connections between the striatum and substantia nigra and within “hot spots” of convergence between cortico-striatal projections from different functional regions. Similarly, integration may exist in the thalamus. There are non-reciprocal connections between the thalamus and cortex via thalamocortical projections that terminate in the superficial and deep cortical layers. These terminals can influence different functional cortical areas that, in turn, project to the striatum and back to the thalamus. In addition, a non-reciprocal corticothalamic projection terminates in thalamic regions that are parts of other circuits. Finally, ‘hot spots’ of convergence between terminals from different cortical regions may also occur in the thalamus as is seen in the striatum. Thus, via several different pathways, the thalamus may serve as an important center of integration of networks that underlie the ability to modulate behaviors.",,

Experimental neuroanatomical studies by the aid of the Nauta method have demonstrated that ascending projections from the cerebellum form the most widely distributed single subcortical afferent system impinging on the thalamus in the primate brain. Cerebello-thalamic fibers terminate throughout all subdivisions of the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) nuclei and, in addition, compose the most massive of the known afferent connections of the intralaminar nucleus centralis lateralis.

A previous study showed that neuron number in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is reduced following early gestational exposure to x- irradiation (Algan and Rakic, 1997). Here we examine whether similarly timed irradiation decreases neuron number in three associational thalamic nuclei: mediodorsal (MD), anterior, and pulvinar. Ten macaques were exposed to multiple doses of x-rays (total exposure: 175–350cGy) in early (E33-E42) or midgestation (E70-E90); 8 non-irradiated macaques were controls. Only the early irradiated monkeys, not the midgestationally irradiated animals, exhibited deficits in whole thalamic neuron (−15%) and glia numbers (−21%) compared to controls. Reduction of neuron number (−26%) and volume (−29%) was particularly pronounced in MD. In contrast, cell number and volume were not significantly decreased in the anterior or pulvinar nuclei following early gestational irradiation. Thus, reduced thalamic neuron number was associated specifically with irradiation in early gestation. Persistence of the thalamic neuronal deficit in adult animals indicates that prenatally deleted neurons had not been replenished during maturation or in adulthood. The selective reduction of MD neuron number also supports the protomap hypothesis that neurons of each thalamic nucleus originate sequentially from separate lines of neuronal stem cells (Rakic, 1977a). The early gestationally irradiated macaque is discussed as a potentially useful model for studying the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia.","anterior nucleus, pulvinar nucleus, neurodevelopment, stereology, schizophrenia",

Resulting degeneration was studied by the Wiitanen technic in transverse and sagittal sections. Ascending nigral efferents project into Forel's field H where they divide into medial and lateral bundles. Fibers of the medial bundle terminate in portions of the ventral lateral (VLm) and ventral anterior (VAmc) thalamic nuclei. Quantitatively larger numbers of fibers project laterally dorsal to, and within, the subthalamic nucleus. These nigral efferents traverse the internal capsule and globus pallidus to enter the putamen (P) and parts of the caudate nucleus (CN). Nigral efferent fibers in the globus pallidus appeared entirely en passage. The location of degeneration in the putamen appeared related to the part of the SN destroyed. An apparent correspondence exists between: (1) lateral parts of SN and dorsal regions of P, and (2) medial parts of SN and ventral regions of P. The pars reticularis of SN gives rise to nigrothalamic fibers while nigrostriatal fibers arise from the pars compacta. Data suggest that reciprocal topographic relationships may exist between nigrostriatal and strionigral projections and that these fibers appear to form a closed feedback loop concerned with dopamine transport.

The results indicated that ventral precallosal and subcallosal areas 14 and 25, and the ventral, subcallosal part of area 32, all receive projections from the mediodorsal portion of the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDmc). The dorsal, precallosal part of area 32 receives projections mainly from the dorsal portion of the parvocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDpc), which also provides some input to area 14. Polar area 10 receives input from both MDpc and the densocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDdc), as does supracallosal area 24. Area 24 receives additional input from the anterior medial nucleus and midline nuclei. All medial prefrontal cortical areas were also found to receive projections from a number of cortical regions within the temporal lobe, such as the temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Areas 24, 25, and 32 receive, in addition, input from the entorhinal cortex. Combining these results with prior anatomical and behavioral data, we conclude that medial temporal areas that are important for object recognition memory send information directly both to dorsal medial prefrontal areas 24 and 32 and to ventral medial prefrontal areas 14 and 25. Only the latter two areas have additional access to this information via projections from the mediodorsal part of MDmc.",,

We investigated how multiple projection systems to the thalamus are organized in prefrontal cortex after injection of distinct retrograde tracers in the principal mediodorsal (MD), the limbic anterior medial (AM), and the motor-related ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Neurons projecting to these nuclei were organized in interdigitated modules extending vertically within layers VI and V. Projection neurons were also organized in layers. The majority of projection neurons to MD or AM originated in layer VI (~80%), but a significant proportion (~20%) originated in layer V. In contrast, prefrontal neurons projecting to VA/VL were equally distributed in layers V and VI. Neurons directed to VA/VL occupied mostly the upper part of layer V, while neurons directed to MD or AM occupied mostly the deep part of layer V. The highest proportions of projection neurons in layer V to each nucleus were found in dorsal and medial prefrontal areas. The laminar organization of prefrontal cortico-thalamic projections differs from sensory systems, where projections originate predominantly or entirely from layer VI. Previous studies indicate that layer V cortico-thalamic neurons innervate through some large terminals thalamic neurons that project widely to superficial cortical layers. The large population of prefrontal projection neurons in layer V may drive thalamic neurons, triggering synchronization by recruiting several cortical areas through widespread thalamo-cortical projections to layer I. These pathways may underlie the synthesis of cognition, emotion and action.","Macaca mulatta, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, anterior thalamic nuclei, layer V pyramidal neurons, cortico-thalamic pathway",

Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the highcontrast receptive field sizes of the column’s neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.",,

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AI, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in AI and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas AI and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds. J. Comp. Neurol. 382:89-103, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss Inc.",,

In rats and mice RE is distinguished by bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a role in memory and cognition. In primates, many foundational questions pertaining to RE remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by investigating the composition of the rhesus monkey RE in both sexes by labeling for GABA, a marker of inhibitory neurons, and for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR), which label thalamic excitatory neurons that project to cortex. As in rats and mice, the macaque RE was mostly populated by CB and CR neurons, characteristic of matrix-dominant nuclei, and had bidirectional connections with hippocampus and mPFC area 25 (A25). Unlike rodents, we found GABAergic neurons in the monkey RE and a sparser but consistent population of core-associated thalamocortical PV neurons. RE had stronger connections with the basal amygdalar complex than in rats or mice. Amygdalar terminations were enriched with mitochondria and frequently formed successive synapses with the same postsynaptic structures, suggesting an active and robust pathway to RE. Significantly, hippocampal pathways formed multisynaptic complexes that uniquely involved excitatory projection neurons and dendrites of local inhibitory neurons in RE, extending this synaptic principle beyond sensory to high-order thalamic nuclei. Convergent pathways from hippocampus, A25, and amygdala in RE position it to flexibly coordinate activity for memory, cognition, and emotional context, which are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases in humans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The primate RE is a central node for memory and cognition through connections with the hippocampus and mPFC. As in rats or mice, the primate RE is a matrix-dominant thalamic nucleus, suggesting signal traffic to the upper cortical layers. Unlike rats or mice, the primate RE contains inhibitory neurons, synaptic specializations with the hippocampal pathway, and robust connections with the amygdala, suggesting unique adaptations. Convergence of hippocampal, mPFC, and amygdalar pathways in RE may help unravel a circuit basis for binding diverse signals for conscious flexible behaviors and the synthesis of memory with affective significance in primates, whereas disruption of distinct circuit nodes may occur in psychiatric disorders in humans.","consciousness, core/matrix, inhibitory neurons, macaque, midline thalamus, mice, rats, triads",

The innervation of distinct visual cortical areas by the thalamus is especially segregated in primates, such that the lateral geniculate (LG) nucleus specifically innervates striate cortex, whereas pulvinar projections are confined to extrastriate cortex 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The molecular bases for the parcellation of the visual cortex and thalamus, as well as the establishment of reciprocal connections between distinct compartments within these two structures, are largely unknown. Here, we show that prospective visual cortical areas and corresponding thalamic nuclei in the embryonic rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) can be defined by combinatorial expression of genes encoding Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, prior to obvious cytoarchitectonic differentiation within the cortical plate and before the establishment of reciprocal connections between the cortical plate and thalamus. These results indicate that molecular patterns of presumptive visual compartments in both the cortex and thalamus can form independently of one another and suggest a role for EphA family members in both compartment formation and axon guidance within the visual thalamocortical system.",,

In 2 macaque monkeys, 6 neuroanatomical tracers were injected in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex (PE/PEa in area 5), and dorsal and ventral premotor cortical areas (PMd, PMv), demonstrating the existence of overlapping territories of thalamic projections to areas of different modalities (sensory and motor). TC projections, distinct from the ones arising from specific unimodal sensory nuclei, were observed from motor thalamus to PE/PEa or auditory cortex and from sensory thalamus to PMd/PMv. The central lateral nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus project to all injected areas, but the most significant overlap across modalities was found in the medial pulvinar nucleus. The present results demonstrate the presence of thalamic territories integrating different sensory modalities with motor attributes. Based on the divergent/convergent pattern of TC and corticothalamic projections, 4 distinct mechanisms of multisensory and sensorimotor interplay are proposed.","auditory system, corticothalamic, monkey, motor system, somatosensory system, tracing",

In a first series of experiments, the lectin wheat germ-agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into all major sensory, motor, intralaminar, and reticular (RE) thalamic nuclei of cats and into the mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar-lateroposterior thalamic nuclei of macaque monkeys. In cats numerous neurons of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band nucleus and the substantia innominata (SI), including its rostromedial portion termed the ventral pallidum (VP), were retrogradely labeled after WGA-HRP injections in the rostral pole of the RE complex, the MD, and anteroventral/anteromedial (AV/AM) thalamic nuclei. Fewer retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the same areas after injections in the ventromedial (VM) thalamic nucleus, and none or very few after other thalamic injections. After RE, MD, and AV/AM injections, 7–20% of all retrogradely labeled cells in the basal forebrain were also ChAT positive, while none of the retrogradely labeled neurons following VM injections displayed ChAT immunoreactivity. The basal forebrain projection to the MD nucleus was shown to arise principally from VP in both cats and macaque monkeys. In a second series of experiments performed in cats, injections of WGA-HRP in the brainstem peribrachial (PB) area comprising the pedunculopontine nucleus led to retrograde labeling of a moderate number of neurons in the lateral part of the VP, SI, and preoptic area (POA), only a few of which displayed ChAT immunoreactivity. In addition, a large number of retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the bed nuclei of the anterior commissure and stria terminalis after PB injections. In a third series of experiments, the use of the retrograde double-labeling method with fluorescent tracers in squirrel monkeys allowed us to identify a significant number of basal forebrain neurons sending axon collaterals to both the RE thalamic nucleus and PB brainstem area, while no double-labeled neurons were disclosed after injections confined to the ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei and PB area or following injections in the cerebral cortex and PB area. Our findings reveal the existence of cholinergic and noncholinergic basal forebrain projections to the thalamus and the brainstem in both cats and macaque monkeys. We suggest that these projections may play a crucial role in the control of thalamic functions in mammals.",,

A fragment, from the transmembrane segments MIII to MIV of Macaca neuronal nAChR subunits was cloned, and shown to exhibit high identity (around 95%) to the corresponding human subunits. Then, specific oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized for in situ hybridization experiments. Both α4 and β2 mRNA signals were widely distributed in the brain, being stronger in the thalamus and in the dopaminergic cells of the mesencephalon. Most brain nuclei displayed both α4 and β2 signals with the exception of some basal ganglia regions and the reticular thalamic nucleus which were devoid of α4 signal. α6 and β3 mRNA signals were selectively concentrated in the substantia nigra and the medial habenula. The strongest signals for α3 or β4 mRNAs were found in the epithalamus (medial habenula and pineal gland), whereas there were no specific α3 or β4 signals in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. α5 and α7 mRNA signals were found in several brain areas, including cerebral cortex, thalamus and substantia nigra, although at a lower level than α4 and β2. The distribution of α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, β2, β3 and β4 subunit mRNAs in the monkey is substantially similar to that observed in rodent brain. Surprisingly, α2 mRNA signal was largely distributed in the Macaca brain, at levels comparable with those of α4 and β2. This observation represents the main difference between rodent and Macaca subunit mRNA distribution and suggests that, besides α4β2*, α2β2* nAChRs constitute a main nAChR isoform in primate brain.",,

Retrograde transport demonstrated that the two premotor areas and the motor cortex each receive thalamic input from separate, cytoarchitectonically well defined subdivisions of the ventrolateral thalamus. According to the nomenclature of Olszewski (Olszewski, J. (1952) The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. An Atlas for Use with the Stereotaxic Instrument, S. Karger, AG, Basel), input to the APA originates largely from area X, input to the SMA originates largely from the pars oralis subdivision of nucleus ventralis lateralis (VLo), and that to the motor cortex originates largely from the pars oralis subdivision of nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis (VPLo). These observations, when combined with prior studies on the termination of various subcortical efferents in the thalamus, lead to the following scheme of connections: (1) rostral portions of the deep cerebellar nuclei project to the motor cortex via VPLo; (2) caudal portions of the deep cerebellar nuclei project to the APA via area X; and (3) the globus pallidus projects to the SMA via VLo. Thus, each thalamocortical pathway is associated with a distinct subcortical input.",,

We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of V1 cortex between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque primary visual cortex rather than convergent evolution of these features.

That each of these cortical areas has a unique thalamic input was illustrated in the preceding paper. In the present experiments the cortical afferent projections to these 3 areas of the sensorimotor cortex monkey were visualized and compared, using 4 differentiable fluorescent dyes as axonal retrogradely transported labels. The cortical projection patterns to areas 3a, 3b, and 4 were similar in that they each consisted of (a) a “halo” of input from the immediately surrounding cortex, and (b) discrete projections from one or more remote cortical areas. However, the pattern of remote inputs from precentral, mesial, and posterior parietal cortex was different for each of the 3 cortical target areas. The cortical input configuration was least complex for area 3b, its remote input projecting mainly from insular cortex. The pattern of discrete cortical inputs to the motor area 4, however, was more complex, with projections from the cingulate motor area (24c/d), the supplementary motor area, postarcuate cortex, insular cortex, and postcentral areas 2/5. Area 3a, in addition to the proximal projections from the immediately surrounding cortex, also received input from the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, insular cortex, and areas 2/5. Thus, this pattern of cortical input to area 3a resembled more closely that of the adjacent motor rather than that of the somatosensory area 3b. Contrasting with this, however, the thalamic input to area 3a was largely from somatosensory VPLc (abbreviations from Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. Basel: Karger) and not from VPLo (with input from cerebellum, and projecting to precentral motor areas). © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The placement of injections of anatomical tracers (horseradish peroxidase, wheat germ agglutinin, or 3H-proline) was guided by extensive microelectrode maps of cortex in the region of the injection site. These maps identified the body parts represented in the cortex included in the injection site, and provided information about the physiological boundaries of area 2, which was related later to the cortical architecture. Most injections were placed in the representation of the hand in area 2, which was highly responsive to cutaneous stimuli and could be mapped in detail. Injections were also placed in other parts of area 2, area 1, or area 5, and some injections involved more than one area. As other investigators have determined, regions of retrograde and anterograde thalamic label overlapped, demonstrating that connections with cortex are reciprocal. Injections completely confined to area 2 consistently produced label in two locations: the anterior pulvinar (Pa) and a dorsal capping zone of the ventroposterior complex that we term the ventroposterior superior nucleus (VPS). Single restricted injection sites resulted in one region of label in VPS, and multiple foci of label in Pa. In some cases where the injection was confined to the representation of the hand in area 2, label was also found more ventrally in the ventroposterior complex in ventroposterior nucleus proper (VP). Thus, area 2 receives input from Pa, VPS, and, at least in some locations and individuals, VP. Injections of tracers into area 1 confirmed previous findings that area 1 is densely interconnected with VP. In addition, there appear to be sparse connections with VPS. There was no evidence of connections with Pa. Evidence from injection sites that extended from area 2 into areas 5 and 7, and from injection sites in area 5, indicates that the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) projects to rostral areas 5 and 7. The results support the conclusion that area 2 is a functionally distinct subdivision of somatosensory cortex, and indicate that area 2 has thalamic connections that are characteristic of both “sensory” (VP and VPS) and “association” (Pa) cortical fields.",,

Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex1–4. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending monkeys, that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), at the same time it decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Francis Crick5, argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that “if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway”, a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.",,

Single or paired injections of anterogradely transported tracers, of varying anteroposterior extent, were made horizontally from behind in defined parts of the body representation in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and/or ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamic nuclei, and the distribution and density of labeled thalamocortical terminations were mapped in cortex. Injections of increasing size in any dimension of VPL or VPM resulted in increasing accumulation of labeled terminals within the region of projection, implying extensive convergence of individual axons. Anteroposteriorly elongated injections labeled mediolaterally extended but anteroposteriorly restricted zones in cortex. Dorsoventral placement of an injection in VPL or VPM determined anteroposterior location of labeling in cortex. Dual injections separated mediolaterally or dorsoventrally by ∼1 mm, and in different parts of the thalamic body or head–face representation gave rise to labeled thalamocortical terminations that overlapped extensively. For injection sites at different anteroposterior levels in VPL or VPM, the area of cortical convergence was related to their extent of anteroposterior coincidence. Labeled terminations arising from injections in immediately adjacent parts of VPL and VPM did not overlap in cortex. The extent of thalamocortical divergence and convergence revealed by these experiments is greater than that predictable from labeling of single axons and is sufficiently great to account for representational plasticity that exceeds the 1.5 mm cortical “distance limit.”","ventral posterior nucleus, area 3b, cortical plasticity, somatotopic representation, Phaseolus vulgaris,leukoagglutinin, fluorescent dextrans",

Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors.","laminar origin of projections, presynaptic specificity, macaque brain, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inhibitory control, 3D reconstruction",

The results indicate that both areas TE and TEO receive nonreciprocal inputs from several thalarnic nuclei, including paracentralis, ventralis anterior, centralis, and limitans, and that TE also receives input from reuniens. Additional nonreciprocal inputs to both areas arise from the hypothalamus, basal nucleus of Meynert, dorsal and median raphe, loeus coeruleus, and reticular formation. TE and TEO are reciprocally connected with the lateral, medial, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar and with the ventral portion of the claustrum.

TE also sends a vcry limited projection to nucleus medialis dorsalis magnocellularis of the thalamus. AK-huugh the connections of areas TE and TEO are overlapping in most subcortical structures, they are partially segregated in the pulvinar, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the striatum.

First, direct thalamic input can determine the size of the initial activating RF at high contrast. Second, lateral connections can enlarge the RF at low contrast by pooling information from larger regions at cortex that are otherwise ineffective when high contrast thalamic input is driving the cortical neuron. Thirdly, feedback from extrastriate cortex (possibly together with overlap or interdigitation of coactive lateral connectional fields within V1) can provide a large and stimulus specific surround modulatory field. The stimulus specificity of the interactions between the center and surround fields, may be due to the orderly, matching structure and different scales of intra-areal and feedback projection excitatory pathways. The observed activity changes of single recorded excitatory neurons could be a result of the relative weight of excitation on the excitatory neurons themselves and on local inhibitory interneurons that synapse on them. Inhibitory basket neurons, driven by the local excitatory neurons, could govern local interactions between cortical patches of different tuning properties, resulting in more distant changes in excitatory input in the laterally connected intra-areal neuronal pools.",,

All of the proprioceptive and tactile information specifying hand and finger sensorimotor action, along with that from the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and brainstem, which helps to shape this action, is transmitted to the sensorimotor cortex through the thalamus. The organization of thalamocortical neuron populations mediating this transfer is important, and one analytic approach is to examine how these populations can be functionally compartmentalized on the basis of their extrinsic connections. From the approach, it is found that every part of the sensorimotor cortex receives a complex, convergent, and unique thalamic input.

In Old World monkeys, rostral and caudal aspects of the hand representation are located in the precentral gyrus and the anterior bank of the central sulcus, respectively. We previously reported the organization of the cortico-cortical connections of the grasp zone in rostral M1. Here we describe the organization of thalamocortical connections that were labeled from the same tracer injections. Thalamocortical connections of a grasp zone in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the M1 orofacial representation are included for direct comparison. The M1 grasp zone was primarily connected with ventral lateral divisions of motor thalamus. The largest proportion of inputs originated in the posterior division (VLp) followed by the medial and the anterior divisions. Thalamic inputs to the M1 grasp zone originated in more lateral aspects of VLp as compared to the origins of thalamic inputs to the M1 orofacial representation. Inputs to M1 from thalamic divisions connected with cerebellum constituted three fold the density of inputs from divisions connected with basal ganglia, whereas the ratio of inputs was more balanced for the grasp zone in PMv. Privileged access of the cerebellothalamic pathway to the grasp zone in rostral M1 is consistent with the connection patterns previously reported for the precentral gyrus. Thus, cerebellar nuclei are likely more involved than basal ganglia nuclei with the contributions of rostral M1 to manual dexterity.","Intracortical electrical stimulation, Motor cortex, Ventral premotor cortex, Thalamocortical, Cerebellum, Basal ganglia",

Six normalMacaca cynomolgus and 7 having received spinal sections, were studied. Ventricular radiography was performed and all the coordinates were related to new stereotaxic coordinates using the posterior commissure as the origin. Cell-bodies and axon units were recognized on the basis of the shape of the spikes. In normal animals, 972 units were studied; 307 were thalamic units with peripheral fields and 177 were derived from cell bodies. Localization of these cells was studied as a function of their peripheral field and response characteristics. The majority of ventralis posterior (VP) cell bodies were only activated by contralateral stimulation, their peripheral field being frequently found on the extremities. Somatotopic organization consisted of concentric layers rather than zones in apposition. Dorsoventral segregation of afferent modality sensitivity (movement, pressure, light touch) was observed. Somatosensory convergence was found in VP inferior (VPi) as well as convergence of different types of afferents on a few VP cells. Units responding to bilateral or ipsilateral stimulations were found only in posterior VP and in surrounding nuclei. A particular somatotopy was shown to exist in n. reticularis. A total of 838 units were studied in animals having had dorsal columns and Morin's bundle severed. Only a few cells (13) responded in VP1 to contralateral hindlimb stimulation. Their characteristics recall those noted in layer V spinal cord cells. The other cells (55) still driven by a hindlimb were dispersed in the nuclei just adjacent to VP1. The majority of cells found in the VP1 were activated from the forelimb. They were observed in their normal VP1 localization as well as in areas where hindlimb representation was found in normal animals. This change of afferent input is attributed to a reinnervaration of hindlimb cells (probably at the gracilis level) by sprouting from forelimb afferent.",,

There is no agreement, however, on its cytoarchitectonic organization. The aim of this study was to redefine the cytoarchitectonic organization of superior and mesial area 6 and the adjacent cingulate cortex in the macaque monkey. A particular goal was to find out whether the so-called supplementary motor area (SMA) is cytoarchitectonically different from the rest of area 6 and whether it can be considered as a single, independent cytoarchitectonic area. The results showed that, rostral to F1 (area 4), four architectonic areas can be recognized in the superior (dorsal) and mesial area 6. Two of them are located on mesial cortical surface (F3 caudally and F6 rostrally) and two on superior cortical convexity (F2 caudally and F7 rostrally). The main cytoarchitectonic features of the five identified areas can be summarized as follows. F1: (1) giant pyramidal cells organized in multiple rows. (2) columnar pattern extending from the white matter to the superficial layers, (3) low cellular density in the lower part of layer III. F3: (1) high cellular density in the lower part of layer III, which fuses with a dense Va, (2) columnar pattern present only in the deepest layer, (3) occasional presence of giant pyramidal cells in layer Vb. F6: (1) prominent layer V, (2) absence of sublayer Vb, (3) homogeneous cell density in superficial layers. F2: (1) thin row of medium-size pyramids in the lowest part of layer III, (2) columnar pattern extending to the superficial layers, (3) dense layer Va, (4) few, scattered giant pyramids in layer Vb. F7: (1) prominent layer V, (2) bipartite layer VI. Areas F1, F2, and F3, as defined cytoarchitectonically, coincided with the homonymous histochemical areas. The present data showed also that area 24 is formed by four subareas: 24a, b, c and d. Areas 24a ana b occupy the ventral part of area 24, whereas its dorsal part is formed by area 24c, located rostrally, and area 24d, located caudally. The following features distinguish area 24d from area 24c: (1) larger pyramidal cells in layer V, (2) presence of medium-size pyramidal cells in the lower part of layer III, (3) more prominent columnar pattern, (4) higher myelinization with the presence of an evident horizontal plexus. Mesial area 6 is usually considered as a single functional entity (SMA). Our findings show that this cortical region is formed by two distinct cytoarchitectonic areas. In the following article (Luppino et al. 1991: J. Comp. Neurol 311:463–482) physiological evidence is presented that the SMA, as classically defined, corresponds to F3, whereas F6 is an independent functional area.",,

We cannot use the hand in this way unless the brain receives a continuous inflow of proprioceptive and tactile sensory information, mostly generated by the movement itself, which specifies the position of the hand in space, and the contact it makes with the object. Nor can the sensory information needed to identify the form and surface features of this object be collected efficiently without using the appropriate exploratory movements of the fingers. It has been known for a century that this intelligent, adaptive manual action depends on the integrity of a large wedge of neocortex surrounding the central sulcus of the primate hemisphere, directed movements being determined by precentral cortex, and touch and proprioception requiring minimally an intact postcentral cortex. However, it is still not clear whether the integration of sensory and motor information that underlies the execution of a dextrous manual task, begins first in the sensorimotor cortex, or earlier, in the thalamus. The pattern of thalamocortical projections to the sensorimotor cortex should provide clues to this problem.",,

To this end, we derive a unique network incorporating 410 anatomical tracing studies of the macaque brain from the Collation of Connectivity data on the Macaque brain (CoCoMac) neuroinformatic database. Our network consists of 383 hierarchically organized regions spanning cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia; models the presence of 6,602 directed long-distance connections; is three times larger than any previously derived brain network; and contains subnetworks corresponding to classic corticocortical, corticosubcortical, and subcortico-subcortical fiber systems. We found that the empirical degree distribution of the network is consistent with the hypothesis of the maximum entropy exponential distribution and discovered two remarkable bridges between the brain's structure and function via network-theoretical analysis. First, prefrontal cortex contains a disproportionate share of topologically central regions. Second, there exists a tightly integrated core circuit, spanning parts of premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, insula, and visual cortex, that includes much of the task-positive and task-negative networks and might play a special role in higher cognition and consciousness.","neuroanatomy, brain network, network analysis, structural, functional",

The midline and intralaminar nuclear complex taken as a whole projects to widespread, predominantly frontal, cortical areas. Each of the constituent thalamic nuclei has a restricted cortical projection field that overlaps only slightly with the projection fields of adjacent midline and intralaminar nuclei. The projections of the intralaminar nuclei cover a larger cortical area than those of the midline nuclei. The laminar distributions of fibres from individual midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are different and include both deep and superficial cortical layers. The parataenial, paraventricular and intermediodorsal midline nuclei each project to circumscribed parts of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. In the prefrontal cortex, the projections are restricted to the medial orbital, infralimbic, ventral prelimbic and agranular insular fields, and the rostral part of the ventral anterior cingular cortex. In contrast to the other midline nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus projects to widespread cortical areas. The rostral intralaminar nuclei innervate dorsal parts of the prefrontal cortex, i.e. the dorsal parts of the prelimbic, anterior cingular and dorsal agranular insular cortical fields, the lateral and ventrolateral orbital areas, and the caudal part of the ventral anterior cingular cortex. Additional projections are aimed at the agranular fields of the motor cortex and the caudal part of the parietal cortex. The lateral part of the parafascicular nucleus sends fibres predominantly to the lateral agranular field of the motor cortex and the rostral part of the parietal cortex. The medial part of the parafascicular nucleus projects rather sparsely to the dorsal part of the prelimbic cortex, the anterior cingular cortex and the medial agranular field of the motor cortex. Individual midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are thus in a position to directly influence circumscribed areas of the cerebral cortex. In combination with previously reported data on the organization of the midline and intralaminar thalamostriatal projections and the prefrontal corticostriatal projections the present results suggest a high degree of differentiation in the convergence of thalamic and cortical afferent fibres in the striatum. Each of the recently described parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits can thus be expanded to include projections at both the cortical and striatal levels from a specific part of the midline and intralaminar nuclear complex. The distinctive laminar distributions of the fibres originating from the different nuclei emphasize the specificity of the midline and intralaminar thalamocortical projections.",CA1; field CA1 of Ammon's horn; PHA-L; Phaseolus vulgaris -leucoagglutinin;,

Some projections from these midbrain regions to the inferior pulvinar are also described as are projections to the thalamus from the tectorccipient parabigeminal nucleus. First, the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient pretectal nuclei and SC layers were determined by Nissl stains, myelin stains, and the distribution of label resulting from intraocular injections of tritiated amino acids. The possible projections of these pre-tectal nuclei, layers of the SC (as well as the parabigeminal nucleus), to the pulvinar and DLG were then determined by both horseradish peroxidase and autoradiographic tracing methods. The retinal projections to the SC extend throughout layers II-l, II-2, II-3, and dorsal III with obvious patches in layers II-l and II-2 as described before by others. There were a number of pretectal nuclei which also had connections with the retina. In the nomenclature adopted, these include the sublentiform nucleus, the nucleus of the optic tract (not to be confused with the thalamic limitansnucleus), the posterior (orprincipal) pretectalnucleus, and the laminatedolivary nucleus (with a head and tail). The nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of the pretectal area do not receive retinal projections. The retinorecipient midbrain regions which project to the pulvinar are as follows. Aside from a complicated multifocal projection to the inferior pulvinar, the superficial retinorecipient SC layers project to three terminal foci or zones in one or more of the lateral pulvinar subdivisions alpha, beta, and gamma (Rezak and Benevento, 1977). Focus 1 lies mainly along the dorso-ventral lateral border of subdivisions of PL-gamma and PL-beta, extending ventrally to PL-alpha, and arises from SC layers II-3 and III. Focus 2 occu-pies the lateral 20–50% of PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II-2, II-3, and III. There is a topographical arrangement to the SC projections to foci 1 and 2 which may reflect a representation of more than two visual quadrants in the lateral pulvinar. Focus 3, which consists of several clusters, is located medially in PL-gamma and PL-beta and overlaps their mutual border with the medial pul-vinar. Focus 3 is complicated as it is made up of a mixed input from the retinorecipient (superficial) and nonretinorecipient (deep) SC layers. The portion of focus 3 located along the medial edge of the lateral pulvinar arises mainly from SC layers II-2, II-3, and III, while the portion of the focus located along the adjacent lateral edge of the medial pulvinar arises mainly from SC layersIV, V, and VI. These projections to the pulvinar from the superficial SC differ in their origins from those to the DLG which arise mainly from smaller cells in SC sublayer II-1. The nonretinorecipient SC projections to the pulvinar arise mainly from the deep layers, i.e., IV, V, and VI, and end in focus 4 within the medial pulvinar and the caudal oral pulvinar. The projection from the deep SC layer to the medial half of focus 3 in the medial pulvinar has already been described above. A pretectal projection to the lateral pulvinar from the retinorecipient region consisting of the nucleus of the optic tract, the sublentiform nucleus, and the posterior pretectal nucleus (collectively called SL in our previous study, Benevento et al., 1977b) was confirmed. This projection forms a focus (focus 5) in the dorsal shoulder of the rostral lateral pulvinar, which extends over foci 1 and 3. Our HRP data indicate that these pretectal nuclei might have convergent projections with the SC to foci 1 to 4 and the DLG. How- ever, because of the problem of interruption of fibers of passage, this inter- pretation of convergent projections should be viewed with caution. The HRP studies also indicate that the parabigeminal nucleus, which is inter- connected with the SC, projects to the thalamus, as it contained a modest number of labelled cells after injections of the inferior pulvinar and focus 2 in PL-alpha, but only a sparse number after injections of the DLG and focus 1. These results suggest that direct retinal influences can be relayed to visually responsive association cortex via retino-tectal-lateral pulvinar, retino-pretectal-lateral pulvinar, and retino-tecto-parabigeminal-lateral pulvinar routes in addition to the retino-tectal-geniculate and retino-tectal-inferior pulvinar routes. In addition, visuomotor and polysensory information influences thalamocortical systems via projections from the deep layers of the SC to the medial pulvinar. When these findings are compared with the known organization of pulvinocortical interconnections one can conclude that the cortex of all four neocortical lobes can be influenced rather directly by the midbrain. The response properties of the various cortical visual areas, thus, need not depend solely upon the corticocortical projections.",,

This region is referred to as the posterior nucleus. The cortical projections of each of these nuclei, together with those of the adjacent ventral, pulvinar and medial geniculate complexes, have been studied by means of the autoradiographic tracing technique. The suprageniculate-limitans nucleus, the main input to which is the superior colliculus, projects upon the granular insular area of the cortex. The medial portion of the posterior nucleus projects to the retroinsular field lying posterior to the second somatic sensory area. There is clinical and electrophysiological evidence to suggest that the retroinsular area may form part of a central pain pathway. The lateral portion of the posterior nucleus which is closely related to certain elements of the medial geniculate complex, projects to the postaditory cortical field. The ventroposterioinferior nucleus, which may be involved in vestibular function, projects to the dysgranular insular field. The principal medial geniculate nucleus can be subdivided into a ventral division that projects to field AI of the auditory cortex and a dorsal division that merges with the posterior nucleus; it is further subdivided into an anterodorsal component that projects to two fields on the superior temporal gyrus, together with a posterodorsal component in which separate cell populations project to areas lying anterior and medial to AI. The magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus, sometimes considered a part of the posterior complex, appears to project diffusely to layer I of all the auditory fields. The Auditory fields are bounded on three sides by the projection field of the medial nucleus of the pulvinar which also extends into the upper end of the lateral sulcus to bound the fields receiving fibers from the posterior nucleus. The topography of the areas receiving fibers from the posterior, medial geniculate and pulvinar complexes, taken in conjunction with the rotation of the primate temporal lobe, permits all of these fields to be compared with similar, better known areas in the cat brain.",,

We provide novel evidence for neurochemical and synaptic specificity of two complementary circuits linking one such system, the prefrontal cortex with the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus in primates. One circuit originated from the neurochemical group of parvalbumin-positive thalamic neurons and projected focally through large terminals to the middle cortical layers, resembling ‘drivers’ in sensory pathways. Parvalbumin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by small ‘modulatory’ type cortical terminals, forming asymmetric (presumed excitatory) synapses at thalamic sites enriched with the specialized metabotropic glutamate receptors. A second circuit had a complementary organization: it originated from the neurochemical group of calbindin-positive thalamic neurons and terminated through small ‘modulatory’ terminals over long distances in the superficial prefrontal layers. Calbindin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by prefrontal axons through small and large terminals that formed asymmetric synapses preferentially at sites with ionotropic glutamate receptors, consistent with a driving pathway. The largely parallel thalamo-cortical pathways terminated among distinct and laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons that differ markedly in inhibitory control. The balance of activation of these parallel circuits that link a high-order association cortex with the thalamus may allow shifts to different states of consciousness, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.",,

I. The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop,"This paper reviews some of the recent findings on different aspects of the anatomical organization of the basal ganglia. Attempts have been made to delineate the anatomical substrate of information processing along the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. Emphasis has been placed on data obtained with highly sensitive anterograde tract-tracing methods applied to the study of the main axis of the loop, which is composed of the striatum, the pallidum, and the substantia nigra. These findings have highlighted the complexities of the organization of the intrinsic basal ganglia circuitry, which comprises multiple modular units that are distributed according to highly ordered and repetitive patterns. Such an arrangement is well suited to convey cortical information in a highly specific manner throughout the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia circuitry is also designed so as to modulate in a precise manner the neuronal activity of several brain functional systems, which are involved in the direct control of different aspects of psychomotor behavior. Of utmost importance is the action of the basal ganglia on thalamocortical premotor neurons. It is through these neurons, which can be considered as a sort of final common pathway, that the basal ganglia ultimately influence the complex neuronal computation that goes on at cortical level.",Basal ganglia; Striatum; Globus pallidus; Thalamus; Substantia nigra; Pedunculopontíne nucleus; Striatopallidal connection; Striatonigral connection; Pallidothalamic connection;,

It explains the study based on 14 injections of WGA-HRP and injections of fluorescent dyes in the agranular frontal cortex of macaque monkeys. Most of the injections are made in electrophysiologically identified cortical sites. This allows one to correlate the thalamocortical projections to the cytoarchitectonic cortical subdivision.

Our data demonstrated that: 1) GABAergic local circuit neurons were detected in the thalamic visual domain in all the species analyzed, whereas in other thalamic nuclei their presence and number varied among species; 2) the number of GABAergic local circuit neurons progressively increased in the dorsal thalamus of species with more complex behavior; 3) the presence of local circuit neurons conferred a similar intrinsic organization to the dorsal thalamic nuclei, characterized by complex synaptic arrangements; 4) in the reticular thalamic nucleus, whose neurons were GABA-immunoreactive in all the examined species, the cellular density decreased from the bat to humans. These findings strongly suggest that thalamic GABAergic local circuit neurons are not directly related to the ability to perform specific sensorimotor tasks, but they are likely to reflect an increasing complexity of the local information processing that occurs at thalamic level.

In conjunction with this, the intracortical distribution of the thalamo-cortical fibers has been studied by the autoradiographic tracing technique. There is a systematic change in the density, laminar distribution and general character of the intracortical thalamic afferent plexus which seems to follow, in particular, the progressive differentiation of cortical layering that occurs in moving from insular through granular to homotypical cortex. In the dysgranular and granular insular areas in which cortical lamination is indistinct, the thalamic plexus as demonstrated autoradiographically is sparse and extends through much of layers III and IV. In the granular cortex (areas 3b and AI), the thalamic plexus is densest and coarsest; it fills all of layers IV and IIIB and extends into layer IIIA. In the “second” and “third” sensory areas, such as the second somatic sensory and many of the auditory fields, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals. In the homotypical cortex, the plexus becomes sparser, finer and strictly confined to layer IIIB. In many areas there are additional indications of thalamic terminations in deeper layers. Where layers V and VI are not divided into sublaminae (e.g., in areas 3b and AI) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI. Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical cortex, the labeling is confined to layer VB. Terminations in layer I of the cortex of the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body was involved by the injection of isotope. The boundaries of the cortical projection fields of individual thalamic nuclei, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change. Zones of apparent architectonic transition never showed overlap of thalamic afferents emanating from more than one nucleus. These results raise for discussion the significance of architectonic structure in relation to cortical connectivity and have a bearing upon those studies that have attempted to relate the terminals of thalamic afferents to particular classes of cortical neuron.",,

In the present study, examination of the posteroventral retrosplenial region of the rhesus monkey in sections that were orthogonal to its axis of curvature (and therefore appropriate for architectonic analysis) has permitted definition of its architecture and precise extent. This analysis demonstrated that areas 29 and 30 of the retrosplenial cortex, as well as adjacent area 23 of the posterior cingulate cortex, extend together as an arch around the splenium of the corpus callosum and maintain their topographical relationship with one another throughout their entire course. Injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers confined to retrosplenial area 30 revealed that this area has reciprocal connections with adjacent areas 23, 19 and PGm, with the mid-dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex (areas 9, 9/46 and 46), with multimodal area TPO in the superior temporal sulcus, as well as the posterior parahippocampal cortex, the presubiculum and the entorhinal cortex. There are also bidirectional connections with the lateroposterior thalamic nucleus, as well as the laterodorsal and the anteroventral limbic thalamic nuclei. The connectivity of area 30 suggests that it may play a role in working memory processes subserved by the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex in interaction with the hippocampal system.",,

There were 3 main findings. 1) We confirmed previously reported significant ventral–dorsal stream latency lags at the level of V4 (V4 mean = 38.7 ms vs. middle temporal mean = 26.9 ms) and inferotemporal cortex (IT mean = 43.4 ms vs. dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus mean = 33.9 ms). 2) We found that wavelength-sensitive inputs in areas V1, V4, and IT lagged the wavelength-insensitive responses by significant margins; this lag increased over successive levels of the system. 3) We found that laminar activation profiles in V4 and IT were inconsistent with “feedforward” input through the ascending ventral cortical pathway; the likely alternative input routes include both lateral inputs from the dorsal stream and direct inputs from nonspecific thalamic neurons. These findings support a “Framing” Model of ventral stream visual processing in which rapidly conducted inputs, mediated by one or more accessory pathways, modulate the processing of more slowly conducted feedforward inputs.",current source density; dorsal stream; response latency; timing; ventral stream; wavelength sensitivity;,

Reciprocal corticocortical connections were observed primarily with the supplementary motor area (SMA) in medial premotor area 6 and dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus, postarcuate area 6 cortex, dorsal cingulate cortex (area 24), superior parietal lobule (area 5, PE/PEa), and inferior parietal lobule (area 7b, PF/PFop, including the secondary somatosensory SII region). In these heavily labeled regions, the associationl intrahemispheric afferents originated primarily from small and medium sized pyramidal cells in layer III, but also from layer V. The SMA projections were columnar in organization. Intrahemispheric afferents from contralateral homologous and nonhomologous frontal and cingulate cortices also originated predominatly from layer III, but the connections from contralateral area 4 were almost exclusively from layer III. The bilateral connections with premotor frontal area 6 and cingulate cortices were not observed with parietal regions; i.e., only ipsilateral intrahemispheric parietal corticocortical connections were observed. There were no significant connections with prearcuate area 8 or the granular frontal (prefrontal) cortex. Subcortical afferents originated primarily from the nucleus basalis of Meynert, dorsal claustrum, ventral lateral (VLo and VLc), area X, ventral posterolateral pars oralis (VPLo), central lateral and centromedian thalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, locus ceruleus and subceruleus, and superior central and dorsal raphe nuclei. Lesser numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the nucleus of the diagonal band, mediodorsal (MD), paracentral, and central superior lateral thalamic nuclei, nucleus limitans, nucleus annularis, and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation.

There was a bilateral projection to the lateral reticular nucleus and to a lesser extent to the inferior olivary nucleus, and the possibility of light projections to the cuneate and medial vestibular nuclei and to the nucleus intercalatus above the hypoglossal nucleus. Projections to the cervical spinal cord terminated primarily in contralateral laminae VII and IX and to a lesser extent to the ipsilateral medial ventral horn.

This is reflected by the influence of thalamic stimulation on cortical activity and behavior as well as apparently cortical lesion syndromes occurring as a function of small thalamic insults. Here, we attempt to noninvasively test the correspondence of structural and functional connectivity of the human thalamus using diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI. Using a large sample of 102 adults, we apply tensor independent component analysis to diffusion MRI tractography data to blindly parcellate bilateral thalamus according to diffusion tractography-defined structural connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI collected in the same subjects, we show that the resulting structurally defined thalamic regions map to spatially distinct, and anatomically predictable, whole-brain functional networks in the same subjects. Although there was significant variability in the functional connectivity patterns, the resulting 51 structural and functional patterns could broadly be reduced to a subset of 7 similar core network types. These networks were distinct from typical cortical resting-state networks. Importantly, these networks were distributed across the brain and, in a subset, map extremely well to known thalamocortico-basal-ganglial loops.","functional connectivity, functional networks, resting-state fMRI, thalamus, tractography",

The ventral striatum contained a higher density of cholinergic cell bodies than the dorsal striatum. All of the structures that contained the choline acetyltransferase positive neurons also had acetylcholinesterase-rich neurons. Choline acetyltransferase positive neurons were not encountered in the cortex. Some perikarya in the midline, intralaminar, reticular and limbic thalamic nuclei as well as in the hypothalamus were rich in acetylcholinesterase but did not give a positive choline acetyltransferase reaction.

For this purpose injections of horseradish peroxidase, or horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin were placed in different parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. These experiments revealed the organization of the reciprocal mediodorsal-prefrontal connections since wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase is transported effectively in anterograde and retrograde directions. Injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tracers were placed in different portions of the prefrontal cortex and the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was injected in the mediodorsal nucleus in order to verify in more detail the point-to-point relationship in the mediodorsal-prefrontal connections. The organization of a number of the subcortical afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus was determined in detail using injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase, or tritiated amino acids in areas identified as a source of mediodorsal afferents in the retrograde tracing experiments. These anterograde tracers were injected in different parts of the pallidal complex, the amygdala, the lateral hypothalamus, the lateral entorhinal cortex, the ventral mesencephalon, the superior colliculus and the dorsal tegmental region. The results of the present experiments indicate that the mediodorsal nucleus, on the basis of its cyto-myelo- and chemoarchitecture as well as the organization of its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex, can be subdivided into a medial, a central, a lateral and a paralamellar segment. Apart from this subdivision along a mediolateral axis, rostrocaudal and dorsoventral differences are also evident in the structural organization and connectivity of the mediodorsal nucleus. A number of subcortical structures send fibres to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. The reticular thalamic nucleus projects to the mediodorsal nucleus in a topographical way such that its rostral part is connected with the rostral part of the nucleus, whereas more caudal and ventral areas in the reticular thalamic nucleus are connected with more caudal parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. Regions in the brainstem that project to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus include the mesencephalic raphénuclei, the locus coeruleus, the rostral part of the central gray substance and the reticular formation. The median raphénucleus projects most heavily to lateral parts of the mediodorsal nucleus, whereas the dorsal raphénucleus is most strongly connected with its medial parts. Besides these general inputs, the different mediodorsal nuclear segments receive a specific input and have different relations with particular areas of the prefrontal cortex. The rostral part of the medial segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the prelimbic and the ventral anterior cingulate areas, and to a lesser degree with the medial orbital and the ventral agranular insular areas. The posterior, ventral part of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus has reciprocal fibre relations with the dorsal agranular insular area. The most medial part of the nucleus, immediately adjacent to the paraventricular nucleus, receives fibres from the infralimbic area, but appears not to reciprocate them. The medial segment receives input from a large number of structures in the realm of the limbic system, i.e. the amygdala, the lateral entorhinal cortex, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the lateral preoptic area, the supramammillary nuclei and from structures that are closely related to the basal ganglia system, i.e. the ventral pallidum, the ventral tegmental area and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. With an antibody against dopamine, it was determined that both the paraventricular nucleus and the adjacent parts of the mediodorsal nucleus contain a plexus of dopaminergic fibres. The most medial zone of the dorsal-medial thalamus, which includes the paraventricular nucleus, receives additional fibres from the nucleus accumbens, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the dorsomedial hypothalamus, the subiculum, the parabrachial nuclei and the nucleus of the solitary tract. The central segment of the mediodorsal nucleus differs from the medial segment in that it receives its most strong and specific input from olfactory related structures, such as the deep layers of the prepiriform cortex and the ventral pallidal cells in the olfactory tubercle. The central segment also receives afferents from the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the lateral preoptic area and the lateral hypothalamus. This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the ventral agranular insular and the lateral orbital areas. The lateral segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives a small number of fibres from the medial portion of the globus pallidus and the lateral hypothalamus, but its main inputs come from brainstem structures such as the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus. This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the dorsal anterior cingulate area. The paralamellar segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives afferents from the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus. Additional inputs most probably come from pretectal nuclei, the region of the cuneiform nucleus and the contralateral fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum. This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the medial precentral area of the frontal cortex, an area that in the rat constitutes the frontal eye field. These results indicate that in the rat, via distinct segments of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, different parts of the prefrontal cortex can be influenced by a wide spectrum of structures that are mainly involved in the limbic circuitry, or are part of the limbic-afferented basal ganglia. An important observation is that the mediodorsal nucleus receives strong inputs from pallidal, nigral and tectal areas, which are the main waystations in the outflow of the basal ganglia. This may imply a role for the mediodorsal nucleus in the anticipatory and corollary mechanisms that have been alluded to the prefrontal cortex.",ACHE; acetylcholinesterase; ChAT; choline acetyltransferase; DAB; diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride; DY; Diamidino Yellow; FB; Fast Blue; FITC; fluorescein isothiocyanate; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; MD; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; PAP; peroxidase-antiperoxidase; PHA-L; Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; TMB; tetramethyl benzidine; TBS-T; Triton X-100; WGA-HRP; wheatgerm agglutinin-HRP;,

The dentate and interpositus anterior (IA) nuclei project topographically onto the two somatotopically organized divisions of the red nucleus and the ventrolateral-ventral intermediate nuclei of the thalamus (VL-Vim). Caudal parts of the dentate project to face areas in medial parts of the parvocellular red nucleus (RNpc) and VL-Vim, rostrolateral parts to central arm areas in these nuclei. There is a small projection from the rostroventral dentate to lateral hindlimb areas in RNpc and VL. Dorsal parts of the dentate project to ventral parts of RNpc and VLc-Vim (distal limb musculature area) exclusively, whereas ventral parts of the dentate project to dorsal parts of RNpc with some overlap ventrally dorsomedial VLc (proximal limb musculature and premotor areas). Caudal parts of IA project to medial forelimb and rostral parts to lateral hindlimb areas in the magnocellular red nucleus (RNmc) and VL-Vim. Projections from IA are greatest to distal musculature areas in VL-Vim.

The sites for injection in the sulcus were determined by using intracortical stimulation to map the location of hand representation. We found that the precentral gyrus and central sulcus receive their predominant input from different subdivisions of the ventrolateral thalamus. Ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation on the gyrus. In contrast, Ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation in the sulcus. Prior studies have shown that VPLo is a major site of termination of cerebellar efferents and that VLo is a major site of termination of pallidal efferents.

Histochemical analysis in fetuses, neonates, and adults of both primate species revealed that MD passes through three major stages of cholinesterase (ChE) reactivity. In Stage I (up to about 16 fetal weeks in man; 9 fetal weeks in monkey), ChE staining gradually increases in the MD nucleus and is intense in axons directed toward the frontal lobe through the internal and external capsules. In Stage II (about 16-28 fetal weeks in man; about 9-14 weeks in monkey), ChE staining in MD reaches peak intensity so that reaction product in the neurons and neuropil blackens the entire nucleus in both species. In favorable planes of section, ChE-positive fibers appear to connect MD and the basal forebrain both of which stain intensely. ChE-positive fibers can also be traced from the lateral margins of MD to the subplate zone beneath the developing frontal cortical plate where they continue to accumulate before later invading the cortex with heaviest concentration in presumptive layers 3 and 5. In Stage III (after 28 weeks of gestation to 6 postnatal months in man; from about 14 fetal weeks until 2 postnatal months in monkey), except for scattered positive cells, ChE staining gradually disappears in MD and the formerly dense laminar pattern in the cortex begins to lighten. The dramatic but transient increase in ChE staining in MD during fetal development as well as the sequentially related changes in its projections indicate that this early appearing enzyme may play a role in the development of the frontal lobe by influencing the differentiation of thalamoprefrontal connections.",,

This study analyzed the relationship of fibers arising in lamina I to nuclei in and around the caudal pole of the ventral posterior nuclear complex and especially to a zone of calbindin-dense immunoreactivity (VMpo) identified by some authors as the sole thalamic relay for these fibers. We show that the densest zone of calbindin immunoreactivity is part of a more extensive, calbindin-immunoreactive region that lies well within the medial tip of the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), as delineated by other staining methods, and prove that the use of different anti-calbindin antibodies cannot account for differences in interpretations of the organization of the posterior thalamic region. By combining immunocytochemical staining with anterograde tracing from injections involving lamina I, we demonstrate widespread fiber terminations that are not restricted to the calbindin-rich medial tip of VPM and show that the lamina I arising fibers are not themselves calbindin immunoreactive. This study disproves the existence of VMpo as an independent thalamic pain nucleus or as a specific relay in the ascending pain system.","calbindin, VMpo, spinothalamic, pain, thalamus, trigeminal",

Until recently, however, longitudinal characterization of in vivo thalamus dynamics had not been reported. In this study, we investigated the metabolism in the thalamus to identify the changes that occur following Coriaria lactone (CL)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and to observe whether the epileptiform discharges could present a difference between the left and right thalami. Five rhesus monkeys underwent whole-brain MRI and single-voxel MRS on a Siemens Trio Tim 3-T MR scanner with a 12-channel head coil. Spectra were processed using LCModel. Scans were performed in five animals before SE and at 1, 7, 21 and 42 days after the onset of SE. Statistical analysis of the data obtained demonstrated no significant difference in the bilateral thalamus of healthy macaques. Our MRS data showed symmetrical distributions of N-acetylaspartate in the right and left thalami after SE (p = 0.003). In addition, this longitudinal study demonstrated elevated glutamate/glutamine (p < 0.05) and reduced myo-inositol (p < 0.05) in the bilateral thalamus 1 day after SE, and all metabolites approached their baseline levels by the fifth scan. Our results demonstrate that metabolic changes occur in the thalamus during CL-induced SE in rhesus monkeys. The various metabolic changes may indicate that the left thalamus is more vulnerable to epileptic strike. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,

In this study, the organization of these projections was defined in relation to architectonic areas within the OMPFC. All of the limbic structures were substantially connected with the following posterior and medial orbital areas: the posteromedial, medial, intermediate, and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm, Iam, Iai, and Ial, respectively) and areas 11m, 13a, 13b, 14c, and 14r. In contrast, lateral orbital areas 12o, 12m, and [12] and medial wall areas 24a, b and 32 were primarily connected with the amygdala, the temporal pole, and the cingulate cortex. Data were not obtained on the poateroventral medial wall. Three distinct projections were recognized from the basal amygdaloid nucleus: (1) The dorsal part projected to area 121; (2) the ventromedial part projected to most areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex except for areas Iai, 12o, 13a, and 14c; and (3) the ventrolateral part projected to orbital areas 12o, Iai, 13a, 14c, and to the medial wall areas. The accessory basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei projected most strongly to areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex. The medial, anterior cortical, and central amygdaloid nuclei and the periamygdaloid cortex were connected with the posterior orbital areas. The projection from the hippocampus originated from the rostral subiculum and terminated in the medial orbital areas. The same region was reciprocally connected with the anterornedial nucleus of the thalamus, which received input from the rostral subiculum. The parahippocampal cortical areas (including the temporal polar, entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices) were primarily connected with posterior and medial orbital areas, with some projections to the dorsal parr of the medial wall. The rostral cingulate cortex sent fibers to the medial wall, to the medial orbital areas, and to lateral areas 12o, 12r, and Iai.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig,2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function. Together with the preceding observations of selective STT projections to other thalamic regions, these results provide compelling evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.

To understand the neural relationship of the PMC with the rest of the brain, we injected its component areas with four different anterograde and retrograde tracers in the cynomolgus monkey and found that all PMC areas are interconnected with each other and with the anterior cingulate, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal, the lateral parietal cortices, and area TPO, as well as the thalamus, where projections from some of the PMC areas traverse in an uninterrupted bar-like manner, the dorsum of this structure from the posteriormost nuclei to its rostralmost tip. All PMC regions also receive projections from the claustrum and the basal forebrain and project to the caudate, the basis pontis, and the zona incerta. Moreover, the posterior cingulate areas are interconnected with the parahippocampal regions, whereas the medial parietal cortex projects only sparsely to the presubiculum. Although local interconnections and shared remote connections of all PMC components suggest a functional relationship among them, the distinct connections of each area with different neural structures suggests that distinct functional modules may be operating within the PMC. Our study provides a large-scale map of the PMC connections with the rest of the brain, which may serve as a useful tool for future studies of this cortical region and may contribute to elucidating its intriguing pattern of activity seen in recent functional imaging studies.","consciousness, default mode of brain function, emotion, posterior cingulate, precuneus",

Connections were traced to the posterior thalamus using the Fink-Heimer I or Wiitanen methods. The postcentral gyrus projected strongly to n. ventralis posterior medialis and lateralis, with small projections to n. pulvinaris oralis, n. lateralis posterior, and n. ventralis posterior inferior. At the mesodiencephalic border degeneration was observed in n. geniculatus medialis (pars magnocellularis) and n. suprageniculatus. Parietal operculum projected mainly to n. ventralis posterior lateralis, medialis, and inferior, and to n. pulvinaris oralis and medialis, with lesser connections to n. medialis dorsalis, n. lateralis posterior, n. suprageniculatus, and n. geniculatus medialis (pars magnocellularis and parvocellularis). The superior parietal lobule projected mainly to n. lateralis posterior and n. pulvinaris oralis, with lesser connections to n. ventralis lateralis, n. suprageniculatus, and n. limitans. The rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule provided a small projection to n. lateralis posterior and dorsalis, whereas the caudal part projected heavily to these nuclei and less heavily to n. pulvinaris oralis and medialis, and n. suprageniculatus. The superior temporal gyrus projection to the posterior thalamus was to n. geniculatus medialis (pars magnocellularis and parvocellularis), n. suprageniculatus, and n. pulvinaris oralis and medialis. Spinothalamic fibers terminated in n. posterior lateralis, n. suprageniculatus, n. geniculatus medialis (pars magnocellularis), n. medialis dorsalis, and n. centralis lateralis. A few terminal ramifications were apparent in caudoventral n. pulvinaris oralis. The areas of overlap of ascending and descending connections in the posterior thalamus, exclusive of the primary sensory relay nuclei, were n. geniculatus medialis (pars magnocellularis), n. suprageniculatus, n. limitans, and the caudoventrai part of n. pulvinaris oralis. It is possible that these areas as well as the region of their poorly defined boundaries with n. ventralis posterior lateralis and medialis constitute a nuclear group comparable to the posterior nuclear group of the cat thalamus.",,

The autoradiographic data indicated that: areas 8a, 45 and 46 on the convexity and 11 and 12 on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe received projections from PM; areas 20, 21 and 22 in temporal lobe received projections from PM primarily with caudal-medial parts of PM projecting to more rostral-dorsal parts of temporal lobe and rostral-lateral parts of PM projecting to more caudal-ventral parts of temporal lobe but PL also sends some efferents to caudal temporal lobe; areas 5 and 7 in parietal lobe and 18 and 19 in occipital lobe received projections primarily from the region in pulvinar comprising PL and PI with the more ventral parts of this region projecting to the ventral-lateral parts of occipital lobe and the more dorsal parts of this region projecting to the more dorsal-lateral and medial parts of parieto-occipital cortex and with PM contributing slightly to these projections rostrally. The autoradiographic information on the pulvinar projections to frontal lobe and temporal pole was supplemented by data derived from cortical HRP injections. These indicated that although only PM of the pulvinar subnuclei projected to these regions, three other caudal thalamic structures, i.e., medial dorsal nucleus, nucleus limitans and suprageniculate nucleus also projected to these regions raising some questions about the identity of the densocellular part of the medial dorsal nucleus which has also been considered to be part of pulvinar. The laminar distribution of pulvinar cortical efferents was uniformly similar regardless of the pulvinar recipient area examined. Elevated numbers of silver grains were observed over all cortical layers, but the silver grains were densest over the deep parts of layer III. The thalamic reticular nucleus was the only diencephalic structure observed to receive projections from pulvinar and it did so from PM, PL and PI. The pulvinar's efferents are to homotypical rather than heterotypical cortex and its connections are most extensive with cortex rather than with subcortical structures.",,

Willis. A role for the dorsal column in nociceptive visceral input into the thalamus of primates. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 3143–3150, 1998. A possible role of the dorsal column (DC) in the processing of visceral pain has gained attention after studies in the rat have revealed that the DC transmits a major part of the pelvic visceral nociceptive input from the colon into the thalamus. Furthermore, clinical interventions aimed at interrupting ascending DC axons near the midline were successful in relieving the pain suffered by patients with cancer of the pelvic organs. The purpose of this study was to check whether a DC lesion in monkeys would reduce the responses of thalamic neurons to graded colorectal distension (CRD) as in rats. Experiments were done on anesthetized male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Extracellular single cell recordings were made in the ventrolateral complex of the thalamus, mainly the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus, in response to visceral and cutaneous stimulation. Of 80 VPL cells isolated, CRD activated 25, inhibited 25, and had no effect on 30 neurons. The responses of six viscerosensitive VPL neurons were recorded before and after a lesion of the DC at or above the T10 spinal segment. Lesions of other spinal tracts were made after the DC lesion. The results show that the DC lesion significantly reduced the responses of the thalamic neurons tested with CRD by >50%. Lesions of other tracts did not have a consistent effect. These results corroborate findings in the rat and support the proposal that the DC plays an important role in transmitting nociceptive visceral input into the thalamus and subsequently in visceral pain.",,

A morphologically distinct region, possessing a sparse and diffuse distribution of large and small neurons is identified. The region includes several nuclei previously separately named by Olszewski45. These are nuclei VPLo, VLc, X, VLps, and some cellular extensions into the VLo nucleus. The whole zone is continuous, and it is shown that no clear separation exists between any of the previously identified sub-nuclei. Connectional grounds are given for suggesting that this region should be considered as a common cerebellar relay nucleus to motor cortex. Morphological criteria for distinguishing the cellsparse nucleus from adjacent nuclei are given. These cytological criteria provide a basis for the experimental analysis of cortical and subcortical connectivity of the ventral lateral thalamic region. Close attention was paid to the border between the VPLo nucleus and the VPLc nucleus. VPLc is separated from VPLo by a clear border, and no transitional zone can be detected in the parasagittal or horizontal planes. Previous ambiguities in the delineation of the VPLo-VPLc border probably stem from analysis in the frontal plane, in which the border is not clear.",monkey thalamus; ventral lateral region; cytoarchitecture;,

Examination of the synaptic organization in unreacted tissue revealed several distinct synaptic types distributed among glomerular and nonglomerular regions of the neuropil. Within glomeruli, three presynaptic terminal classes were found. The majority of profiles (as many as eight to ten per glomerulus) were presynaptic dendrites (PSDs) forming symmetric synaptic contacts with a central dendrite, and occasionally with other PSDs. One or two largo terminals densely packed with round vesicles (LR terminals) were also present in each glomerulus. This terminal class made multiple asymmetric contacts with the central dendrite, as well as with many PSDs within the glomerulus. Finally, small terminals with round vesicles (SR terminals) formed asymmetric synaptic junctions with PSDs in some glomeruli. PSDs and SR terminals were also found in the extraglomerular neuropil, although in different proportions than in the glomeruli. In the extraglomerular neuropil SR terminals were the most abundant terminal class and these terminals made synaptic contacts with dendrites of all sizes. PSDs were seen in considerably smaller numbers than in the glomeruli. Finally, the extraglomerular neuropil contained a moderate number of small to medium terminals that formed, symmetric synaptic junctions (SF terminals) with cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes. Synaptic profiles related to corticothalamic inputs were identified by injecting the prefrontal cortex of two rhesus monkeys with 3H-leucine and -proline and analyzing the distribution and morphology of radiolabeled terminals. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains over different tissue compartments revealed a positive labeling index for two terminal classes: SR and LR terminals. Labeled SR terminals were concentrated in the extraglomerular neuropil and labeled LR terminals were found within glomeruli where they formed synaptic contact with the central dendrite, as well as with presynaptic dendrites of the glomerulus. In contrast to many other thalamic nuclei, cortical input to the mediodorsal nucleus arrives via two distinctive synaptic pathways, one terminating extraglomerularly and the other terminating within the synaptic glomeruli. The dual mode of corticothalamic terminations in the mediodorsal nucleus suggests a more potent and possibly different role for cortical input in the regulation of neuronal activity in this association nucleus than in sensory nuclei of the thalamus.",,

Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10–15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre médian/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons.

Fibers forming a lateral pathway travel in the fronto-occipital fasciculus and connect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the fundus of the rhinal sulcus, posterior subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. A larger medial pathway forms in the cingulum bundle and terminates in the most caudal part of the presubiculum, as well as in adjacent transitional cortices. These cortices form a caudomedial promontory that is located between the posterior cingulate and prestriate areas. In all allo- and mesocortical targets of prefrontal cortex, labeled terminals form banding patterns reminiscent of the columnar organization of afferent fiber columns in neocortex. The same cytoarchitectonic areas that receive prefrontal afferents issue reciprocal projections. The largest source is the caudomedial lobule including its presubicular portion. Neurons in the para-hippocampal gyrus and adjacent presubiculum also are retrogradely labeled following implants of horseradish peroxidase or injection of fluorescent dyes into prefrontal cortex. In addition, subicular neurons project to the prefrontal cortex although the subiculum does not appear to receive prefrontal afferent input. These findings emphasize that multiple channels of communication link the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum and adjacent transitional cortices. We speculate that each of these prefrontal projections may carry highly specific information into the hippocampus, whereas the reciprocal projections may allow retrieval by prefrontal cortex of memories stored in the hippocampus.",CA; Ammon's horn; FB; Fast Blue; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; NY; Nuclear Yellow; PS; principal sulcus; TMB; tetramethylbenzidine;,

The proprioceptive/vestibular area 3aV, the neck-trunk region of area 3a, receives two thirds of its thalamic projections from the oral and superior ventroposterior nucleus (VPO/VPS), which is considered as the proprioceptive relay of the ventroposterior complex (Kaas et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 226:211–240, 1984). The parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC, area retroinsularis, Ri) receives its main thalamic input from posterior parts of the ventroposterior complex and from the medial pulvinar. Anatomical evidence is presented that the posterior region of the ventroposterior complex is a special compartment within this principal somatosensory relay complex. The parietotemporal association area T3, mainly involved in visual-optokinetic signal processing, receives a substantial input from the medial, the lateral, and the inferior pulvinar. Dual tracer experiments revealed that about 5% of the thalamic neurons projecting to 3aV were spatially intermingled with neurons projecting to areas PIVC or T3. This spatial intermingling was distributed over small but numerous, circumscribed thalamic regions, called “common patches,” which were found mainly in the intralaminar nuclei, the posterior group of thalamic nuclei, and the caudal parts of the ventroposterior complex. The “common patches” may indicate a functional coupling of area 3aV with the PIVC or area T3 on the thalamic level. In control experiments thalamic projections to the granular insula Ig and the anterior part of area 7, two cerebral structures connected with the vestibular cortical areas, were studied. Some overlap in the thalamic relay structures projecting to these areas with these areas with those projecting to the vestibular cortices was found. A quantitative evaluation of thalamic regions projecting to different cortical structures was performed by constructing so-called “thalamograms.” A scheme was developed that describes the afferent thalamic connections by which vestibular, visual-optokinetic, and proprioceptive signals reach the vestibular cortical areas PIVC and 3aV. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Neurons responding to both compressive and phasic brush stimuli (multireceptive neurons), but not brush-specific (low-threshold) neurons, in the partially deafferented thalamus showed increased spontaneous activity, increased responses evoked by cutaneous stimuli and larger mean receptive field size than the same types of cells in the thalamus with intact innervation. The spike train properties of both the spontaneous and evoked discharges of cells were also altered so that there was an increased incidence of spike-bursts in cells of deafferented thalamus. These changes were widespread in the thalamus, and included cells in both the fully innervated forelimb representation and the partially denervated hindlimb representation ipsilateral to the lesion. The spontaneous and evoked spike trains in the ipsilateral thalamus also show increased frequency of both spike-burst and non-burst events compared to the intact thalamus. These results indicate that chronic spinothalamic tract lesion produces widespread changes in the physiological properties of a discrete cell population of the thalamus. The findings in this study indicate that the thalamic processing of somatosensory information conveyed by the lemniscal system is altered by transection of the spinothalamic tract. This change in sensory processing in the thalamus would result in altered cortical processing of innocuous somatosensory inputs following deafferentation and so possibly contribute to the generation of the central pain syndrome.","central pain; monkey; spike train; deafferentation; neuropathy; CPS, central pain syndrome; IS, inter-spike interval; LT, low-threshold (neurons); MR, multireceptive (neurons); RF, receptive field; VPL, ventral posterior lateral nucleus; WDR, wide dynamic range (neurons);",

Prominent inputs arise in the amygdaloid complex, restricted areas of the cerebral cortex, parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus, and nuclei of the lower brainstem. Autoradiographic tracing experiments indicate that the amygdaloid fibers are distributed throughout the NHDB and the NBM, and to a lesser extent to the ventral pallidum. Relatively few fibers innervate the more medially located nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band (NVDB) and the medial septal nucleus. Visualization of the amygdalofugal fibers with the tracer PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris leuco-agglutinin) shows that they have varicosities resembling boutons en passant along their length in the substantia innominata. Retrograde tracing experiments using WGA-HRP indicate that the cells of origin of the projection from the amygdala are concentrated in the parvicellular basal nucleus, the caudal part of the magnocellular basal nucleus, the magnocellular accessory basal nucleus, and the central nucleus. Relatively few fibers to the substantia innominata arise in the rostrodorsal part of the magnocellular basal nucleus, or in the lateral or parvicellular accessory basal nuclei.

Diencephalic cells projecting to the substantia innominata are distributed diffusely throughout the preoptic area and hypothalamus, with higher concentration in the lateral preoptic area and in the pre-, supra-, and tuberomammillary nuclei. Cells are also found in the midline thalamic nuclei and in the region between the peripeduncular and subparafascicular nuclei.

This is in part because spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons that project to the posterior thalamus have received little attention. In this study, antidromic mapping was used to identify individual STT neurons with axons that projected specifically to the posterior thalamus in Macaca fascicularis. Each axon was located by antidromic activation at low stimulus amplitudes (<30 μA) and was then surrounded distally by a grid of stimulating points in which 500-μA stimuli were unable to activate the axon antidromically, thereby indicating the termination zone. Several nuclei within the posterior thalamus were targets of STT neurons: the posterior nucleus, suprageniculate nucleus, magnocellular part of the medial geniculate nucleus, and limitans nucleus. STT neurons projecting to the ventral posterior inferior nucleus were also studied. Twenty-five posterior thalamus-projecting STT neurons recorded in lumbar spinal cord were characterized by their responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Sixteen of 25 neurons were recorded in the marginal zone and the balance was located within the deep dorsal horn. Thirteen neurons were classified as wide dynamic range and 12 as high threshold. One-third of STT neurons projecting to posterior thalamus responded to noxious heat (50°C). Two-thirds of those tested responded to cooling.

Further, consistent evidence in animal models shows the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) contributes to adaptive decision-making. It is assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial temporal lobes govern these cognitive processes so this evidence suggests that MD contributes a role in these cognitive processes too. Anatomically, the MD has extensive excitatory cortico-thalamo-cortical connections, especially with the PFC. MD also receives modulatory inputs from forebrain, midbrain and brainstem regions. It is suggested that the MD is a higher order thalamic relay of the PFC due to the dual cortico-thalamic inputs from layer V (‘driver’ inputs capable of transmitting a message) and layer VI (‘modulator’ inputs) of the PFC. Thus, the MD thalamic relay may support the transfer of information across the PFC via this indirect thalamic route. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the anatomy of MD as a higher order thalamic relay. It also reviews behavioral and electrophysiological studies in animals to consider how MD might support the transfer of information across the cortex during learning and decision-making. Current evidence suggests the MD is particularly important during rapid trial-by-trial associative learning and decision-making paradigms that involve multiple cognitive processes. Further studies need to consider the influence of the MD higher order relay to advance our knowledge about how the cortex processes higher order cognition.",Associative learning; Glutamate; Human; Macaque; Prefrontal cortex; Primate; Recognition memory; Reticular thalamus; Rodent;,

In one monkey, rendered severely parkinsonian by MPTP, there was a marked increase in the uptake of 2DG in the globus pallidus (both medial and lateral segments) and in the ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei, in comparison to non-parkinsonian animals. Increased uptake of 2DG in the globus pallidus may reflect increased activity of striatopallidal synapses secondary to loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones.

The HRP was placed from 3 to 5 mm caudal to the descending columns of the fornix. Additional information came from a series of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasciculata) with anterograde tracer injections in the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum, together with the entorhinal cortex (EC) and perirhinal cortex (area 35) contribute numerous axons to the fornix in a topographical manner. In contrast, the lateral perirhinal cortex (area 36) and parahippocampal cortical areas TF and TH only contained a handful of cells labeled via the fornix. The medial fornix originates from cells in the caudal half of the subiculum, the lamina principalis interna of the caudal half of the presubiculum, and from the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The intermediate portion of the fornix (i.e., that part midway between the midline and most lateral parts of the fornix) originates from cells in the rostral half of the subiculum and prosubiculum, the anterior presubiculum (only from the lamina principalis externa), the caudal presubiculum (primarily from lamina principalis interna), the rostral half of CA3, the EC (primarily 28I and 28M), and the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The lateral parts of the fornix arise from the rostral EC (28L only) and the most rostral portion of CA3. Subcortically, the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the thalamic nucleus reuniens all send projections through the fornix, which presumably terminate in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal region. These results not only help to define those regions that project via the fornix, but also reveal those subcortical projections to the hippocampal formation most likely to rely entirely on nonfornical pathways.

Here, we describe a fourth major pathway originating from mesencephalic dopamine neurons: a mesothalamic system. The dopamine transporter, specific to dopamine containing axons, was histochemically visualized in thalamic motor and limbic-related nuclei and regions that modulate behavioral state as opposed to sensory nuclei in rats, nonhuman primates, and humans. Anatomical tracing established this innervation's origin via axon collaterals from the mesostriatal pathway. These findings implicate the thalamus as a novel site for disease specific alterations in dopamine neurotransmission, such as exist with nigral degeneration attending Parkinson's disease. This was confirmed in hemiparkinsonian animals where reduction of thalamic dopamine innervation occurred coincident with signs of active axonal degeneration. Individual mesencephalic dopamine neurons therefore have the potential to modulate normal and pathologic behavior not only through traditional nigrostriatal pathways but also by way of axon collaterals that innervate the thalamus.",,

Terminal labeling originating from both frontal and parietal injection sites was found to be in apposition in 15 ipsilateral cortical areas: the supplementary motor cortex, the dorsal premotor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex, the anterior arcuate cortex (including the frontal eye fields), the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, the frontoparietal operculum, the insular cortex, the medial parietal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, the presubiculum, the caudomedial lobule, and the medial prestriate cortex. Convergent terminal labeling was observed in the contralateral hemisphere as well, most prominently in the principal sulcal cortex, the superior arcuate cortex, and the superior temporal cortex. In certain common target areas, as for example the cingulate cortices, frontal and parietal efferents terminate in an array of interdigitating columns, an arrangement much like that observed for callosal and associational projections to the principal sulcus (Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz, 1982). In other areas, frontal and parietal terminals exhibit a laminar complementarity: in the depths of the superior temporal sulcus, prefrontal terminals are densely distributed within laminae I, III, and V, whereas parietal terminals occupy mainly laminae IV and VI directly below the prefrontal bands. Subcortical structures also receive apposing or overlapping projections from both prefrontal and parietal cortices. The dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices project to adjacent, longitudinal domains of the neostriatum, as has been described previously (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985); these projections are also found in close apposition in the claustrum, the amygdala, the caudomedial lobule, and throughout the anterior medial, medial dorsal, lateral dorsal, and medial pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. In the brain stem, both areas of association cortex project to the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus and to the midline reticular formation of the pons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2–3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b–4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. J. Comp.

The appropriate location was determined before HRP injection by mapping the characteristic high frequency discharge of single pallidal units in awake animals. In animals with injections confined to the internal pallidal segment, retrograde label was seen in neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, parafascicular nucleus, zona incerta, medial and lateral subthalamic tegmentum, parabrachial nuclei, and locus coeruleus.

To address this question we used neural tracers to label pathways linking areas involved in emotional and attentional processes in the primate brain (Macaca mulatta). We report that a novel pathway from the amygdala, the brain's emotional center, targets the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a key node in the brain's attentional network. The amygdalar pathway formed unusual synapses close to cell bodies of TRN neurons and had more large and efficient terminals than pathways from the orbitofrontal cortex and the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus, which similarly innervated extensive TRN sites. The robust amygdalar pathway provides a mechanism for rapid shifting of attention to emotional stimuli. Acting synergistically, pathways from the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex provide a circuit for purposeful assessment of emotional stimuli. The different pathways to TRN suggest distinct mechanisms of attention to external and internal stimuli that may be differentially disrupted in anxiety and mood disorders and may be selectively targeted for therapeutic interventions.",,

Topography of terminal fields in midbrain and pons,"Frontal eye field (FEF) projections to the midbrain and pons were studied in nine macaque monkeys that were used to study FEF projections to the striatum and thalamus (Stanton et al.: J. Comp. Neurol. 271:473-492, '88). Injections of tritiated amino acids or WGA-HRP were made into FEF cortical locations where low-level microstimulation (≤50 μA) elicited saccadic eye movements, and anterograde axonal labeling was mapped. The injections were made into the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus from dorsomedial sites where large saccades were evoked (lFEF) to ventrolateral sites where small saccades were evoked (sFEF). The largest terminal fields of FEF fibers were located in the ipsilateral superior colliculus (SC). Projections to SC were topographically organized: lFEF sites projected to intermediate and deep layers of caudal SC, sFEF sites projected to intermediate and superficial layers of rostral SC, and FEF sites between these extremes projected to intermediate locations in SC. Patches of terminal labeling were located ipsilaterally in the lateral mesencephalic reticular formation near the parabigeminal nucleus and the ventrolateral pontine reticular formation. These patches were larger from lFEF injections. Small, dense terminal patches were seen in the ipsilateral pontine gray, mostly along the medial and dorsal borders of these nuclei but occasionally in central and dorsolateral regions. Patches of label like those in the pontine nuclei were located ipsilaterally in the reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus in lFEF cases and bilaterally in sFEF cases. Small terminal patches were found in the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsal and medial parts of the parvicellular red nucleus in most FEF cases. In the pretectal region, labeled terminal patches were consistently found in the nucleus limitans of the posterior thalamus, but we could not determine if label in the nucleus of the pretectal area and dorsal parts of the nucleus of the posterior commissure marked axon terminals or fibers of passage. We found small, lightly labeled terminal patches in the pontine raphe between the rootlets of the abducens nerve (three cases) or in the adjacent paramedian pontine reticular formation (one case). Omnipauser cells in this region are important in initiating saccades. In one sFEF case, very small patches of label were located in the supragenual nuclei anterior to the abducens nuclei and in the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi posterior to the abducens nucleus. Presaccadic burster neurons in the periabducens region are known to fire immediately before horizontal saccades. Neither IFEF or SFEF projections appeared to terminate in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, or the motor nuclei of the extraocular muscles.",,

Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Krüger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements (black) better and faster than increments (white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey's primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).",,

Retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons consisted of two separate clusters of neurons, as judged by the continuity of labelled thalamic cells; lateral (VApc, VLo, VLc, VLm, VPLo, VPLc, LP) and medial (VAmc, X, Pcn, Cl, Pulo, Pulm, Pull, MD) ones. In each cluster, neurons in the medial portion tend to project on more rostal cerebral cortices than those in the lateral portion. In the lateral cluster, medially and laterally located thalamic neurons tend to project, respectively, on lateral and medial parts of a cortical area. Retrograde and anterograde labelling revealed that thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections are mostly reciprocal except CM which receives massive terminals from area 4 but projects scarcely on to the area. According to the references which have demonstrated terminations of cerebellothalamic neurons, thalamocortical neurons relaying the cerebellocerebral projection are presumed to be included in both the medial and lateral thalamic cell clusters mentioned above.

The vestibular sensors in the inner ear detect self-motion and in turn send projections via the vestibular nuclei to multiple cortical areas through 2 principal thalamocortical pathways, 1 anterior and 1 posterior. While the anterior pathway has been extensively studied, the role of the posterior pathway is not well understood. Accordingly, here we recorded responses from individual neurons in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus of macaque monkeys during externally applied (passive) and actively generated self-motion. The sensory responses of neurons that robustly encoded passive rotations and translations were canceled during comparable voluntary movement (~80% reduction). Moreover, when both passive and active self-motion were experienced simultaneously, neurons selectively encoded the detailed time course of the passive component. To examine the mechanism underlying the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active motion, we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement. We found that suppression only occurred if the actual sensory consequences of motion matched the motor-based expectation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the posterior thalamocortical vestibular pathway selectively encodes unexpected motion, thereby providing a neural correlate for ensuring perceptual stability during active versus externally generated motion.","corollary discharge, efference copy, exafference, reafference, rhesus monkey",

Behavioral effects of MD lesions were evaluated in 14 young adult rhesus monkeys, using tests known to be sensitive to damage in different regions of the prefrontal cortex. Performance on a spatial delayed alternation task was significantly (P < 0.01) impaired by MD lesions, and this impairment was significantly correlated (rs = 0.52) with damage to the posterior half of the mediodorsal nucleus. Such damage was also correlated significantly (rs = 0.51) with performance on another spatial memory task, delayed response; monkeys that sustained the largest lesions of the posterior mediodorsal nucleus were significantly (P < 0.05) impaired on this task relative to operated animals suffering the least posterior MD damage. In contrast to their performance on spatial memory tasks, operated animals were not impaired on tests of object reversal or visual pattern discrimination. These results indicate that lesions of the mediodorsal nucleus can elicit a specific syndrome of spatial memory loss qualitatively similar to that observed after damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.",mediodorsal nucleus; monkeys; delayed-response; memory;,

Restricted areas of the lateral and posterior orbital cortex had specific connections with visual-, somatosensory-, olfactory-, gustatory-, and visceral-related structures. More medial areas received few direct sensory inputs. Within the lateral and posterior orbital cortex, area 121 received a substantial projection from visual areas in the inferior temporal cortex (TE). Area 12m received somatosensory input from face, digit, or forelimb regions in the opercular part of area 1–2, in area 7b, in the second somatosensory area (SII), and in the anterior infraparietal area (AIP). Areas 13m and 131 also received a projection from the opercular part of areas 1–2 and 3b. The posteromedial and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm and Ial, respectively) received fibers from the ventral part of the parvicellular division of the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) that may represent a visceral afferent system. The dorsal part of VPMpc projected to the adjacent gustatory cortex. These restricted inputs from several sensory modalities and the convergent corticocortical connections to orbital areas 13l and 13m suggest a network related to feeding. The OMPFC was also connected to premotor cortex in ventral area 6 (areas 6va and 6vb), in cingulate area 24c, and probably in the supplementary eye field. Area 6va projected to area 12m, whereas a region of area 6vb projected to area 131. The region of the supplementary eye field projected to areas 121, 120, and 12r. Area lal received fibers from area 24c. Lighter and more diffuse projections also reached wider areas of the OMPFC.

Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or tritiated amino acids were injected into the posterior part of area 7, including the caudal end of the superior bank of both the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral sulcus. The posterior parietal cortex was found to be reciprocally connected with three different ipsilateral thalamic nuclei: the nucleus ventralis posterior inferior, the magnocellular part of the medial geniculate nucleus, and some intralaminar nuclei. Through these connections, area 7 might control the vestibulo-ocular response (VOR) by modulating the ascending vestibular information. This cortical area 7 also projects to the ipsilateral intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus and to several ipsilateral pontine nuclei. The dorsolateral pontine nucleus is of particular interest because it is known to be related to smooth pursuit eye movements. Cortical area 7 also was seen to project to the accessory nucleus of Darkschewitsch, to all the vestibular nuclei, and to the nucleus propositus hypoglossi; the last two projections were found to be bilateral with a greater ipsilateral contribution. Efferents from posterior parietal cortex are directed to precise regions within the vestibular nuclei that are specifically involved in vestibulo-ocular reflex, or that are in turn connected with brainstem structures implicated in smooth pursuit eye movements. These connections are consistent with the posterior parietal cortex exerting a multilevel influence on the different systems dealing with eye-head movement coordination.",,

The relation of the resulting patterns of transported label to the cytoarchitecture and cytochrome oxidase architecture of the thalamus lead to three major conclusions. 1) The region traditionally described as the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) is a composite of VP proper and parts of the ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPi). Much of the VP region consists of groups of densely stained, closely packed neurons that project to S-I. VPi includes a ventral oval of pale, less densely packed neurons and finger-like protrusions that extend into VP proper and separate clusters of VP neurons related to different body parts. Neurons in both parts of VPi project to S-II rather than S-I. Connection patterns indicate that the proper and the embedded parts of VPi combine to form a body representation paralleling that in VP. 2) VPi also provides the major thalamic input into PV. 3) In architecture, location, and cortical connections, the region traditionally described as the anterior pulvinar (AP) of monkeys resembles the medial posterior nucleus, Pom, of other mammals and we propose that all or most of AP is homologous to Pom. AP caps VP dorsomedially, has neurons that are moderately dense in Nissl staining, and reacts moderately in CO preparations. AP neurons project to S-I, S-II, and PV in somatotopic patterns. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

We have recently reported that neuropathic orofacial pain is associated with altered thalamic anatomy, biochemistry and activity, which may result in disturbed thalamocortical oscillatory circuits. Despite this evidence, it is possible that these thalamic changes are not responsible for the presence of pain per se, but result as a consequence of the injury. To clarify this subject, we compared brain activity and biochemistry in 12 people with below-level neuropathic pain after complete thoracic spinal cord injury to 11 people with similar injuries and no neuropathic pain and 21 age and gender matched healthy controls. Quantitative arterial spinal labelling was used to measure thalamic activity and magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine changes in neuronal variability quantifying N-acetylaspartate and alterations in inhibitory function quantifying gamma amino butyric acid. This study revealed that the presence of neuropathic pain is associated with significant changes in thalamic biochemistry and neuronal activity. More specifically, the presence of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury is associated with significant reductions in thalamic N-acetylaspartate, gamma amino butyric acid content and blood flow in the region of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Spinal cord injury on its own did not account for these changes. These findings support the hypothesis that neuropathic pain is associated with altered thalamic structure and function, which may disturb central processing and play a key role in the experience of neuropathic pain.",,

To address this knowledge gap, we examined serially sectioned cholinergic axons in supra- and infragranular layers of the macaque prefrontal cortex by using an antibody against the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The tissue bound antibody was visualized with both immunoperoxidase and silver-enhanced diaminobenzidine sulfide (SEDS) techniques. Both methods revealed that cholinergic axons make synapses in all cortical layers and that these synapses are exclusively symmetric. Cholinergic axons formed synapses primarily on dendritic shafts (70.5%), dendritic spines (25%), and, to a lesser extent, cell bodies (4.5%). Both pyramidal neurons and cells exhibiting the morphological features of GABAergic cells were targets of the cholinergic innervation. Some spiny dendritic shafts received multiple, closely spaced synapses, suggesting that a subset of pyramidal neurons may be subject to a particularly strong cholinergic influence. Analysis of synaptic incidence of cholinergic profiles in the supragranular layers of the prefrontal cortex by the SEDS technique revealed that definitive synaptic junctions were formed by 44% of the cholinergic boutons. An unexpected finding was that chohnergic boutons were frequently apposed to spines and small dendrites without making any visible synaptic specializations. These same spines and dendrites often received asymmetric synapses, presumably of thalamocortical or corticocortical origin. Present ultrastructural findings suggest that acetylcholine may have a dual modulatory effect in the neocortex: one through classical synaptic junctions on dendritic shafts and spines, and the other through nonsynaptic appositions in close vicinity to asymmetric synapses. Further physiological studies are necessary to test the hypothesis of the nonsynaptic release of acetylcholine in the Cortex. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating “feedforward” loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([3H]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA–VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA–VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits.","thalamocortical, corticothalamic, ventral anterior, ventral lateral, mediodorsal, frontal cortex",

These maps can be used for the precise anatomical localization of activated foci as found in functional imaging studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate population maps of the human acoustic radiation (AR) for the purpose of brain mapping studies. Thus, a stereotaxic 3-D representation of the human AR was computed which includes myeloarchitectonic probabilistic maps of AR and its thalamic origin, i.e. the cytoarchitectonically defined medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). These maps were compared with earlier, mostly schematic drawings of AR and MGN. To generate these maps, the degree of intersubject variability of AR and MGN in each stereotaxic position was quantified for the standard axes (x, y, and z) of the reference space in a series of 10 adult human postmortem brains. The results show that the location and volumes of AR and MGN vary considerably between individuals and hemispheres. It is demonstrated that this striking degree of spatial variations may lead to structural–functional mismatch in brain mapping studies based on the Talairach atlas (discrepancy maps). Furthermore, the volumetric measures showed no hemispheric asymmetry for AR and MGN.

Accordingly, the effects of several different lateral frontal lesions were compared on two spatial tasks, one which did involve intratrial delays (delayed alternation) and one which did not (a conditional position response test). The findings indicated the existence of two functionally distinct subdivisions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: one in the principal sulcus, damage to which was responsible for impaired performance on the spatial task with delay; and the other in the arcuate sulcus, removal of which was responsible for impaired performance on the spatial task without delay. These findings together with those of other investigators suggest that the cortex in the principal sulcus may be concerned with a form of spatial memory, whereas the arcuate cortex is concerned with some other, as yet unspecified function.",,

The thalamus was stained immunocytochemically for parvalbumin and 28 kDa calbindin in normals and in brains in which retrogradely transported tracers were injected into middle layers of auditory cortical areas or applied to the cortical surface. Parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cells show a complementary distribution in ventral, anterodorsal, post and magriocellular medial geniculate nuclei. The ventral nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and few calbindin cells, and the anterodorsal nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and moderate numbers of calbindin cells. Both nuclei have a dense parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuropil formed by terminations of fibers ascending in the brachium of the inferior colliculus. The posterodorsal nucleus has approxi mately equal proportions of parvalbumin and calbindin cells; neuropil staining is weak but contains terminations of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers ascending in the midbrain tegmenturn. The magnocellular nucleus contains domains of parvalbumin and calbindin cells. Parvalbumin cells in the ventral nucleus project to a central core of auditory cortex with densest parvalbumin immunoreactivity. Those in anterodorsal and posterodorsal nuclei project to surrounding auditory fields with less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity; those in the magnocellular nucleus project widely to auditory and other fields.

However, there is relatively little evidence detailing the interactions between mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex linked to cognition in primates. This study investigated these interactions during learning, memory, and decision-making tasks in rhesus monkeys using a disconnection lesion approach. Preoperatively, monkeys learned object-in-place scene discriminations embedded within colorful visual backgrounds. Unilateral neurotoxic lesions to magnocellular mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impaired the ability to learn new object-in-place scene discriminations. In contrast, unilateral ablations to ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex (PFv+o) left learning intact. A second unilateral MDmc or PFv+o lesion in the contralateral hemisphere to the first operation, causing functional MDmc–PFv+o disconnection across hemispheres, further impaired learning object-in-place scene discriminations, although object discrimination learning remained intact. Adaptive decision-making after reward satiety devaluation was also reduced. These data highlight the functional importance of interactions between MDmc and PFv+o during learning object-in-place scene discriminations and adaptive decision-making but not object discrimination learning. Moreover, learning deficits observed after unilateral removal of MDmc but not PFv+o provide direct behavioral evidence of the MDmc role influencing more widespread regions of the frontal lobes in cognition.","amnesia, decision-making, dysfunction, learning, monkey, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex",

While evidence suggests that populations of cortical neurons synchronize their activity to preferentially transmit information about attentional priorities, it is unclear how cortical synchrony across a network is accomplished. Based on its anatomical connectivity with the cortex, we hypothesized that the pulvinar, a thalamic nucleus, regulates cortical synchrony. We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system using diffusion tensor imaging and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuo-spatial attention task.

GABA-immunoreactive cell bodies and axon terminals were visualized in all thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey but their relative density varied from one nucleus to the other. At the level of the anterior nuclear group, GABA-positive cells and terminals abounded in the anterodorsal nucleus but were much less numerous in the anteromedial and anteroventral nuclei. In the nuclei of the ventral group, GABA-immunoreactive cells were found to be smaller and less numerous than nonimmunoreactive neurons. In the ventral anterior nucleus, GABA-positive neuronal profiles formed typical clusters, whereas they were more uniformly distributed in the posterior nuclei of the ventral group. In the intralaminar nuclei, GABA-immunoreactive cells and terminals abounded in the dorsal portion of the paracentral and centrolateral nuclei, whereas more caudally, GABA-positive terminals pervaded the entire parafascicular nucleus. In the mediodorsal nucleus, GABA-positive cell bodies and axon terminals formed typical clusters of various sizes scattered within the lateral parvocellular portion of the nucleus, while GABA-immunoreactive neuronal profiles were less numerous and more uniformly distributed in the medial portion of this structure. In the nuclei of the posterior group, GABA-immunoreactive neuronal profiles were uniformly distributed except in the pulvinar where they abounded in the inferior and oral parts but were scarce in the medial part. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the magnocellular layers received the most massive GABA-positive innervation and contained the largest number of GABA-immunoreactive cell bodies. In the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, GABA-positive cells occurred only ventrolaterally while GABA-immunoreactive terminals pervaded the entire structure. In the medial geniculate nucleus, GABA-immunoreactive cell bodies and terminals abounded particularly within the ventromedial third of the structure. In the habenula, a few GABA-immunoreactive cell bodies and numerous GABA-positive terminals were scattered throughout the lateral habenular nucleus, whereas only a few GABA-immunoreactive terminals surrounded the closely packed unreactive cells in the medial habenular nucleus. In contrast to other thalamic nuclei all neurons in the reticular nucleus displayed GABA immunoreactivity. Moreover, GABA-positive cells of the reticular nucleus were found to be significantly larger than those in the adjoining thalamic nuclei. The results of the present study reveal that GABA-immunoreactive neurons are much more numerous and more widely distributed in the thalamus of the squirrel monkey than in that of the rat and the cat.

Over the course of the last decades, diverse attempts have been made to map and describe subcortical neuromodulatory afferents to the primate thalamus, including axons using acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and histamine. Our group has been actively involved in this endeavor. The published descriptions on neuromodulatory afferents to the primate thalamus have been made in different laboratories and are not fully comparable due to methodological divergences (for example, fixation procedures, planes of cutting, techniques used to detect the afferents, different criteria for identification of thalamic nuclei…). Such variation affects the results obtained. Therefore, systematic methodological and analytical approaches are much needed. The present article proposes reproducible methodological and terminological frameworks for primate thalamic mapping. We suggest the use of standard stereotaxic planes to produce and present maps of the primate thalamus, as well as the use of the Anglo-American school terminology (vs. the German school terminology) for identification of thalamic nuclei. Finally, a public repository of the data collected under agreed-on frameworks would be a useful tool for looking up and comparing data on the structure and connections of primate thalamic nuclei. Important and agreed-on efforts are required to create, manage, and fund a unified and homogeneous resource of data on the primate thalamus. Likewise, a firm commitment of the institutions to preserve experimental brain material is much needed because neuroscience work with non-human primates is becoming increasingly rare, making earlier material still more valuable.","Thalamus, Thalamic nuclei, Acetylcholine, Dopamine, Adrenaline, Noradrenaline, Serotonin, Histamine",

The cladistic analysis carried out here allows us to recognize which features are plesiomorphic and which apomorphic for the dorsal thalamus of jawed vertebrates and to then reconstruct the major changes that have occurred in the dorsal thalamus over evolution. Embryological data examined in the context of Von Baerian theory (embryos of later-descendant species resemble the embryos of earlier-descendant species to the point of their divergence) supports a new ‘Dual Elaboration Hypothesis’ of dorsal thalamic evolution generated from this cladistic analysis. From the morphotype for an early stage in the embryological development of the dorsal thalamus of jawed vertebrates, the divergent, sequential stages of the development of the dorsal thalamus are derived for each major radiation and compared. The new hypothesis holds that the dorsal thalamus comprises two basic divisions—the collothalamus and the lemnothalamus—that receive their predominant input from the midbrain roof and (plesiomorphically) from lemniscal pathways, including the optic tract, respectively. Where present, the collothalamic, midbrain-sensory relay nuclei are homologous to each other in all vertebrate radiations as discrete nuclei. Within the lemnothalamus, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of mammals and the dorsal lateral optic nucleus of non-synapsid amniotes (diapsid reptiles, birds and turtles) are homologous as discrete nuclei; most or all of the ventral nuclear group of mammals is homologous as a field to the lemniscal somatosensory relay and motor feedback nuclei of non-synapsid amniotes; the anterior, intralaminar and medial nuclear groups of mammals are collectively homologous as a field to both the dorsomedial and dorsolateral (including perirotundal) nuclei of non-synapsid amniotes; the anterior, intralaminar, medial and ventral nuclear groups and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of mammals are collectively homologous as a field to the nucleus anterior of anamniotes, as are their homologues in non-synapsid amniotes. In the captorhinomorph ancestors of extant land vertebrates, both divisions of the dorsal thalamus were elaborated to some extent due to an increase in proliferation and lateral migration of neurons during development. Mammals are unique in the degree to which their synapsid ancestors further elaborated the lemnothalamus, so that the identity of and previous experience with objects in their environment has become their most salient priority.",Evolution; Dorsal thalamus; Diencephalon; Forebrain; Jawed vertebrate; Mammal; Cladistic analysis;,

It is considered to be a major component of the limbic system and has been shown to subserve a wide range of autonomic and somatic motor functions. The anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate cortex can be differentiated according to their thalamic afferents as well as their patterns of corticocortical connectivity. The primate cingulate cortex is traditionally divided into a series of cytoarchitec tonic zones that can be distinguished along a ventral-dorsal axis of differentiation in both the anterior (areas 25, 24a, 24b, and 24c), and posterior (areas 29, 30, 23a, 23b, and 23c) regions. However, little is known about the precise cellular organization of these subareas. In the present study, we attempt to define the neuronal morphological and biochemical composition of the different cingulate cortex subareas, using antibodies to the neurofilament triplet protein and calcium-binding proteins. Results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the structure and functions of the cingulate cortex and the immunostaining patterns. For instance, distribution of neurofilament-rich pyramidal neurons parallels that of specific corticocortical and corticosubcortical systems and is a useful marker to delineate the cingulate motor area. Calcium-binding protein-containing neurons display a high degree of regional and laminar specialization. In particular, parvalbumin-positive interneurons are codistributed with neurofilament-immunoreactive pyramidal cells along the ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal axes of the cingulate cortex. Calbindin- and calretinin-positive immunostaining show more monotonous laminar and regional patterns, although they exhibit a particular labeling in area 29 that may correspond to the termination of select thalamocortical afferents. These chemoarchitectural patterns of regional and laminar neuronal specialization may be envisioned as the reflection of the richness of cortical diversity in the cingulate gyrus, and make it an ideal place to explore the interplay of the distributions of various neuron types in cortical areas of known function.",,

Cortico-pulvinar neurons were identified in one heterotypical cortical area (area 17) and in many homotypical areas in frontal (areas 45, 46, 11, 12), parietal (5, 7), occipital (18, 19) and temporal (20, 21, 22) lobes. The cortico-pulvinar neurons were pyramidal in shape and ranged in size from small to large. In heterotypical cortex they were found in layers V and VI whereas in area 17 they were found only in layer Vb. Reciprocal connections between pulvinar and cortex were a feature of homotypical but not heterotypical cortex.",,

Microelectrode recordings from clusters of selectively thermoreceptive or nociceptive neurons were used to guide precise micro-injections of various tracers in VMpo. A prior report (Craig and Zhang, 2006) described retrograde tracing results, which confirmed the selective lamina I input to VMpo and the antero-posterior (head to foot) topography. The present report describes the results of micro-injections of anterograde tracers placed at different levels in VMpo, based on the antero-posterior topographic organization of selectively nociceptive units and clusters over nearly the entire extent of VMpo. Each injection produced dense, patchy terminal labeling in a single coherent field within a distinct granular cortical area centered in the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus. The terminations were distributed with a consistent antero-posterior topography over the posterior half of the superior limiting sulcus. These observations demonstrate a specific VMpo projection area in dorsal posterior insular cortex that provides the basis for a somatotopic representation of selectively nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic activity. These results also identify the VMpo terminal area as the posterior half of interoceptive cortex; the anterior half receives input from the vagal-responsive and gustatory neurons in the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMb).","lamina I, spinothalamic, pain, thermosensory, homeostasis",

To reveal patterns of gene expression in the visual thalamus correlated with physiological processing streams, we designed a custom ferret cDNA microarray. By isolating specific subregions and layers of the thalamus, we identified a set of transcription factors, including Zic2, Islet1, and Six3, the unique distribution profiles of which differentiated the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) from the associated perigeniculate nucleus. Within the LGN, odd homeobox1 differentiated the A layers, which contain X cells and Y cells, from the C layers. One neuron-specific protein, Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4), was strongly expressed in Y cells in the ferret LGN and in the magnocellular layers of the primate LGN. In the ferret LGN, PCP4 expression began as early as postnatal day 7 (P7), suggesting that Y cells are already specified by P7. These results reveal a rich molecular repertoire that correlates with functional divisions of the LGN.","microarray, transcription factors, lateral geniculate nucleus, development, Y cell, PCP4, visual cortex",

 of auditory cortical areas in the rhesus monkey have led to the
 hypothesis that acoustic information is processed in series and in
 parallel in the primate auditory cortex. Recent physiological
 experiments in the behaving monkey indicate that the response
 properties of neurons in different cortical areas are both functionally
 distinct from each other, which is indicative of parallel processing,
 and functionally similar to each other, which is indicative of serial
 processing. Thus, auditory cortical processing may be similar to the
 serial and parallel “what” and “where” processing by the
 primate visual cortex. If “where” information is serially
 processed in the primate auditory cortex, neurons in cortical areas
 along this pathway should have progressively better spatial tuning
 properties. This prediction is supported by recent experiments that
 have shown that neurons in the caudomedial field have better spatial
 tuning properties than neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Neurons
 in the caudomedial field are also better than primary auditory cortex
 neurons at predicting the sound localization ability across different
 stimulus frequencies and bandwidths in both azimuth and elevation.
 These data support the hypothesis that the primate auditory cortex
 processes acoustic information in a serial and parallel manner and
 suggest that this may be a general cortical mechanism for sensory
 perception.",,

We examined the soma distributions of all those corticospinal neuron populations projecting to different zones in the cervical and more caudal spinal segments in the macaque that are labeled with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers; 2–4 differentiable dyes were injected into different sites in the cervical spinal cord of each of 11 monkeys. Lamina V of the cerebral cortex, in which all corticospinal neuron somas were located, was unfolded with computer assistance to form a flat surface, and local soma densities were displayed on this plane as contour and 3-D maps. At least nine discrete, somatotopically organized corticospinal projections were identified. Three separate corticospinal projections originated in frontal cortex. The first projected mostly from area 4 (≈35% of the total contralateral neuron population), but also from the adjacent dorsolateral area 6α (≈6% of total). The second large corticospinal projection (≈15% of total) originated in the supplementary motor area and a third small projection (≈2.6% of total) projected from the “postarcuate” cortex. Two separate corticospinal neuron populations were identified in areas 24 (≈6% of total) and 23 (≈4% of total) of the cingulate cortex. Thus, nearly 70% of the contralateral corticospinal projection originated in fromtal and cingulate cortex. At the boundary between the primary motor and somatosensory cortex there was a sharp change in the pattern of projections. Only ≈2.2% of the contralateral corticospinal projection originated in area 3a, rising to ≈9% in areas 3b/1, and ≈13% in areas 2/5. The projections from SII and insula totaled 3.4%. Ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal projection patterns were similar, but the ipsilateral projection was only ≈8.1% of that from the contralateral cortex. Each corticospinal neuron population had terminals in the intermediate zone of all spinal segments; additionally, there were ventral horn projections from the primary motor and cingulate cortex, and dorsal horn projections from the somatosensory cortex. Recognizing a number of separate populations of corticospinal neurons in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortex, each with unique thalamic and cortical inputs, and each of which has continuous access to all spinal motoneuron populations, underlines the importance of cortical and spinal connections linking them and coordinating their action. No coherent model of the cortical control of limb movements that incorporates this functional anatomy yet exists.",,

This was accomplished by applying microiontophoretically horseradish peroxidase and tritiated amino acids into low threshold stimulation sites within hindlimb, forelimb and face representations of the SMI as defined by intracortical microstimulation. Injections into the SMI produced labeling in distinct sets of specific and non-specific thalamic nuclei. The former included the ventrolateral (VL), ventromedial (VM), posteromedial (Pom) and posterior (Po) nuclei, and the latter included the centrolateral (CL), paracentral (PC), centromedial (CeM) and parafascicular (PF) nuclei. The densest labeling, both retrograde and anterograde, was found in the VL, and to a slightly lesser extent, in the Pom nuclei. Labeling of specific nuclei was more extensive than in non-specific groups. Thalamic-SMI projections were reciprocal in nature with the exception of the reticular thalamic nucleus (R). The ventrobasal (VB) nucleus was labeled only after injections into the SMI representations of the hindlimb and forelimb. A topographic organization between the SMI and dorsal thalamic nuclei was indicated by the varied position of label following injections into different cortical representations. Injections into the hindlimb representation resulted in labeling in the rostrodorsolateral VL, ventrolateral VM, rostrodorsomedial Pom, dorsal Po, rostrodorsolateral R, dorsolateral PF, CL and PC. In contrast, injections into the face representation resulted in labeling in the caudoventromedial VL, dorsolateral VM, caudoventrolateral Pom, ventral Po, caudoventromedial R, ventrolateral PF, the PC, CeM and ventral CL. The position of thalamic labeling following injections into the forelimb representation was intermediate between that for hindlimb and face representations. In coronal section, distinct patterns of labeling were identified in all specific thalamic nuclei following injections into each topographic region of the SMI. In the VL, labeling appeared as an obliquely-oriented, longitudinal strip or band (more C-shaped following injections of the hindlimb representation); in the VM as a horizontal strip; in the Pom as an irregular V-shaped band; and in the Po as a circular-to-ovoid cluster. No distinct patterns of labeling were discerned in non-specific nuclei. Labeling in the anterior grouping of non-specific nuclei overlapped to a large extent, but this was not the case in either the specific thalamic nuclei or the PF nucleus. These findings are compared with those previously reported in the rat, and are discussed with regard to both the functional organization of the rat SMI and the interconnectional relations between the SMI and dorsal thalamus in other species.",Somatic motor cortex; Dorsal thalamus; HRP histochemistry; Autoradiography;,

Although it was at first proposed to play a role in long-term memory, a set of recent studies in animals and humans has revealed a more complex, and broader, role in several cognitive functions. The MD seems to play a multifaceted role in higher cognitive functions together with the prefrontal cortex and other cortical and subcortical brain areas. Specifically, we propose that the MD is involved in the regulation of cortical networks especially when the maintenance and temporal extension of persistent activity patterns in the frontal lobe areas are required.","mediodorsal thalamus, memory, neuroimaging, persistent activity, prefrontal cortex, temporal extension",

The density of callosal projection neurons, which are mainly located in the supragranular layers, varies both within and across cytoarchitectonic areas (Killackey et al., '83). In the present study, we investigated the ontogeny of corpus callosum projections of the postcentral gyrus in five fetal rhesus monkeys, ranging in age from embryonic day (E) 108 to E 133. Multiple large injections of horseradish peroxidase that involved the underlying white matter were made into the postcentral gyrus of one hemisphere and the distribution of labeled neurons in the ipsilateral thalamus and the other hemisphere was determined. The pattern of thalamic label indicated that the tracer was effectively transported from all portions of the postcentral gyrus. We found that the areal distribution pattern of labeled callosal projection neurons varied at the different fetal ages. At early fetal ages (E 108, E 111, and E 119) callosal projection neurons were continuously distributed throughout the postcentral gyrus. As in the adult animal, the vast majority of labeled callosal projection neurons were found in the supragranular layers, although a few labeled cells were located in the infragranular layers. From the earliest age, there was regional variation in the width of the band of labeled supragranular callosal projection neurons. The difference between the precentral and postcentral gyrus was most obvious, but there was also a difference between anterior and posterior portions of the postcentral gyrus. The first indication of some discontinuity in the distribution of callosal projection neurons was noted at E 126. By E 133, approximately 1 month before birth, the distribution of callosal projection neurons appeared remarkably mature. On E 119 aggregations of anterograde label could be detected in restricted portions of the posterior postcentral gyrus beneath the cortical layers. By E 133 anterograde label was found within the cortical layers (most densely in layer IV) in these regions of the postcentral gyrus. Thus, the emergence of the discrete pattern of callosal projection neurons appears to be temporally correlated with the ingrowth of callosal afferents. On the basis of these observations, as well as those of others (discussed in the text), we propose that the ontogenetic changes in the distribution of callosal projection neurons reflect the unique strategy employed by cortical projection neurons in establishing their patterns of connectivity. It is hypothesized that this strategy may involve multiple processes.",,

CM was found to project massively to the putamen, where terminal fields appeared principally in the form of oblique bands, and more diffusely to the dorsolateral border of the caudate nucleus. Striatal inputs from Pf were found more rostrally, especially in the ventromedial portion of the putamen, the entire ventromedial half of the caudate nucleus, and the ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. Pf terminal fields in the rostral striatum often displayed a patchy organization. Both CM and Pf projections were found to terminate in the matrix compartment of the striatum as defined by acetylcholinesterase staining. These results suggest that CM is more specifically involved in sensorimotor and Pf in associative and limbic aspects of basal ganglia function in primates.",Basal ganglia; Striatum afferent; Thalamostriatal projection; Anterograde tracing method; Wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase experiment; Saimiri sciureus; Primate;,

The analysis was carried out on coronal brain sections taken through the hippocampus and thalamus at the level of the geniculate nuclei. High densities of β-amyloid protein precursor695 and β-amyloid protein precursor751 messenger RNAs were found in the medial aspects of the mediodorsal, centromedian and parafascicular nuclei of the 17-year-old monkeys. The messenger RNA levels of the 695 and 751 isoforms were about two- and seven-fold, respectively, those found in the same nuclei of the three-year-old animals. The levels of these messenger RNA transcripts in the 17-year-old monkeys were not significantly different from those in the three-year-old animals in other brain areas e.g. the temporal cortex, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. No Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology in terms of diffuse or senile β-amyloid plaques, dystrophic neurites or neurofibrillary tangles were detectable by specific innumohistochemical procedures in the above thalamic nuclei of the 17-year-old animals. In addition no reactive gliosis was seen in the thalamus of these monkeys. The presence of increased levels of β-amyloid protein precursor695 and β-amyloid protein precursor751 messenger RNAs and the absence of any Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in the thalamus of the middle-aged monkeys may suggest that enhanced transcription of the β-amyloid protein precursor gene may precede by many years any manifestation of the β-amyloid protein accumulation/deposition.

mediodorsal thalamus: Evidence for a general principle of indirect thalamic
pathways between directly connected cortical areas","Our ability to act flexibly, according to goals and context, is known as
cognitive control. Hierarchical levels of control, reflecting different levels
of abstraction, are represented across prefrontal cortex (PFC). Although the
mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) is extensively interconnected with PFC, the
role of MD in cognitive control is unclear. Tract tracer studies in macaques,
involving subsets of PFC areas, have converged on coarse MD-PFC connectivity
principles; but proposed finer-grained topographic schemes, which constrain
interactions between MD and PFC, disagree in many respects. To investigate a
unifying topographic scheme, we performed probabilistic tractography on
diffusion MRI data from eight macaque monkeys, and estimated the probable paths
connecting MD with each of all 19 architectonic areas of PFC. We found a
connectional topography where the orderly progression from ventromedial to
anterior to posterolateral PFC was represented from anteromedial to
posterolateral MD. The projection zones of posterolateral PFC areas in MD showed
substantial overlap, and those of ventral and anteromedial PFC areas in MD
overlapped. The exception was cingulate area 24: its projection zone overlapped
with projections zones of all other PFC areas. Overall, our data suggest that
nearby, functionally related, directly connected PFC areas have partially
overlapping projection zones in MD, consistent with a role for MD in
coordinating communication across PFC. Indeed, the organizing principle for PFC
projection zones in MD appears to reflect the flow of information across the
hierarchical, multi-level PFC architecture. In addition, cingulate area 24 may
have privileged access to influence thalamocortical interactions involving all
other PFC areas.","Thalamocortical, mediodorsal thalamus, prefrontal cortex, diffusion MRI, macaque, replication principle",

Two developments mandate a re-evaluation of this notion. First, we present a synopsis of our anatomical studies in monkey elucidating principles of organization of cerebral cortex. Efferent fibers emanate from every cortical area, and are directed with topographic precision via association fibers to ipsilateral cortical areas, commissural fibers to contralateral cerebral regions, striatal fibers to basal ganglia, and projection subcortical bundles to thalamus, brainstem and/or pontocerebellar system. We note that cortical areas can be defined by their patterns of subcortical and cortical connections. Second, we consider motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with lesions restricted to basal ganglia, thalamus, or cerebellum, and recognize that these lesions mimic deficits resulting from cortical lesions, with qualitative differences between the manifestations of lesions in functionally related areas of cortical and subcortical nodes. We consider these findings on the basis of anatomical observations from tract tracing studies in monkey, viewing them as disconnection syndromes reflecting loss of the contribution of subcortical nodes to the distributed neural circuits. We introduce a new theoretical framework for the distributed neural circuits, based on general, and specific, principles of anatomical organization, and on the architecture of the nodes that comprise these systems. We propose that neural architecture determines function, i.e., each architectonically distinct cortical and subcortical area contributes a unique transform, or computation, to information processing; anatomically precise and segregated connections between nodes define behavior; and association fiber tracts that link cerebral cortical areas with each other enable the cross-modal integration required for evolved complex behaviors. This model enables the formulation and testing of future hypotheses in investigations using evolving magnetic resonance imaging techniques in humans, and in clinical studies in patients with cortical and subcortical lesions.","Cognition, Anatomy, Connections, Fiber tracts, Distributed neural systems",

Additional degenerating fibers coursing through the extreme capsule enter the dorsal portion of the insular cortex that contains numerous degenerating axon ramifications, especially abundant in the infragranular layers. A field of very dense terminal degeneration occupies the dorsal two-thirds and tapers to a narrow lateral zone in a more ventral part of the putamen. Terminal degeneration is also present in the body of the caudate nucleus, but no degenerating fibers can be identified in the globus pallidus. Dense terminal degeneration is present in the nucleus lateralis posterior of the thalamus and extends among the adjacent cells of the nucleus reticularis thalami.

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.",,

I. Progression of neurological signs and neuroanatomical lesions,"Rhesus monkeys were subjected to one, two, or four periods of thiamine deficiency to determine how the number of deprivation episodes affects the development and progression of neurological and neuropathological changes. Recrurent thiamine deprivation produced all major neurological signs and most of the anatomical lesions found in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Neither the number and gravity of neurological symptoms nor the extent or location of lesions was related to the number of deprivation periods in a simple way. Thus, some structures, such as the inferior colliculus and medial vestibular nuclei, were affected after only one period of deficiency. Other structures, such as the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, were more resistant and exhibited degeneration only after four periods of thiamine deprivation. Severe damage in the basal ganglia was infrequent and was associated with prolonged rather than multiple periods of deprivation. No parenchymal damage was found in the mammillary bodies or mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, suggesting that lesions in these prominent sites of damage in Wernicke-Korsakoff disease develop only in the most advanced stages of thiamine deprivation. As a consequence of individual differences in susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, neurological symptoms and signs were more related to the profile of neural damage than to the number or duration of deprivation episodes.",,

Comparative observations were made on Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis). Differential staining of fiber plexuses, probably of thalamic origin, identifies a central core zone of dense iznmunostaining and a surrounding zone of moderate-to-dense immunostaining composed of anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields. Outside the second zone, there is a third anterolateral zone of weaker immunoreactivity, and, outside that zone, there is a fourth zone in which immunoreactivity is virtually absent. Differences in parvalbumin immunostaining in the auditory fields may reflect differences in relative contributions of thalamic inputs from parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells in the medial geniculate complex. The central core zone and the surrounding three fields can be correlated with major auditory fields previously defined by multiunit mapping and thalamocortical connectivity. The core zone contains a large principal field and an anterior extension. The pattern of corticocortical connections between thse and adjoining fields suggests that the anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields represent first steps in three streams of connections passing outward from auditory into association cortex. M. fuscata has an unusually large auditory cortex that is more deeply placed in the lateral sulcus in comparison to that of M. fascicularis. A small annectant gyrus provides a guide to the position of the primary auditory area. © Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

This report analyzes the distribution of the GABA-producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), stained with monoclonal antibody, in human and rhesus monkey thalami and compares it with staining patterns of some widely used cytoskeletal and calcium binding protein markers. GAD65 immunoreactivity distinctly labeled two systems: fibers and terminals of basal ganglia thalamic afferents and local circuit neurons, revealing fine features of GABAergic circuitry in the human thalamus. Gross distribution patterns of GAD65 were identical in human and rhesus monkey thalami. The area displaying specific staining of large-caliber beaded fibers coincided with nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent territories previously identified in monkeys with anterograde tracers. Accordingly, a similarly stained region in the human thalamus was considered basal ganglia territory. Except for cytoarchitecture, no specific markers differentiating between the nigro- and pallidothalamic projection zones within this territory were found. GAD65 staining in the cerebellar afferent territory reflected organization of its local circuit neuron network, distinguishing it from adjacent nuclei. Specific GAD65 staining pattern and negative calcium binding protein immunoreactivity identify the cerebellar afferent territory in humans. It is subdivided further into ventral and dorsal regions based on the cytoskeletal protein SMI31 staining pattern.

We recorded from axons in the white matter below the representation of the hand in postcentral cortex in two monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by using micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). When an axon was recorded, we delineated its receptive field and determined its modality, and if cutaneous, whether it was slowly or rapidly adapting (SA or RA). We then impaled the axon and injected it with HRP. We recorded and successfully injected many more RA than SA axons, possibly because of differences in their true proportions. The RA axonal arbors varied in mediolateral extent from 350 to 800 μ with a mean of 600 μ One of the RA axons gave rise to four separate arbors spanning 2.5-3.0 mm of cortex. The single SA axon we recovered was 370 μ in width. We suggest that the individual terminal zones underlie the columnar parcellation of the somatosensory cortex. The presence of arbors spanning several such columns suggests that all regions within the arbor may not be equally effective in driving cortical cells under normal conditions, and such arbors may provide the substrate for a cortical response to alterations in the pattern of input.",,

Using simultaneous intracortical and intrathalamic recordings, we demonstrate here that the thalamic deactivation occurring at sleep onset most often precedes that of the cortex by several minutes, whereas reactivation of both structures during awakening is synchronized. Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep. Thus, asynchronous thalamo-cortical deactivation while falling asleep probably explains the production of hypnagogic hallucinations by a still-activated cortex and the common self-overestimation of the time needed to fall asleep.","intracranial recording, EEG, dimension of activation, thalamus, wake-to-sleep transition",

Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei.",,

Although this leads to a rapid succession of discontinuous and fragmented retinal snapshots, we perceive the world as stable and coherent. Neural mechanisms underlying visual stability may depend on internal monitoring of planned or ongoing eye movements. In the macaque brain, a pathway for the transmission of such signals has been identified that is relayed by central thalamic nuclei. Here, we studied a possible role of this pathway for perceptual stability in a patient with a selective lesion affecting homologous regions of the human thalamus. Compared with controls, the patient exhibited a unilateral deficit in monitoring his eye movements. This deficit was manifest by a systematic inaccuracy both in successive eye movements and in judging the locations of visual stimuli. In addition, perceptual consequences of oculomotor targeting errors were erroneously attributed to external stimulus changes. These findings show that the human brain draws on transthalamic monitoring signals to bridge the perceptual discontinuities generated by our eye movements.","saccade, corollary discharge, efference copy, extraretinal",

We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53%) and/or auditory beep (61%) or click (91%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.",,

The midbrain nucleus raphe dorsalis was the major site of origin for neurons providing a serotoninergic projection to the ventral posterolateral nucleus. A few retrogradely labeled serotonin-containing neurons were also observed in the central superior and the raphe pontis nuclei.

The basic principle of a parallel organization of connections among the forebrain structures also holds for the rat. This chapter focuses on the organization of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that involve different parts of the PFC (prefrontal cortex) and on the association of the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei and the amygdala with these circuits in the rat. The topographical organization in the corticostriatal, striatopallidal, pallidothalamic, and MD-PFC connections recognizes at least four circuits that involve cytoarchitectonically distinct areas of the PFC. The projections of individual nuclei of the nonspecific thalamic complex and of particular parts of the amygdala to the prefrontal cortical and striatal way stations of the principal circuits are in register with the parallel arrangement of these circuits. The principle of a parallel organization in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit's cortex is diagrammatically represented in the chapter.

The telencephalic input into the temporopolar cortex arises from the orbitofrontal and medial frontal regions, modality-specific visual and auditory association areas, paralimbic regions, the piriform olfactory cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the claustrum, and the basal forebrain. Afferents from limbic and paralimbic regions are directed mostly to the agranular and dysgranular sectors of the temporal pole, whereas afferents from isocortical association areas are distributed predominantly within the granular sector. The temporopolar cortex provides a site for the potential convergence of sensory and limbic inputs. Auditory inputs predominate in the dorsolateral part of the temporopolar cortex whereas visual inputs become prominent only in the ventral portions of this region. Olfactory inputs are directed mostly to the medial parts of the temporal pole. These medial parts also receive more extensive projections from the amygdaloid nuclei.",,

Here, we examine the response properties of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in the alert macaque monkey and compare these responses to those in the anaesthetized animal. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre–surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.",,

Comparing the different connectivity patterns and the relative PFC size in rats and primates, the evolution of the PFC is most probably a result of both an increase in cortical size and of the segregation and specialization of the cortical regions. The segregation and extension of the cortical ocular dominance columns after birth, which can coincide with the elimination of the neuronal structures that have become exuberant during development, is reviewed in the chapter. It also considers homology criteria in comparing the rat PFC with the primate PFC and the connections with the thalamus, corticocortical connections, and the connections with other subcortical nuclei. Only those cortical areas are included in the PFC for which the reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus are stronger than are the connections with other thalamic nuclei. When the criterion of heaviest reciprocal connections with MD is applied to the current data on thalamic connections, the cortical areas are regarded as PFC areas. The connectivity patterns of the rat and primate MDs are compared in the chapter. It also tabulates the current data on reciprocal cortical connections with the different parts of the mediodorsal nucleus in the rat and primate.

Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 5B (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least the largest pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies.",,

V2 contains three sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions) and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well; terminal label in layers 3–4 was distributed in discrete patches with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and targeted both “thick” (Cat-301+) and “thin” CO-rich stripes, avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers 5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer 6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent thalamic input shared by the “thick” and “thin” CO stripes (which receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests another potential source of integration between the two cortical visual streams.",,

Additionally, in the monkey ventro-lateral nucleus, GABAergic dendro-dendritic contacts between local circuit neurons are found commonly but in the ventral anterior nucleus, they are absent. The chapter also explores whether there are functional differences among the various types of GABAergic synapses found in thalamic nuclei.

They learned a series of new 2-choice visual discriminations between colored patterns displayed on a monitor screen. The feedback for correct choice was the delivery of food. In order to promote associative learning between the visual stimuli and the incentive value of the food reward, reward delivery was not accompanied by any distinctive visual feedback on the display screen. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after surgery in a total of 16 monkeys. Three groups of 3 monkeys received bilaterally symmetrical ablations in either the amygdala, the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. All these groups showed a severe postoperative learning impairment. Seven other animals were given a unilateral ablation in 1 of those 3 structures and a second unilateral ablation, in each case contralateral to and different from the first, in order to produce 2 groups in which a putative amygdalo-thalamo-prefrontal pathway had been disconnected by crossed unilateral lesions. One disconnection group had lesions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex; the other had lesions in the amygdala and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The disconnection groups showed a significant impairment, but the effect of the disconnection surgeries was significantly milder than the effect of any of the 3 bilaterally symmetrical lesions. Therefore, symmetrical bilateral lesions in either the amygdala, the mediodorsal nucleus, or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produce similar impairments in the present task, implying that these structures are functionally related to each other; but the relatively mild effect of disconnecting these structures from each other argues against the hypothesis that they are serial stages in a single, tightly linked functional pathway.",,

The German parcellation and terminology has been mostly used for the human thalamus in neurosurgery atlases; the Anglo-American parcellation and terminology is the most used in experimental research on the primate thalamus. In this article, we review the historical development of terminological and parcellation schemes for the primate thalamus over the last 200 years. We trace the technological innovations and conceptual advances in thalamic research that underlie each parcellation, from the use of magnifying lenses to contemporary genoarchitectonic stains during ontogeny.

The PPC is distinguished from these areas by receiving thalamic afferents from the lateral dorsal (LD), lateral posterior (LP), and posterior (Po) nuclei, in the absence of input from the ventrobasal complex (VB) or dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nuclei. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that PPC is involved in spatial orientation and directed attention. In the present study we used fluorescent retrograde axonal tracers primarily to investigate the cortical connections of PPC, in order to determine the organization of the circuitry by which PPC is likely to participate in these functions, and also to determine how the topography of its thalamic connections differs from that of neighboring cortical areas. The cortical connections of PPC involve the ventrolateral (VLO) and medial (MO) orbital areas, medial agranular cortex (area Fr2), portions of somatic sensory areas Par1 and Par2, secondary visual areas Oc2M and Oc2L, auditory area Tel, and retrosplenial cortex. The secondary visual areas Oc2L and Oc2M have cortical connections which are similar to those of PPC, but are restricted within orbital cortex to area VLO, and within area Fr2 to its caudal portion, and do not involve auditory area Te1. The cortical connections of hindlimb cortex are largely restricted to somatic sensory and motor areas. Retrosplenial cortex, which is medially adjacent to PPC, has cortical connections that are prominent with visual cortex, do not involve somatic sensory or auditory cortex, and include the presubiculum. We conclude that PPC is distinguished by its pattern of cortical connections with the somatic sensory, auditory and visual areas, and with areas Fr2, and VLO/MO, in addition to its exclusive thalamic connectivity with LD, LP and Po. Because recent behavioral studies indicate that PPC, Fr2 and VLO are involved in directed attention and spatial learning, we suggest that the interconnections among these three cortical areas represent a major component of the circuitry for these functions in rats.",,

Following stereotaxic horseradish peroxidase injections into the superior colliculus, large numbers of retrogradely-labelled corticotectal neurons were observed in the prearcuate frontal eye field cortex, dorsal and ventral convexity and sulcus principalis cortex, as well as on the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex. These experiments, taken together with anterograde data derived from other cases in which horseradish peroxidase gel implants were made in various subregions of the granular prefrontal cortex, suggested a topographic organization of prefrontal projections to the tectum. Area 8 (frontal eye field) primarily projected to the stratum intermedium. The dorsal sulcus principalis cortex projected most heavily to the deeper stratum intermedium, stratum profundum and central gray matter, and gave rise to a characteristic line of puffs in the dorsal stratum intermedium. The rostral dorsal convexity and medial prefrontal cortex projected primarily to the stratum profundum and central gray matter. The orbitofrontal cortex lacked projections to the superior colliculus and only contained retrogradely-labelled neurons when the injection spread into the central gray matter. It was also observed that prefrontal corticotectal fibers followed 2 divergent routes to the superior colliculus: the classically-described ‘pedunculo-tegmental’ route, and a ‘transthalamic’ pathway. This more detailed description of a major cortical input to the tectum not only contributes to our understanding of the functional organization of both the granular frontal cortex and the colliculus, but suggests anatomical connectivity which may underlie their roles in oculomotor mechanisms.","DBPS; dorsal bank of principal sulcus; DLCG; dorsolateral central gray; FEF; frontal eye field; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; MD; mediodorsal nucleus, thalamus; PFC; prefrontal cortex; SI; stratum intermedium, superior colliculus; SO; stratum opticum; SP; stratum profundum; SS; stratum superficialis; SZ; stratum zonale, superior colliculus; TMB; tetramethylbenzidine; VA; ventral anterior nucleus, thalamus; VL; ventral lateral nucleus, thalamus;",

Specifically, we compared activity levels evoked during two tasks with essentially identical visual stimulation requiring different attentional demands. During a featural-attention task, the subjects had to discriminate the orientation of a grating; during a control spatial-attention task, they had to localize the position of a target point. Comparison of the resulting activity maps revealed attention-dependent changes in metabolic activity in portions of the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the magnocellular-recipient layers 4Cα and 4B of the striate cortex. In these early stages of the visual system, attention to the orientation of the grating suppressed the metabolic activity in a retinotopically specific band peripheral to the representation of the stimulus. These results favor an early selection model of attention. After a thalamic attention-dependent gating mechanism, irrelevant visual information outside the focus of attention may be suppressed at the level of the striate cortex, which would then result in an increased signal-to-noise ratio for the processing of the attended feature in higher-tier, less retinotopically organized, extrastriate visual areas.",,

Angiotensin IV binds to a high affinity site that is quite distinct in pharmacology and distribution from the angiotensin II AT1 and AT2 receptors and is known as the AT4 receptor. These observations suggest that the AT4 receptor may have multiple central effects. The present study uses in vitro receptor autoradiography, and employs [125I]angiotensin IV to map AT4 receptors in the macaca fascicularis brain. The distribution of the AT4 receptor is remarkable in that its distribution extends throughout several neural systems. Most striking is its localization in motor nuclei and motor associated regions. These include the ventral horn spinal motor neurons, all cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor, abducens, facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Receptors are also present in the vestibular, reticular and inferior olivary nuclei, the granular layer of the cerebellum, and the Betz cells of the motor cortex. Moderate AT4 receptor density is seen in all cerebellar nuclei, ventral thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta, with lower receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Abundant AT4 receptors are also found in areas associated with cholinergic nuclei and their projections, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus, somatic motor nuclei and autonomic preganglionic motor nuclei. AT4 receptors are also observed in sensory regions, with moderate levels in spinal trigeminal, gracile, cuneate and thalamic ventral posterior nuclei, and the somatosensory cortex. The abundance of the AT4 receptor in motor and cholinergic neurons, and to a lesser extent, in sensory neurons, suggests multiple roles for the AT4 receptor in the primate brain.",Motor neuron; Sensory neuron; Cholinergic neuron; Cognition;,

It was found that the DLG projects to area 19 and the anterior portion of area 18 located on the lateral, ventral, and ventromedial surfaces of the hemisphere. There is a general topographical organization such that the medial portion of the DLG projects to dorsal prestriate located between the lunate and superior temporal sulci, while the lateral portion of the DLG projects to ventral prestriate extending from the inferior occipitotemporal sulcus. In contrast DLG inputs to the lunate, superior temporal, and inferior occipital sulci are limited in extent, and involve only a portion of the bank or shoulder of each sulcus which is continuous with the cortex located on the surfaces of the surrounding preoccipital gyri. The projection to the inferior occipital sulcus is more extensive than the ones to the lunate and superior temporal sulci and involves the floor as well as the ventral bank. This means that there are certain functional subdivisions, such as those located within the lunate (eg, visual area 2) and superior temporal sulici which do not receive DLG input. Regardless of the location of these projections the terminal pattern was the same and occurred in horizontally segregated “patches” which were restricted to layer V and the lower, adjacent portion of layer IV. In contrast, the projections from the nearby pulvinar to cortical layers IV, III, and I of the same prestriate areas do not overlap with those from the DLG. An attempt was made to identify possible afferent inputs to these DLG-prestriate paths. The HRP experiments reveal that the DL-Gprestriate cells are concentrated in the DLG interlaminar zones and that their distribution overlaps the distribution of terminals from the superior colliculus and, as shown previously, prestriate cortex. Intraocular injections of radioactive precursors demonstrated transsynaptic transport to a number of structures except prestriate cortex. While the latter result does not prove that the DLG-prestriate cells do not receive retinal input, one conclusion is that the DLG-prestriate projection could be organized like pulvino-prestriate systems which receive their inputs from the midbrain and cortex.",,

Virtually every type of described vocalization was elicited. Such different types of vocalization were not randomly distributed in this system but often specific vocalizations occurred in definite loci.

To examine the full extent and topographic organization of the subcortical projections of MT in the macaque, we injected tritiated amino acids in five cynomolgus monkeys and processed the brains for autoradiography. The injection sites, which we identified electrophysiologically, ranged from the representation of central through peripheral vision in both the upper and lower visual fields and included, collectively, most of MT. Projections from MT to the superior colliculus are topographically organized and in register with projections from striate cortex to the colliculus. Unlike projections from striate cortex, those from MT are not limited to the upper layer of the stratum griseum superficiale but rather extend ventrally from the upper through the lower layer of the stratum griseum superficiale and even include the stratum opticum. Projections from MT to the pulvinar are organized into three separate fields. One field (P1) is located primarily in the inferior pulvinar but extends into a portion of the adjacent lateral pulvinar. The second field (P2) partially surrounds the first and is located entirely in the lateral pulvinar. The third and heaviest, projection field (P3) is located posteromedially in the inferior pulvinar but also includes small portions of the lateral and medial pulvinar that lie dorsal to the brachium of the superior colliculus. While projections from MT to P1 and P2 are topographically organized, there appears to be a convergence of MT inputs to P3. Projections from MT to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus are located in the ventral portion of the nucleus, approximately at the level of the caudal pulvinar. There was some evidence that MT sites representing central vision project more caudally than do those representing peripheral vision. Projections from MT to the caudate, putamen, and claustrum are localized to small, limited zones in each structure. Those to the caudate terminate within the most caudal portion of the body and the tail. Similarly, projections to the putamen are always to its most caudal portion, where the structure appears as nuclear islands. Projections to the claustrum are located ventrally, approximately at the level of the anterior part of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Projections from MT to the pons terminate rostrally in the dorsolateral nucleus, the lateral nucleus, and the dorsolateral portion of the peduncular nucleus. A topographic organization of these projections was not apparent, but there may be a heavier input from the part of MT representing peripheral vision than from the part representing central vision. The results indicate that while subcortical projections of MT in the macaque are more extensive than those of either striate cortex or V2, they are not more extensive than those of V4 and overlap them considerably. The lack of a unique set of subcortical projections from MT suggests that MT's contribution to subcortical visual processing lies in the unique information it supplies.",,

Injections of WGA-HRP in the MO resulted in retrograde labeling of cells in the anteromedial segment of the NRT, the so-called rostral NRT pole. Injections of WGA-HRP and BDA in this NRT region resulted in dense anterograde labeling in the MD. Labeled NRT fibers gave off several collaterals to different MD regions ending with terminal plexuses of thin varicose fibers. In the neuropil, the varicosities were distributed at random, and no tendency to form pericellular baskets was noted. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for GABA was performed on the tissue containing anterograde WGA-HRP label for identification of NRT boutons under electron microscope. The double-labeled boutons were of small to medium size, contained a large number of pleomorphic vesicles, few mitochondria, and formed multiple symmetric synaptic contacts. The number of contacts established by one bouton ranged from 1 to 4 with an average of 1.8 per bouton. About 60% of these boutons made synapses on distal dendrites of GABAergic local circuit neurons; 33% of synaptic contacts were on distal dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, and the rest on their proximal dendrites and soma. NRT boutons were also found in serial synapses and triads. The results demonstrate that the NRT input to the MD is organized so that a single fiber innervates different MD regions and its terminals form numerous synaptic contacts mostly on the distal dendrites of a large number of local circuit neurons and projection neurons.",Primate thalamus; Internal inhibitory circuits; UItrastructure; GABAergic synapse; Synaptic organization;,

Both CM and Pf project massively to the striatum where they arborize in a complementary fashion. On the one hand, CM innervates most of the putamen caudal to the anterior commissure, a dorsolateral rim of the putamen rostral to the anterior commissure, discrete areas of the head of the caudate nucleus close to the internal capsule, and a lateral sector of the body of the caudate nucleus. On the other hand, Pf provides a heavy input to the head, body, and tail of the caudate nucleus, and to the rostral putamen, excluding the areas innervated by CM. In addition, Pf projects more discretely to the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. Therefore, the projections from both CM and Pf cover the entire striatum, with those from CM arborizing into the “sensorimotor” striatal territory and the ones from Pf innervating the “associative-limbic” striatal territory. Furthermore, CM and Pf project to extrastriatal subcortical structures, such as the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, where they also terminate in a complementary fashion. Topographically and cytologically, Pf is closely related to the subparafascicular nucleus (sPf). The Pf-sPf complex projects to the hypothalamus, the substantia innominata, the peripeduncular nucleus, and the amygdala. It also gives rise to descending efferents arborizing in various brainstem structures, including the inferior olivary complex. Additional studies with retrograde double-labeling methods show that distinct cell groups within CM project to the motor cortex and the striatum. Likewise, separate neuronal populations within the CM-Pf-sPf complex give rise to striatal and brainstem projections, the former arising from CM and Pf and the latter mainly from sPf. The complementary nature of CM and Pf projections to the striatum and other basal ganglia components suggests that this thalamic complex participates in a highly ordered manner in the parallel processing of the information that flows through the basal ganglia.",,

In agreement with previous studies in the monkey (Mehler, Bowsher, Kerr) it was found that the spinothalamic tract ascends outside the medial lemniscus, enters the thalamus just dorsal to this structure, and terminates in the posterior, intralaminar and ventral regions, as well as in the zona incerta. The posteromedial nucleus (POm) receives a dense spinothalamic projection medially and ventromedially; elsewhere in the POm the projection is more scattered. The fibers to the intralaminar region terminate in the nucleus centralis laterials (CL) with a distinct pattern of the distribution. The nucleus centralis medialis (CeM) has a minute projection. There was no evidence for somatotopic organization in the projections to the POm or to the intralaminar region. The distribution of the terminal degeneration in the ventral nuclear region was more complex. Although present in the whole nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL), the degeneration was unevenly distributed and also extended beyond the VPL. So-called clusters of dense degeneration lay in the outskirts of the forelimb and hindlimb representation areas, namely at its ventral, ventrolateral, dorsolateral, and medial borders. Centrally the degeneration was scattered. Thus, most of the VPL receives only a sparse spinothalamic projection, but a small portion contains dense networks of terminal spinal fibers. A somatotopic pattern was evident, for after low thoracic lesions most of the medial VPL lacked degeneration. Spinothalamic fibers pass beyond the VPL to terminate in a zone of transition (nucleus ventralis intermedius or V.im of Hassler, '59; Mehler, '71) between the rostral pole of the VPL and the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL). This zone also reportedly receives cerebellar and vestibular afferent fibers. Observations suggesting that the evolution of the spinothalamic tract and the spino-cervico-thalamic pathway in carnivores and primates may be linked are discussed. The spinothalamic clusters in the monkey's VPL appear to be homologous to much of the cervicothalamic tract projection to the VPL in the cat.",,

The efferent projections from this striatal region in the primate were traced by using 3H aminoacids and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Particular attention was paid to the topographic organization of terminal fields in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, the projections to non-extrapyramidal areas, the relationship between projections from the nucleus accumbens and the other parts of the ventral striatum, and the comparison between ventral and dorsal striatal projections. This study demonstrates that in monkeys a circumscribed region of the globus pallidus receives topographically organized efferent fibers from the ventral striatum. The ventral striatal fibers terminate in the ventral pallidum, the subcommissural part of the globus pallidus, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of the internal segment. The more central and caudal portions of the globus pallidus do not receive this input. This striatal output appears to remain segregated from the dorsal striatal efferent projections to pallidal structures. Fibers from the ventral striatum projecting to the substantia nigra are not as confined to a specific region as those projecting to the globus pallidus. Although the densest terminal fields occur in the medial portion, numerous fibers also extend laterally to innervate the dorsal stratum of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the retrorubral area. Furthermore, they project throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the substantia nigra. Projections from the medial part of the ventral striatum reach the more caudally located pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus unlike the above described terminals in the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum project widely throughout the substantia nigra, a fact that indicates that they may contribute to the integration between limbic and other output systems of the striatum. Finally, the ventral striatum projects to non-extrapyramidal regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, the lateral hypothalamus, and the medial thalamus.",,

However, some studies have demonstrated projections from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamic nuclei to the striatum, suggesting that these nuclei directly modulate the striatum. VA/VL nuclei have specific connections with primary, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor cortices indicating their involvement in motor function. These areas mediate different aspects of motor control such as movement execution, motor learning, and sensorimotor integration. Increasing evidence indicates that functionally related motor areas have convergent projections to the dorsal striatum, suggesting that integration of different aspects of motor control occur at the level of the striatum. This study examines the organization of VA/VL thalamic inputs to the dorsal “motor” striatum to determine how this afferent projection is organized with respect to corticostriatal afferents from motor, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Motor cortical projections to specific dorsal striatal regions arose from multiple areas, including components from primary motor, premotor, supplementary, and cingulate motor areas. Diverse motor cortical projections to a given dorsal striatal region indicated convergence of functionally related corticostriatal motor pathways. Most dorsal striatal sites received dense thalamic inputs from the VL pars oralis nucleus. Additional thalamostriatal projections arose from VA, VL pars caudalis, and ventral posterior lateral pars oralis nuclei and Olszewski's Area X. Our results provide evidence for convergent striatal projections from interconnected ventral thalamic and cortical motor areas, suggesting that these afferents modulate the same striatal output circuits.","thalamostriatal, corticostriatal, ventral anterior, ventral lateral, supplementary motor area, cingulate cortex",

GABA receptors are ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), including the thalamus. This region is an important target for sensory information, acting as a relay to several cortical areas. The nociceptive input is modulated in the thalamus by intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms. Because GABA mediates most inhibitory actions in the thalamus, the distribution of the three currently known receptor subtypes, GABA , GABAB , and GABAC , in particular nuclei of the thalamus, may give some clues on its involvement in the processing of nociceptive information. The chapter provides an overall picture of the distribution of GABA receptors subunits in the thalamus, both during development and adulthood, and also focuses on the reports that implicate thalamic GABA receptors in the modulation of nociceptive input. Studies suggest that in some thalamic nuclei, opioid‐induced antinociception might be mediated by the GABAergic system.",,

Analysis of the topographic and laminar organization of these connections reveal that each of these areas has a differential connection pattern both within the parietal lobe and with respect to motor cortex. Area 3 projects predominantly to area 1 via a horizontal, intracortical fiber system which courses through layers III and V without entering the white matter while other efferents of area 3 to areas 2, 3a and second somatosensory cortex (SII) are less dense and course through the white matter. There is no indication that area 3 efferents terminate in areas 4 or 5. In comparison to area 3, area 1 has a wider projection field. Its primary outflow reaches area 2 via a white matter course while moderately strong connections are directed to areas 3a, S II, 4 and supplementary motor cortex (M II) and a minor projection to area 5. Lesions involving the supragranular layers of area 1 demonstrate that efferents from these layers (II-III) travel directly through the cortex to terminate in layer I of area 3 as well as entering the white matter before terminating in area 2 ventral to the tip of the intraparietal sulcus.

While area 2 also has connections with areas 1, 3a, S II, 6 and M II, it was not observed to project to area 3. In addition, layers I-IV of area 2 ventral to the intraparietal sulcus send a number of horizontally oriented fibers mainly through layer IIIb to terminate in rostral area 7 (area PF of Bonin and Bailey, '47). Thus, the projections of these three subdivisions of the postcentral gyrus indicate that there is a strong and sequential outflow of connections from area 3 to areas 1 and 2, then from area 1 to area 2 and finally from area 2 to area 5 and rostral area 7. Each of these connections originates to a large extent from the supragranular layers. In contrast, connections of these areas in the opposite direction toward the central sulcus are less pronounced.",,

This study explores the organization of the thalamic projections to the ventral striatum in the primate brain by means of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and Lucifer yellow (LY) retrograde tracer techniques. In addition, because functional and connective differences have been described for the core and shell components of the nucleus accumbens in the rat and are thought to be similar in the primate, this study also explores whether these regions of the nucleus accumbens can be distinguished by their thalamic input. Tracer injections are placed in different portions of the ventral striatum, including the medial and lateral regions of the ventral striatum; the central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens; and the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Retrogradely labeled neurons are located mainly in the midline nuclear group (anterior and posterior paraventricular, paratenial, rhomboid, and reuniens thalamic nuclei) and in the parafascicular thalamic nucleus. Additional labeled cells are found in other portions of the intralaminar nuclear group as well as in other thalamic nuclei in the ventral, anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior thalamic nuclear groups. The distribution of labeled cells varies depending on the area of the ventral striatum injected. All regions of the ventral striatum receive strong projections from the midline thalamic nuclei and from the parafascicular nucleus. In addition, the medial region of the ventral striatum receives numerous projections from the central superior lateral nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision of the ventral anterior nucleus, and parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. After injection into the lateral region of the ventral striatum, few labeled neurons are seen scattered in nuclei of the intralaminar and ventral thalamic groups and occasional labeled cells in the mediodorsal nucleus. The central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens, receives a limited projection from the midline thqlamic, predominantly from the rhomboid nucleus. It receives much smaller projections from the central medial nucleus and the ventral, anterior, and medial thalamic groups. The shell of the nucleus accumbens receives the most limited projection from the thalamus and is innervated almost exclusively by the midline thalamic nuclei and the central medial and parafascicular nuclei. The shell is distinguished from the rest of the ventral striatum in that it receives the fewest projections from the ventral, anterior, medial, and lateral thalamic nuclei. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Following injection in the intralaminar region labelled cells were present in the marginal zone both in the spinal trigeminal nuclues and in the spinal dorsal horn. The same areas contained labelled cells after injections in the ventroposterior thalamic region, but in such experiments labelled cells were also present in the lamina IV–V region of the spinal cord, in the gracile and main cuneate nuclei and in the external cuneate nucleus. Thus, the marginal zone of the spinal cord appears to project to at least two of the thalamic regions receiving spinothalamic fibres in the monkey.",,

These are located in the medial hypothalamic/preoptic area, the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) in the midbrain/pons, the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and in the anterior part of the mesial cortex, including the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas. We attempt to determine the locations of each of these representations within the hypothalamus/preoptic area, periaqueductal gray and cortex, based on the available literature on activation of brain structures by stimuli that evoke these forms of motivation, on the effects of electrical and chemical stimulation and lesions of candidate structures, and on hodological data. We discuss the hierarchical organization of the representations for a given drive, outputs from these representations to premotor structures in the medulla, caudate-putamen, and cortex, and their contributions to involuntary, learned-sequential (operant) and voluntary behaviors.",,

These responses were also recorded in the motor area following pallidal stimulation (Nambu et al., 1988; 1991). An anatomical study was also carried out on the T-C projections from the motor thalamic subdivisions in monkeys using autoradiography (Nakano et al., 1992). The latter fmdings demonstrated that the basal ganglia territories of the motor thalamic subdivisions give rise to superficial T-C projections, whereas the cerebellar territories give rise only to deep T-C projections. Recent studies, using modem axonal tracing techniques, have reported a possible overlap of basal ganglia and cerebellar inputs in the thalamic subdivisions (Rouiller et al., 1994; Sakai et al., 1996). We have reported that the lateral parts of the nucleus ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) receive cerebellar afferents from the ventral part of the dentate nucleus (Nakano et al., 1996).

In addition, recent positron emission tomography studies implicate the subgenual region in depression and mania. To determine the subcortical projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in area 25 in three monkeys. In contrast to the efferents from area 25 previously described in the rat, there were no projections to autonomic effector regions, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract, magnocellular neurosecretory cell groups in the hypothalamus, ventrolateral medulla, or intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. However, projections were shown to a number of structures with probable roles in autonomic function and direct connections to some of the abovementioned autonomic effector regions, including bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, perifornical and anterior hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and lateral parabrachial nucleus. In addition, there were projections to several forebrain structures that receive projections from other components of the medial prefrontal network including the medial part of the caudate nucleus, lateral septum, midline and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, the lateral parvocellular part of the basal accessory amygdaloid nucleus, and the magnocellular part of the basal amygdaloid. None of the injections resulted in labeling in the medulla. These connections support the idea of a role for cortical area 25 in emotional and autonomic responses, albeit less direct than that described in rodents. J. Comp.

Material was obtained from brains cut in the frontal, horizontal, and parasagittal planes. Our results indicate that the ventrolateral thalamic region (VL) of owl monkeys is a heterogeneous structure composed of several architectonic subdivisions that resemble divisions that have been described in macaques and other Old World anthropoids. All of these subdivisions are more readily distinguished in AChE than in Nissl or CO preparations. The anterior part of VL, VLa (VLo of Olszewski), is characterized by clusters of medium-sized, darkly stained neurons. VLa is also distinguished by AChE-positive cells embedded in a matrix of neurites as well as by a characteristic dark, irregular net of blood vessels. The posterior part of VL is rather uniform cytoarchitectonically and contains large, darkly stained, and sparsely distributed neurons. However, we were able to distinguish three subdivisions of posterior VL that closely correspond to structures described by Olszewski in macaques: a principal segment, VLp (VPLo of Olszewski), a medial segment, VLx (“area X” of Olszewski), and a dorsal segment, VLd (VLc and VLps of Olszewski). In AChE, VLd is much darker than the other divisions. The distinction between VLp and VLx, which together make up the largest part of VL, is less marked, although VLp is somewhat darker and more irregular in appearance in AChE than is VLx. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Four groups of neurons contained cholinergic perikarya and were designated as Chl-Ch4. The Ch1 group corresponds to the medial septal nucleus; about 10% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it provides a substantial projection to the hippocampus. The Ch2 group corresponds to the vertical nucleus of the diagonal band; at least 70% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it is the major source of innervation that the hippocampus and hypothalamus receive from the Chl-Ch4 complex. The Ch3 group most closely corresponds to the horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band; only 1% of its neurons can definitely be shown to be cholinergic, and it is the major source of Chl-Ch4 projections to the olfactory bulb. The Ch4 group most closely corresponds to the nucleus basalis of Meynert; at least 90% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it has projections to widespread areas of cortex and to the amygdala. In fact, the Ch4 group provides the single major source of cholinergic innervation for the entire cortical surface. In this respect, it is analogous to the raphe nuclei and to the nucleus locus coeruleus, which constitute the major sources of widespread cortical serotonergic and nor-adrenergic innervation, respectively. The extensive Ch4 group can be divided into several subdivisions. Each subdivision has a preferential set of targets for its projections even though the connection patterns contain considerable overlap. The anteromedial subdivision of Ch4 is the major source of cholinergic projections to areas on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres; the anterolateral Ch4 sub-division is the major source of cholinergic projections to frontoparietal op-ercular areas and to the amygdala; the intermediate Ch4 subdivision pro-vides the major cholinergic input for a variety of dorsal prefrontal, insular, posterior parietal, inferotemporal, and peristriate areas; and the posterior subdivision of Ch4 provides the major cholinergic innervation of superior temporal and immediately adjacent areas. The basal forebrain in the human contains a cytoarchitechture analogous to that of the monkey. The Ch4 group (nucleus basalis) of the human is very extensive and can be subdivided into the same components that were identfied in the monkey brain. Pathological changes in Ch4 neurons have been described in a variety of human disease. In Alzheimer's disease, the relatively selective depression of neocortical cholinergic innervation may be closely associated with the neuronal loss in Ch4, which has also been described inthis condition. In the rhesus monkey, all types of cortical areas receive substantial projections from the hippocampus. Virtually all of this hypothalamic input into neocortex arises from acetylcholinesterase-rich neurons which lack choline acetyltransferase. The hypothalamocortical pathway is therefore acetylcholinesterase-rich but not cholinergic.",,

The extent of the VPM occupied by terminations of afferent fibers arising in the ipsilateral principal trigeminal nucleus was also determined by anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Both methods indicate that most of the medial half of VPM is occupied by the ipsilateral representation. This is much larger than previously suspected. Units in the medial half of VPM have small, well localized receptive fields on the ipsilateral side of the lower lip, tongue and palate, in the ipsilateral cheek pouch and on the ipsilateral teeth. The representation is largest for the ipsilateral side of the tongue and the cheek pouch. Most units in the lateral half of VPM have small, contralateral receptive fields. Few units in VPM have bilateral receptive fields. VPM is clearly distinguishable by cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining.

RLN3 mRNA is highly expressed in rat, mouse, and human brain and molecular genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that RLN3 is the cognate ligand for the relaxin family peptide-3 receptor (RXFP3). The distribution of RLN3/RXFP3 networks has been determined in rat and mouse brain, but not in higher species. In this study we describe the distribution of RLN3 neurons in the brain of macaque (Macaca fascicularis) using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. RLN3 mRNA and high levels of RLN3-like immunoreactivity (-LI) were observed in neurons within a ventromedial region of the central gray of the pons and medulla that appears to represent the primate analog of the nucleus incertus (NI) described in lower species. Nerve fibers and terminals containing RLN3-LI were observed throughout brain regions identical to those known to receive afferents from the NI in the rat, including the septum, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, lateral, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus, supramammillary and interpeduncular nuclei, anterodorsal, paraventricular and reuniens thalamic nuclei, lateral habenula, central gray, and dorsal raphe, solitary tract, and ambiguus nuclei. Experimental studies in the rat strongly implicate a role of this neuropeptide-receptor system in arousal, feeding, and metabolism, learning and memory, and central responses to psychological stressors. These new anatomical findings support the proposition that the RLN3 system is similarly involved in the integration and modulation of behavioral activation and arousal and responses to stress in nonhuman primates and humans.

There is a significant difference between the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and VA regarding the density of local circuit neurons (LCN), however, in the VL it is about three times higher than in the VA. This is also reflected in staining patterns for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in immunocytochemical preparations both at light and electron microscopic. According to current views, basic biophysical properties of all thalamic neurons are similar and determined by the state of ionic conductance on their membrane. Yet, the synaptic activity can influence these ionic conductances, and if the synaptic inputs are organized differently in different regions, the net effect on the firing pattern of thalamic cells can be different too. The data available so far provide anatomical basis for the functional diversity within the motor thalamus. At the same time, functional relevance of anatomically distinct subdivisions of the motor thalamus in primates can be correlated only indirectly with some clinical findings in parkinsonian patients and experimental behavioral studies utilizing lesions or recordings in different regions of the motor thalamus in monkeys.",,

Underlying this rhythmic sampling are intrinsic theta oscillations in frontal and parietal cortices that provide a clocking mechanism for two alternating attentional states that are associated with either engagement at the presently attended location (and enhanced perceptual sensitivity) or disengagement (and diminished perceptual sensitivity). It has remained unclear, however, how these theta-dependent states are coordinated across the large-scale network that directs spatial attention. The pulvinar is a candidate for such coordination, having been previously shown to regulate cortical activity. Here, we examined pulvino-cortical interactions during theta-rhythmic sampling by simultaneously recording from macaque frontal eye fields (FEF), lateral intraparietal area (LIP), and pulvinar. Neural activity propagated from pulvinar to cortex during periods of engagement, and from cortex to pulvinar during periods of disengagement.

Caudal lateral prefrontal areas (areas 8 and 46) receive projections from cortices representing early stages in visual or auditory processing, and from intraparietal and posterior cingulate areas associated with oculomotor guidance and attentional processes. Cortical input to areas 46 and 8 is complemented by projections from the thalamic multiform and parvicellular sectors of the mediodorsal nucleus associated with oculomotor functions and working memory. In contrast, caudal orbitofrontal areas receive diverse input from cortices representing late stages of processing within every unimodal sensory cortical system. In addition, orbitofrontal and caudal medial (limbic) prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the amygdala, associated with emotional memory, and from medial temporal and thalamic structures associated with long-term memory. Prefrontal cortices are linked with motor control structures related to their specific roles in central executive functions. Caudal lateral prefrontal areas project to brainstem oculomotor structures, and are connected with premotor cortices effecting head, limb and body movements. In contrast, medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal limbic cortices project to hypothalamic visceromotor centers for the expression of emotions. Lateral, orbitofrontal, and medial prefrontal cortices are robustly interconnected, suggesting that they participate in concert in central executive functions. Prefrontal limbic cortices issue widespread projections through their deep layers and terminate in the upper layers of lateral (eulaminate) cortices, suggesting a predominant role in feedback communication. In contrast, when lateral prefrontal cortices communicate with limbic areas they issue projections from their upper layers and their axons terminate in the deep layers, suggesting a role in feedforward communication. Through their widespread connections, prefrontal limbic cortices may exercise a tonic influence on lateral prefrontal cortices, inextricably linking areas associated with cognitive and emotional processes. The integration of cognitive, mnemonic and emotional processes is likely to be disrupted in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases which preferentially affect limbic cortices and consequently disconnect major feedback pathways to the neuraxis.",Orbitofrontal cortex; FEF; Cingulate cortex; Mental disease; Neurologic disease;,

In this study, we used injections of retrograde tracers in the lateral portion of the monkey MD to assess the locations of labeled cells in subcortical structures. Three main patterns were identified in the distribution of subcortical connections. We found that the claustrum, superior colliculus and ventral midbrain regions were heavily labeled in the cases with injections in caudoventral MD. In these cases, labeled cells were also found in either the periaqueductal gray or zona incerta, depending on the specific case. In one case with an injection in anterodorsal MD, labeled cells were most numerous in the structures of the ventral midbrain, especially the ventral tegmental area. Finally, the claustrum and superior colliculus contained the largest percentage of labeled subcortical cells in cases with injections in ventrolateral MD. These three patterns of subcortical label corresponded to three equally distinctive trends in the distribution of MD connections with the cortex in these same cases [J Comp Neurol 473 (2004) 107]. Very few labeled cells were found in other areas such as the amygdala, globus pallidus and deep cerebellar nuclei, suggesting that pathways leading from these structures to dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices are not likely to include the lateral divisions of MD. In concert, these findings show that particular locales within lateral MD receive distinct profiles of subcortical afferents, and project into specific neocortical domains, suggesting that these different sites within lateral MD may participate in functionally distinct circuits of information processing.","ventral anterior nucleus; superior colliculus; substantia nigra; claustrum; periaqueductal gray; ventral tegmental area; AP; anteroposterior; CTb; cholera toxin b; FC; frontal cortex; GPi; globus pallidus internal segment; IP; interpeduncular nucleus; MD; mediodorsal nucleus; MDmf; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, multiform division; MDpc; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, parvicellular division; RRA; retrorubral area; SC; superior colliculus; SNc; substantia nigra pars compacta; SNcd; substantia nigra dorsal compacta; SNlat; substantia nigra pars lateralis; SNr; substantia nigra pars reticulata; VA; ventral anterior; VAmc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, magnocellular division; VTA; ventral tegmental area; ZI; zona incerta;",

Because structure constrains function, quantitative anatomy is an invaluable tool for reducing such a challenging problem. Our goal was to determine the extent to which m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are expressed by inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons in the early visual cortex. To this end, V1 and V2 of macaque monkeys were immunofluorescently labelled for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and either m1 or m2 mAChRs. Among the GABA-immunoreactive (ir) neurons, 61% in V1 and 63% in V2 were m1 AChR-ir, whereas 28% in V1 and 43% in V2 were m2 AChR-ir. In V1, both mAChRs were expressed by fewer than 10% of excitatory neurons. However, in V2, the population of mAChR-ir excitatory neurons was at least double that observed in V1. We also examined m1 and m2 AChR immunoreactivity in layers 2 and 3 of area V1 under the electron microscope and found evidence that GABAergic neurons localize mAChRs to the soma, whereas glutamatergic neurons expressed mAChRs more strongly in dendrites. Axon and terminal labelling was generally weak. These data represent the first quantitative anatomical study of m1 and m2 AChR expression in the cortex of any species. In addition, the increased expression in excitatory neurons across the V1/V2 border may provide a neural basis for the observation that attentional effects gain strength up through the visual pathway from area V1 through V2 to V4 and beyond.

Labeled axons originating in these various regions of the frontal lobe have topographically diverse ipsilateral and contralateral destinations but virtually all of these projections share a common mode of distribution: they terminate in distinct vertically oriented columns, 200–500 μm wide, that extend across all layers of cortex and alternate in regular sequence with columns of comparable width in which grains do not exceed background. Spatial periodicity in the pattern of transported label in such regions as the prefrontal association cortex, the retrosplenial limbic cortex and the motor cortex indicates that columniation in the intracortical distribution of afferent fibers is not unique to sensory specific cortex but is instead a general feature of neocortical organization. A columnar mode of distribution of cortico-cortical projections is present in monkeys at all ages investigated but is especially well delineated in the youngest of them. Thus, grain concentrations within columns are very high in monkeys injected at 4 days of age, somewhat lower in monkeys injected at 39–45 days of age, and least dense in those injected at 5.5 months. The distinctness of the spatially segregated pattern of innervation in the cortex of neonates indicates that the columnar organization of association-fiber systems in the frontal and limbic cortex is achieved before or shortly after birth.",,

Neuroanatomical tracers were injected into electrophysiologically and/or architectonically defined locations, and labeled cell bodies were identified in cortex ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site. Transported tracer was related to architectonically defined boundaries so that the full complement of connections of S2 and PV could be appreciated. Our results indicate that S2 is densely interconnected with the primary somatosensory area (3b), PV, and area 7b of the ipsilateral hemisphere, and with S2, 7b, and 3b in the opposite hemisphere. PV is interconnected with areas 3b and 7b, with the parietal rostroventral area, premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and with the medial auditory belt areas. Contralateral connections were restricted to PV in the opposite hemisphere. These data indicate that S2 and PV have unique and overlapping patterns of connections, and that they comprise part of a network that processes both cutaneous and proprioceptive inputs necessary for tactile discrimination and recognition. Although more data are needed, these patterns of interconnections of cortical fields and thalamic nuclei suggest that the somatosensory system may not be segregated into two separate streams of information processing, as has been hypothesized for the visual system. Rather, some fields may be involved in a variety of functions that require motor and sensory integration. J. Comp. Neurol. 462:382–399, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The mediodorsal thalamus receives a large projection from the rhinal cortex, and has been implicated in recognition memory performance. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier studies, then examined the effect of bilaterally ablating the medial portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Mediodorsal lesion impaired postoperative delayed matching-to-sample performance with a large stimulus set, but had no effect on performance of DMS with a small stimulus population. In comparison with the earlier data from rhinal cortex lesions with the same methods, wherever a deficit was seen in the rhinal-lesioned animals the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals showed a smaller deficit. We conclude that other efferents from the rhinal cortex, possibly those to the adjacent inferior temporal cortex, enable better performance in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals than in the animals with rhinal cortex ablation.",,

I. Oculomotor Signals Sent From Superior Colliculus to Frontal Eye Field Via Mediodorsal Thalamus,"Neuronal processing in cerebral cortex and signal transmission from cortex to brain stem have been studied extensively, but little is known about the numerous feedback pathways that ascend from brain stem to cortex. In this study, we characterized the signals conveyed through an ascending pathway coursing from the superior colliculus (SC) to the frontal eye field (FEF) via mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Using antidromic and orthodromic stimulation, we identified SC source neurons, MD relay neurons, and FEF recipient neurons of the pathway in Macaca mulatta. The monkeys performed oculomotor tasks, including delayed-saccade tasks, that permitted analysis of signals such as visual activity, delay activity, and presaccadic activity. We found that the SC sends all of these signals into the pathway with no output selectivity, i.e., the signals leaving the SC resembled those found generally within the SC. Visual activity arrived in FEF too late to contribute to short-latency visual responses there, and delay activity was largely filtered out in MD. Presaccadic activity, however, seemed critical because it traveled essentially unchanged from SC to FEF. Signal transmission in the pathway was fast (∼2 ms from SC to FEF) and topographically organized (SC neurons drove MD and FEF neurons having similarly eccentric visual and movement fields). Our analysis of identified neurons in one pathway from brain stem to frontal cortex thus demonstrates that multiple signals are sent from SC to FEF with presaccadic activity being prominent. We hypothesize that a major signal conveyed by the pathway is corollary discharge information about the vector of impending saccades.",,

In order to determine the course of CM/Pf degeneration during the MPTP intoxication, motor-asymptomatic animals with partial striatal dopamine denervation were also used. The Cavalieri's principle for volume estimation and the unbiased stereological cell count method with the optical dissector technique were used to estimate the total number of neurons in the CM/Pf. We found substantial neurons loss in the CM/Pf in both, motor-symptomatic MPTP-treated monkeys in which the striatal dopamine innervation was reduced by more than 80 %, and in motor-asymptomatic MPTP-treated animals with 40–50 % striatal dopamine loss. In MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, 60 and 62 % neurons loss was found in CM and Pf, respectively, while partially dopamine-depleted asymptomatic animals displayed 59 and 52 % neurons loss in the CM and Pf, respectively. Thus, our study demonstrates that the CM/Pf neurons loss is an early phenomenon that occurs prior to the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in these animals. In contrast, the neighboring mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus was only mildly affected (18 % neurons loss) in the parkinsonian monkeys. Together with recent findings about the possible role of the CM/Pf-striatal system in cognition, our findings suggest that the pathology of the thalamostriatal system may precede the development of motor symptoms in PD, and may account for some of the cognitive deficits in attentional set-shifting often seen in these patients. Future studies in this animal model, and in monkeys with selective lesion of CM or Pf, are needed to further elucidate the role of the CM/Pf-striatal system in normal and parkinsonian conditions.","Centromedian, Parafascicular, Thalamostriatal, Thalamus, Stereology, Monkey, MPTP",

Before tracer injection, single-unit recordings were made to select injection sites in the forelimb regions where neurons with set- and/or movement-related activity before forelimb movements were densely located. Following the PMd injections, labeled cells were found mainly in rostral portion of VLc and VLo. Cells projecting to PMv were found mainly in X and VPLo. Projection cells to the MI were found in VPLo, VLc, and VLo. Locations of neurons projecting to different motor areas were not overlapped in the thalamic nuclei. Combining available reports, the results suggest that major inputs to PMd come from globus pallidus and that, in contrast, cerebellum is a main source to the PMv.

In humans, ~3.4 million afferents from the LGN are distributed within a V1 surface of ~2,400 mm2, an afferent number that is reduced by half in the macaque and by more than two orders of magnitude in the mouse. Thalamocortical afferents are sorted in visual cortex based on the spatial position of their receptive fields to form a map of visual space. The visual resolution within this map is strongly correlated with total number of thalamic afferents that V1 receives and the area available to sort them. The ~20,000 afferents of the mouse are only sorted by spatial position because they have to cover a large visual field (~300 degrees) within just 4 mm2 of V1 area. By contrast, the ~500,000 afferents of the cat are also sorted by eye input and light/dark polarity because they cover a smaller visual field (~200 degrees) within a much larger V1 area (~ 400 mm2), a sorting principle that is likely to apply also to macaques and humans. The increased precision of thalamic sorting allows building multiple copies of the V1 visual map for left/right eyes and light/dark polarities, which become interlaced to keep neurons representing the same visual point close together. In turn, this interlaced arrangement makes cortical neurons with different preferences for stimulus orientation to rotate around single cortical points forming a pinwheel pattern that allows more efficient processing of objects and visual textures.","thalamus, cortex, primary visual cortex, lateral geniculate nucleus",

We used a roving microelectrode to record vagal-evoked potentials in the thalamus of the macaque monkey. In addition to the anticipated activation in the gustatory/visceral thalamic relay nucleus, we found an unexpectedly larger and earlier response focus with multi-unit discharges in the adjacent parafascicular nucleus.

Dense projections arose from pyramidal cells in layer III of the subiculum and prosubiculum, and terminated in the medial mammillary nucleus. While there was no evidence of an input from the dentate gyrus or fields CA1–3, a small contribution arose from the presubiculum and entorhinal cortices. All of the hippocampal and parahippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies appeared to use the fornix as a route. The caudal portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum contained the greatest numbers of cells projecting to the mammillary bodies. A light contralateral projection to the medial mammillary nucleus was also observed, although this appeared to arise primarily from the more rostral portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum. There was a crude topography within the medial mammillary nucleus, with the caudal subicular projections terminating in the mid and dorsal portions of the nucleus while the rostral subicular and entorhinal projections terminated in the ventral and lateral portions of the medial nucleus. Light ipsilateral projections throughout the lateral mammillary nucleus were sometimes observed. Comparisons with related studies of the macaque brain showed that the dense hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies arise from a population of subicular cells separate from those that project to the anterior thalamic nuclei, even though the major output from the mammillary bodies is to the anterior thalamic nuclei. Other comparisons revealed underlying similarities with the corresponding projections in the rat brain.",,

Here we report a quantitative retrograde tracer analysis in the cynomolgus macaque monkey of the weight consistency of the afferents of cortical areas across brains via calculation of a weight index (fraction of labeled neurons, FLN). Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3% cumulative FLN), high local intrinsic connectivity (80% FLN), high-input form neighboring areas (15% cumulative FLN), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3% cumulative FLN). Corticocortical FLN values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low FLN values.","amygdala, area 17, macaque, network, primate, thalamus",

We examined with the autoradiographic method, in the macaque monkey, the course and terminations of the efferent corticocortical connections of the rostral prefrontal region, the function of which is least understood. Three efferent streams of fibers organized into three distinct fasciculi convey rostral prefrontal influences on posterior cortical areas. These connections provide powerful insights into the cortical regions on which executive control is being exercised. The lateral stream of fibers via the extreme capsule targets the midsection of the auditory superior temporal region and the multisensory areas of the superior temporal sulcus, thus permitting control over the most integrated aspects of cognitive processing. The fibers coursing through the extreme capsule originating in areas 10 and 9 continue as part of the white matter of the superior temporal gyrus (i.e., the middle longitudinal fasciculus) to target the midportion of the superior temporal gyrus (areas TAa, TS2, and TS3) and adjacent multisensory area TPO within the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Some of the fibers from areas 10 and 9 that enter the extreme capsule terminate in the ventral part of the insula. The dorsomedial limbic stream via the cingulate fasciculus targets the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as the retrosplenial cortex, allowing control over motivational and memory processes. A ventral limbic stream via the uncinate fasciculus targets the temporal proisocortex and the amygdala, indicating an additional powerful influence over the emotional motivational sphere.","monkey, frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, association pathways, autoradiography, area 10, connections",

The labelings by [3H]nicotine, [3H]cytisine, and [3H]epibatidine were highly concordant, except for epibatidine. Layer IV of some cortical areas, most thalamic nuclei, and presubiculum displayed high levels of labeling for the three ligands. Moderate levels of binding were detected in the subiculum, the septum, and the mesencephalon. Low levels were present in layers I–II and VI of the cortex, the cornu Ammonis, the dentate gyrus, and the amygdala. In addition, the level of epibatidine labeling was very high in the epithalamic nuclei and the interpeduncular nucleus, whereas labeling by nicotine and cytisine was very weak in the same regions. The distribution of [125I]α-bungarotoxin binding differed from the binding of the three agonists. The labeling was dense in layer I of most cortical areas, dentate gyrus, stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 field, several thalamic nuclei, and medial habenula. A moderate labeling was found in layers V and VI of the prefrontal and frontal cortices, layer IV of primary visual cortex, amygdala, septum, hypothalamus, and some mesencenphalic nuclei. A weak signal was also detected in subiculum, claustrum, stratum oriens, and stratum lucidum of cornu Ammonis and also in some mesencephalic nuclei. The distribution of nicotine, cytisine, and epibatidine bindings corresponds broadly to the patterns observed in rodents, with the marked exception of the epithalamus. However, in monkey, those distributions match the distribution of α2 messenger RNA, rather than that of α4 transcripts as it exists in rodent brains. The distribution of the binding sites for α-bungarotoxin is larger in the brain of rhesus monkeys than in rodent brain, suggesting a more important role of α7 receptors in primates. J. Comp.

The thalamic termination zones for the dentate, interposed and fastigial nuclei are identical and coincide with the cytoarchitectonically unique cell-sparse region of the ventral lateral complex. This region includes nuclei VPLo, VLc, VLps, X64 and extensions of these between the cell clusters of nucleus VLo. The inputs from dentate and interpositus are contralateral dense, and their termination patterns extend continuously throughout all nuclear components of the cell-sparse zone. Interdigitation of these two inputs within the cell-sparse region is directly demonstrated The fastigial input is more restricted but bilateral. Each of the deep cerebellar nuclei also projects to the central lateral nucleus of the intralaminar complex. The strong interconnection of the cell-sparse zone with cortical area 4 is confirmed. The patterns of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical cells and of anterogradely labeled corticothalamic terminations following cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase and of tritiated amino acids, extend continuously through the VPLo-VLc region and its extensions but do not invade the posteriorly situated VPLc nucleus. Thalamic inputs from the dorsal column nuclei terminate independently within the morphologically distinct VPLc nucleus adjacent to the cell-sparse cerebellar terminal zone. The dorsal column-lemniscal terminations do not overlap the cerebellar terminations The clear segregation of the two sets of terminations is demonstrated directly using an anterograde double labeling method. Spinothalamic terminations end in VPLc but extend into the cerebellar terminal zone. Another ascending input, from the vestibular nuclei, is also shown to terminate within the cell-sparse zone. Comparison with other studies implies that cerebellar pallidal and substantia nigral inputs do not converge in the monkey thalamus and that the nuclei in which they terminate project to different cortical areas.

Two series of neurological deficits were found: (1) a failure to grasp food with the mouth when presented contralaterally to the lesion and a reluctance to use the contralateral hand; (2) a severe hemi-inattention. This was present in both the somatosensory and visual modalities but, in the latter, was limited to the peripersonal space. Both motor and attentional deficits improved with time. However, when the symptomatology was stabilized, the animals tended to use the ipsilateral hand and, when presented with two stimuli, preferred that ipsilateral to the lesion. Control experiments in which area 8 (frontal eye fields) was ablated unilaterally showed a decrease of eye movements contralateral to the lesion and a neglect of the contralateral hemispace. No somatosensory deficits were found. The visual neglect was more prominent for ‘far’ space than for that near the animal.

The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a number of modules, which seem to provide multiple subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical connections in subhuman primates. There may be a great degree of convergence of the limbic, associative and motor loops at the level of the striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic input directly as well as indirectly through the striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to behavioral learning by signaling motivation and reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be involved in behavioral state control, learning and reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections as well as the deep cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas, have very dense corticocotrical connections with other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents from the parietal and temporal cortices, and integrated information, via multiple routes, from the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi are linked directly to these areas by ways of the oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and the ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), respectively. These connections are thought to be involved in the acquisition and coordination of motor sequences.",Striatum; Pallidum; Nigral substance; Thalamus; Motor area; Premotor area; Supplementary motor area;,

In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A corollary discharge (CD) circuit within the brain keeps an internal record of physical movements. In monkeys and humans, one such CD keeps track of rapid eye movements, and in monkeys, a circuit carrying this CD extends from midbrain to cerebral cortex through a relay in the thalamus. This circuit provides guidance for eye movements, contributes to stable visual perception, and when defective, might be related to difficulties that schizophrenic patients have in recognizing their own movements. This report facilitates the comparison of the circuit in monkeys and humans, particularly for comparison of the location of the thalamic relay in monkeys and in humans.","corollary discharge, macaque, MD, thalamus",

Advanced imaging techniques have enabled the non-invasive tracing of brain networks to define the human connectome on a millimetre-scale. During early development, the brain undergoes significant changes that are likely represented in the developing connectome, and preterm birth represents a significant environmental risk factor that impacts negatively on early cerebral development. Using tractography to comprehensively map the connections of the thalamocortical unit, we aim to demonstrate that premature extrauterine life due to preterm delivery results in significantly decreased thalamocortical connectivity in the developing human neonate.",Connectome; Developing brain; Preterm birth; Diffusion tractography; Thalamocortical connectivity;,

We addressed this issue by testing the hypothesis that the primate amygdala acts, in part, like a sensory structure for the affective import of stimuli and conveys this information to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, magnocellular part (MDmc). We found that primate sensory cortices innervate amygdalar sites that project to the MDmc, which projects to the orbitofrontal cortex. As in sensory thalamic systems, large amygdalar terminals innervated excitatory relay and inhibitory neurons in the MDmc that facilitate faithful transmission to the cortex. The amygdala, however, uniquely innervated a few MDmc neurons by surrounding and isolating large segments of their proximal dendrites, as revealed by three-dimensional high-resolution reconstruction. Physiologic studies have shown that large axon terminals are found in pathways issued from motor systems that innervate other brain centers to help distinguish self-initiated from other movements. By analogy, the amygdalar pathway to the MDmc may convey signals forwarded to the orbitofrontal cortex to monitor and update the status of the environment in processes deranged in schizophrenia, resulting in attribution of thoughts and actions to external sources.",,

Cortical origins of the corticospinal projections were examined by constructing planar projection maps of the distributions of labeled corticospinal neuron somas; these somas were found only in lamina V. At birth elaborate somatotopically organized corticospinal projections from primary motor cortex (area 4), the mesial supplementary motor area and cingulate areas 23 and 24, area 12, dorsolateral area 6aβ, the dorsolateral and ventral area 6eα (area F4), parietal areas 2/5, 7b and the peri-insular cortex (including area SII), were clearly defined, with axons extending to all spinal cord segments. While this pattern of regional projections broadly resembled that of the mature macaque, there were, however, substantial maturational changes during the 8 months after birth. These included (1) a halving of the area of cerebral cortex from which the contralaterel corticospinal projection originated and (2) a threefold reduction in the number of labeled corticospinal neurons projecting to all segments of the cord. Collateral elimination rather than neuronal cell death was the likely mechanism for this reduction in the population and areal extent of corticospinal neurons in the maturing macaque. The surviving corticospinal axon terminals also developed substantially during the postnatal period. At birth some terminals had invaded the intermediate zone in each spinal segment, but few had penetrated the dorsal and ventral horns. By 6 postnatal months, however, many corticospinal neurons were retrogradely labeled following the injection of fluorescent labels into each of these spinal zones in cervical and lumber spinal segments. These data demonstrate a considerable postnatal reduction in corticospinal neurons projecting to the contralateral spinal cord, and imply that many of the axons that are eliminated never synapse on spinal neurons. It is suggested that during the middle fetal period the axons of many of the cortical neurons in lamina V that in the mature monkey will terminate on particular neuron populations in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord, traverse a common pathway down through the internal capsule into the spinal cord, passing close to these successive targets. and possibly forming collaterals at these levels. In the postnatal period each such neuron establishes a stable, effective synaptic input to only one or a few of these subcortical target populations, and the remaining collateral branches regress. The postnatal maturation of corticospinal neurons, examined in this study, is compatible with such a model.",,

In primates, the limbic system has evolved along with the neocortex and maintains strong connections with association areas. Consequently, damage to limbic structures in primates results in a series of deficits in cognitive, mnemonic and emotional processes. Limbic cortices differ in their structure and connections from the eulaminate areas. Limbic cortices issue widespread projections from their deep layers and reach eulaminate areas by terminating in layer I. By comparison, the eulaminate areas receive projections from a more restricted set of cortices and when they communicate with limbic cortices they issue projections from their upper layers and terminate in a columnar pattern. Several of the connectional and neurochemical characteristics of limbic cortices are observed as a transient feature in all areas during development. Anatomic evidence suggests that limbic areas retain some features observed in ontogeny, which may explain their great plasticity and involvement in learning and memory, but also their preferential vulnerability in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",Macaca mulatta primates; Memory; Limbic system; Plasticity; Learning; Schizophrenia; Epilepsy; Orbitofrontal cortex; Medial prefrontal cortex;,

Five were killed by perfusion-fixation at 2 to 9 days of age. Brains of these and of 2 which were not asphyxiated were studied. A common pattern of structural alteration was encountered in the nervous system of the asphyxiated monkeys.

The cerebral cortex was severely damaged in only one monkey. Lesions began with primary nerve cell and, less frequently, neuroglia cell lysis and loss. Secondary damage of myelin sheaths, and reactions of astrocytes, endothelial cells, vascular adventitial cells, and phagocytes were noted.

Two subjects alternated between periods of making saccades and central fixations while blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images were collected [3 T, (1.5 mm)3 spatial resolution]. BOLD activations from each of four cerebral hemispheres were projected onto the subjects' cortical surfaces and aligned to a surface-based atlas for comparison across hemispheres and subjects. This surface-based analysis revealed patterns of visuo-oculomotor activity across much of the cerebral cortex, including activations in the posterior parietal cortex, superior temporal cortex and frontal lobe. For each cortical domain, we show the anatomical position and extent of visuo-oculomotor activity, including evidence that the dorsolateral frontal activation, which includes the frontal eye field (on the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus), extends anteriorly into posterior principal sulcus (area 46) and posteriorly into part of dorsal premotor cortex (area 6).

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities. These fiber morphologies resemble those from the cortex and raise the possibility that VA/VL thalamostriatal projections neurons have divergent connectional features. J. Comp.

There were major differences in the distribution of cells pro- jecting to the caudal and rostral parts of area 8. The majority (53%) of labeled cortical cells projecting to caudal regions were in visual association areas, and an additional 23% were in the ventral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, where neurons may have predominantly visual and visuomotor properties. In contrast, rostral area 8 had a much lower percentage of its cortical input originating in visual association areas (5%) or in the ventral bank ofthe intraparietal sulcus (8%). After HRP injection in this rostral part, 21% of labeled cells were in auditory association areas and 13% in paralimbic regions, whereas labeling in these two types of cortex was negligible after HRP administration to caudal parts of area 8. The percentage of cells in other association regions (portions of the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, dorsolateral parietal, medial parietal, and prefrontal cortices) was higher in the rostral (53%) than in the caudal case (21%). The results suggest that caudal area 8 may be involved in head and eye movements in response to visual stimuli, while its anterior subdivisions may be involved in directing the head and eyes in response to auditory stimuli. Furthermore, limbic input may also be relevant to the neural processing occurring in rostral frontal eye fields, perhaps by directing attention toward motivationally relevant stimuli.",,

In contrast, different receptors had remarkably coincidental distributions in the motor cortex. In this area, they all tended to concentrate in layers I, II and the upper part of layer III. However, such coextensive distribution of many types of neurotransmitter receptors is not observed in motor cortex of rats and humans and therefore may be a distinctive feature of motor cortex in the rhesus monkey.

Its synapses dominate the inputs to relay cells and to the GABAergic cells of the reticular nucleus; its organization in focused and diffuse projections promotes both coherent activity of relay neurons and the spread of activity across the cortex and thalamus. The capacity of relay neurons to operate in voltage-dependent tonic or burst mode permits corticothalamic inputs to directly excite the relay cells or indirectly inhibit them via the reticular nucleus. This enables the corticothalamic projection to synchronize high- or low-frequency oscillatory activity, respectively, in the thalamo–corticothalamic network. Differences in the subunit composition of AMPA receptors at synapses formed by branches of the same corticothalamic axon in the reticular nucleus and dorsal thalamus are an important element in the capacity of the cortex to synchronize low-frequency oscillations in the network. Intrinsic voltage-gated calcium channels of different kinds expressed in the relay neurons form a substrate for corticothalamic interactions with the relay cells that promote high- or low-frequency oscillations. Focused corticothalamic axons arising from layer VI cortical cells and diffuse corticothalamic axons arising from layer V cortical cells, in conjunction with the core and matrix cells of the dorsal thalamus, form a substrate for synchronization of widespread populations of cortical and thalamic cells during high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events.",,

II. Comparative aspects of connections with the thalamus, corpus striatum, and related forebrain nuclei","The supplementary eye field (SEF) was defined electrophysiologically in behaving monkeys to study its connections with the diencephalon and corpus striatum. The specificity of SEF pathways was determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry to compare its connections with those of the arcuate frontal eye field (FEF), contiguous dorsocaudal area 6 (6DC), and primary motor cortex (M1, arm/hand region). Results indicate that patterns of SEF connectivity were similar to the FEF and markedly different from areas GDC and Ml. Primary reciprocal thalamic pathways of the SEF were with the magnocellular ventral anterior (VA) nucleus, medial parvicellular VA, medial area X, and paralaminar medialis dorsalis (multi-formis and parvicellularis). FEF showed similar connections but its most robust pathway was with MD rather than VA. In contrast, area 6DC showed the most extensive reciprocal connections with lateral VApc and lateral area X with only sparse connections with paralaminar MD. Area 6DC also exhibited reciprocal connections with the ventral lateral (VL) complex and the ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo). M1 showed dense bidirectional connections with VPLo, and to a lesser extent, with VL. M1 pathways with the medial dorsal nucleus were negligible. All areas exhibited connections with the paracentral and central lateral nuclei and only M1 lacked connections with the central superior lateral nucleus. SEF and FEF exhibited similar efferent projections to the caudate and putamen. In the caudate, terminal fields were restricted to a central longitudinal core while those from area 6DC were more widely distributed.

In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine (1) The areal distribution of MD projections, (2) the layer (s) in which MD afferents terminate, (3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, (4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and (5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA. In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the inferior parietal lobule, the superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior part of the insula after injections that involved the medial part of MD. Labeled terminals were invariably confined to layer IV and adjacent deep layer III. No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the cerebral cortex following injections confined to any part of MD. The projection from MD to the PFC formed a disjunctive pattern of bands ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 mm, which were especially evident when injections were relatively small; when the injection involved a larger thalamic volume, the pattern of terminal labeling was somewhat more diffuse and tangentially extensive throughout layers III and IV. These data may indicate an interdigitation of the terminal fields originating from adjacent clusters of thalamic cells (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino: J. Comp. Neurol. 242:535–560, '85). Analysis of retrograde transport in the PFC, SMA and AC revealed unexpected regional differences in the laminar origin of corticothalamic cells. In all prefrontal areas, labeled corticothalamic neurons were found mainly in the superficial part of layer VI with a few labeled cells situated also in the superficial part of layer V. In the supplementary motor area the distribution of cells was essentially bilaminar with the number of labeled cells in superficial V much more substantial than in PFC. Finally, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the labeled cells were confined to and stratified in layer VI with about equal density in its superficial and deep strata. Regional differences were also apparent in relationships of retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminal fields. In prefrontal areas, fluctuations in the density of labeled cells paralleled changes in terminal field density. The anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex, however, contained high concentrations of labeled neurons but only sparse terminal label, indicating that the mediodorsal nucleus may have a different anatomical relationship with its “essential” target than with its “accessory” or “secondary” targets.",,

Of the nine axons that were recorded intracellularly, those with projections to layer 4C beta (two axons) and to layer 1 (one axon) had color-selective properties, whereas those (six axons) which arborized in 4C alpha all had transient, broad band and highly contrast-sensitive receptive fields. These properties are consistent with derivations from somata in the parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN, respectively. Afferents to 4C alpha were found to cover approximately 6 times as much surface area as afferents to 4C beta. The preterminal trunks of all axons were found to follow tortuous paths through the neuropil--paths that may derive from axon segregation during development. The wide ranging, patchy distributions of single afferents in 4C alpha suggest that individual 4C alpha axons supply more than one ocular dominance stripe. In one case where the terminal arborization of a 4C alpha axon was mapped against the transneuronally determined pattern of ocular dominance, three separate patches of terminal boutons were indeed found to coincide with the bands of one eye.",,

The most adaptive object choices yield the food of higher value. A large body of data identifies the amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex (PFo) as neural mediators of adaptive responses to reinforcer devaluation. More recent work in nonhuman primates reveals the critical role of the medial, magnocellular portion of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MDm) as well. Because both the nucleus accumbens (NA) and the MDm are anatomically related to the amygdala and PFo, and because both regions are implicated in reward processing, we tested whether either region necessarily interacts with the amygdala and PFo to mediate reinforcer devaluation effects. We used a crossed-disconnection design in which monkeys received amygdala and PFo lesions in one hemisphere combined with either NA or MDm lesions in the contralateral hemisphere. Monkeys that sustained NA disconnection, like controls, showed robust shifts in object choices in response to reinforcer devaluation. In contrast, monkeys that sustained MDm disconnection failed to adjust their object choices. Thus, MDm, but not NA, works together with the amygdala and PFo to support reward-based decision making.",,

Some animals were administered colchicine intracerebroventricularly prior to sacrifice to enhance the visualization of perikaryal immunoreactivity. Immunoreactive perikarya are localized to hypothalamic infundibular nucleus, giving rise to several distinct projections. Rostral projections extend through midline diencephalic and preoptic areas, and enter the telencephalon. Along this course, immunoreactive fibers are seen in midline hypothalamic and preoptic nuclei, nucleus of the diagonal band, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septum, and other limbic structures in telencephalon. Caudal to the anterior commissure, some fibers ascend dorsally to enter the midline thalamus, which they innervate. Lateral projections of the infundibular perikarya course through the medial-basal hypothalamus, dorsal to the optic tracts, and enter the amygdala region where they innervate more medially situated amygdaloid nuclei. Caudal projections of the POMC neurons also extend through midline diencephalon, some coursing along a periventricular path to innervate midline hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei. This projection extends into the mesencephalic substantia grisea centralis and may also contribute to the innervation of more dorsally situated nuclei in the pons and medulla, such as the parabrachial nuclei and nucleus tractus solitarius. Other caudal projections originating in the hypothalamus course through the ventral tegmentum of mesencephalon and pons and may contribute to the innervation of midline raphe and other ventrally situated nuclei in the pons and medulla. The distribution of immunoreactive perikarya and fibers in the brain of rhesus monkey is strikingly similar to that found in the rat brain.

However, little is known about these connections in human brain. We attempted to identify and investigate the anatomical characteristics of the thalamocortical connection between MD and PFC in human brain using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Thirty-two healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. Diffusion tensor images were scanned using a 1.5-T. A seed region of interest was placed at the MD of the thalamus on coronal images, and target regions of interest were placed on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively. The three thalamocortical connections found were reconstructed using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) software. The three thalamocortical connections were arranged in subcortical white matter in the following order from upper to lower levels: the DLPFC, the VLPFC, and the OFC. In terms of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values, no significant differences were observed between the DLPFC, VLPFC and OFC (p>0.05). In contrast, the OFC tract volume was higher than those of the DLPFC and the VLPFC (p<0.05). Three thalamocortical connections were reconstructed between MD and PFCs in human brain using DTT. We believe that the results of this study would be helpful to clinicians in treating frontal network syndrome and psychiatric diseases.","Prefrontal cortex, mediodorsal nucleus, thalamus, diffusion tensor imaging",

Cerebral walls processed with Nissl, Golgi, electron-microscopic, and histochemical methods show that this zone consists of migratory and postmigratory neurons, growth cones, loosely arranged axons, dendrites, synapses, and glial cells. In both species the subplate zone becomes visible at the beginning of the mid-third of gestation as a cell-poor/fiber-rich layer situated between the intermediate zone and the developing cortical plate. The subplate zone appears earlier in the somatosensory than in the visual area and reaches maximal width at the beginning of the last third of gestation in both regions. At the peak of its size the ratio between the width of the subplate zone and cortical plate in the somatosensory cortex is 2:1 in monkey and 4:1 in man while in the occipital lobe these structures have about equal width in both species. The dissolution of the subplate zone begins during the last third of gestation with degeneration of some subplate neurons and the relocation of fiber terminals into the cortex. The subplate zone disappears faster in the visual than in the somatosensory area. The present results together with our previous findings support the hypothesis that the subplate zone may serve as a “waiting” compartment for transient cellular interactions and a substrate for competition, segregation, and growth of afferents originated sequentially from the brain stem, basal forebrain, thalamus, and from the ipsi- and contralateral cerebral hemisphere. After a variable and partially overlapping time period, these fibers enter the cortical plate while the subplate zone disappears leaving only a vestige of cells scattered throughout the subcortical white matter. A comparison between species indicates that the size and duration of the subplate zone increases during mammalian evolution and culminates in human fetuses concomitantly with an enlargement of cortico-cortical fiber systems. The regional difference in the size, pattern, and resolution of the subplate zone correlates also with the pattern of cerebral convolutions. Our findings indicate that, contrary to prevailing notions, the subplate may not be a vestige of the phylogenetically old network but a transient embryonic structure that expanded during evolution to subserve the increasing number of its connections.",,

More recently, subcortical structures such as cerebellum and basal ganglia have been implicated in cognitive functions as well. The fact that subcortico-cortical circuits for the control of movement involve the thalamus prompts the notion that activity in movement-related thalamus may also reflect elements of cognitive behavior. Yet this hypothesis has rarely been investigated. Using the pathways linking cerebellum to cerebral cortex via the thalamus as a template, we review evidence that the motor thalamus, together with movement-related central thalamus have the requisite connectivity and activity to mediate cognitive aspects of movement control.","motor thalamus, central thalamus, thalamus, cognition, cerebellum, timing, executive control, language",

Results showed that NC, including lateral reticular formation (LRF), projects to contralateral VPM, the VPM-VPL border and medial VPL, and a region dorsal to ventroposterior nucleus (VP) proper which contains cells larger than those in VPM yet which stain as darkly as VPL neurons; this latter zone of termination may be homologous with VPLo (Vim) in other species, which is that area receiving lemniscal and cerebellar afferents (Mehler, '71; Walsh and Ebner, '73; Boivie, '74). In addition, a small projection is noted in an area intercalated between dorsomedial MG, limitans nucleus and posterior VP which closely agrees with the medial division of Posterior nucleus (Po) described in rhesus and squirrel monkey (Burton and Jones, '76). No terminations were observed in the gustatory nucleus medial to VPM. Bilateral, terminal projection fields were observed in posterior mediodorsal nucleus (MD), and a paralaminar area (PL) which lies in the ventrolateral strip of MD and is particularly prominent in primates; other bilateral fields were noted in CL, particularly the more medial segment of the nucleus. A sparse projection was noted in contralateral CM. Ipsilateral, intratrigeminal connections between NC and main sensory nucleus (MSV) also were observed. We conclude that, in the squirrel monkey, NC efferents, probably including LRF, may be considered analagous to the spinothalamic system by virtue of terminations in older medial and newer ventroposterior thalamus. Terminations in posterior MD may be specific to Primates. Moreover, projections to an area just dorsal to VP proper in squirrel monkey may be included within the broader definition of a neo-spinothalamic area as reflected in spinothalamic tract projections to the ventrolateral complex in cat (Boivie, '71b; Jones and Burton, '74). The small NC projection to a part of Po is consistent with spinothalamic terminations to a “posterior” thalamic area in other primates (Mehler, '69), and with the suggestion that medial Po transmits pain information (Burton and Jones, '76).",,

The retrograde transport of HRP resulted in the labeling of neurons in diverse cortical and subcortical areas. In cortex, labeled neurons were noted in prefrontal cortex (areas 8, 45, 46), in the banks of the intraparietal and superior temporal sulci, in medial parietal cortex, in cingulate cortex, in the retrosplenial area, in area TF and the caudal portions of the parahippocampal region. Subcortical sites with labeled neurons included the nucleus basalis of the substantia innominata, the claustrum, the pulvinar and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the pretectal area, the nucleus locus coeruleus and the raphe nuclei. Although many of the labeled neurons were seen in layers IIIc and V, each cortical area had an individual laminar pattern of labeled neurons. In these experiments, a benzidine dihydrochloride (BDHC) method was used which yields a blue reaction-product at sites containing HRP. BDHC affords superior visibility of labeled neurons, and a significant improvement in sensitivity when compared to a diaminobenzidine procedure in matching series of sections. Additional sections were also stained with a method which allows the simultaneous demonstration of HRP (blue) and acetylcholinesterase (reddish-brown). These revealed that virtually all substantia innominata (nucleus basalis) neurons which project to area PG are also rich in the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. These afferents of PG may be classified into ‘sensory association’, ‘limbic’ and ‘reticular’ categories. It is argued that this arrangement of afferent input may afford a convergence of limbic and sensory information in area PG and that this may subserve a significant function in the process of sensory attention.",,

The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so-called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.1) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incdrta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields. The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to. area 7a. These two populations of Pul.m. neurons occupy partially overlapping zones so that after large dye injections into both the parietal and frontal lobes there are label-free spaces between the sidklike neuronal aggregates. However, although they overlap, it is evident from double labeling experiments with distinct retrogradely transportedflourescent dyes that the two populations of cortically projecting neurons are essentially separate.",,

All neurons were located in the ventrobasal complex and responded to non-noxious stimuli. Each neuron was composed of dendrites that varied considerably in size and each dendrite tended to occupy a particular region of the perisomatic space with minimal overlap with other dendrites. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dendritic arbors of the labeled neurons showed they had an asymmetric distribution so that some regions of the perisomatic space contained more of the dendritic tree than others. Eleven of the thirteen reconstructed neurons had a larger percentage of the dendritic tree projecting into the medial portion of the perisomatic space. These results show that the dendritic arbors of macaque TCP neurons are not organized in a radially symmetric pattern as previously described and the asymmetric distribution of dendrites may be related to synaptic input.,Thalamus; Dendrite; Electrophysiology; Intracellular filling; Somatosensory system;,

AM projects to nearly the entire rostrocaudal extent of limbic cortex and to visual cortex. Anteriorly, AM projects to medial orbital, frontal polar, precentral agranular, and infraradiata cortices. Posteriorly, AM projects to retrosplenial granular, entorhinal, perirhinal and presubicular cortices, and to the subiculum. Further, AM projects to visual cortical area 18b, and to the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. AM projections are topographically organized, i.e., projections to different cortical areas arise from distinct parts of AM. The neurons projecting to rostral infraradiata cortex (IRα) are more caudally located in AM than the neurons projecting to caudal infraradiata cortex (IRβ). The neuronal cell bodies that project to the terminal field in area 18b are located primarily in ventral and lateral parts of AM, whereas neurons projecting to perirhinal cortex and amygdala are more medially located in AM. Injections into the most caudal, medial part of AM (i.e., the interanteromedial [IAM] nucleus) label terminals in the rostral precentral agranular, caudal IRβ, and caudal perirhinal cortices. Whereas most AM axons terminate in layers I and V–VI, exceptions to this pattern include area 18b (axons and terminals in layers I and IV–V), the retrosplenial granular cortex (axons and terminals in layers I and V), and the presubicular, perirhinal, and entorhinal cortices (axons and terminals predominantly in layer V).

However, the distribution and degree of axon collateralization of DLG cells which give rise to these projections are unknown. This study was designed to answer these questions. The DLG (along with the pulvinar and other subcortical regions) was examined for the presence of single- or doublelabeled cells after injections of two different (fluorescent or HRP) retrograde tracers into corresponding retinotopic points in visual cortical areas V1 and V4. In the DLG, it was found that cells projecting to V4, which reside in or near the tectorecipient interlaminar zones of the DLG, do not project to V1 and thus represent a separate population of cells. The organization of the macaque geniculo-prestriate projection thus seems quite different from that of carnivores. Both single- and double-labeled cells were found in other subcortical areas, e.g., single-labeled cells were found in the claustrum, hypothalamus and lateral pulvinar, and a double-labeled cell population was found in the inferior pulvinar.",,

We discuss the role of the infralimbic cortex (IL) in visceromotor control and the prelimbic cortex (PL) in cognition and their interactions in goal-directed behaviors in the rat. The PL strongly interconnects with a relatively small group of structures that, like PL, subserve cognition, and together have been designated the ‘PL circuit.’ These structures primarily include the hippocampus, insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, the mediodorsal and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus and the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain. Lesions of each of these structures, like those of PL, produce deficits in delayed response tasks and memory. The PL (and ventral anterior cingulate cortex) (AC) of rats is ideally positioned to integrate current and past information, including its affective qualities, and act on it through its projections to the ventral striatum/ventral pallidum. We further discuss the role of nucleus reuniens of thalamus as a major interface between the mPFC and the hippocampus, and as a prominent source of afferent limbic information to the mPFC and hippocampus. We suggest that the IL of rats is functionally homologous to the orbitomedial cortex of primates and the prelimbic (and ventral AC) cortex to the lateral/dorsolateral cortex of primates, and that the IL/PL complex of rats exerts significant control over emotional and cognitive aspects of goal-directed behavior.",infralimbic cortex; prelimbic cortex; nucleus reuniens; hippocampus; memory; working memory; AC; anterior cingulate cortex; ACC; nucleus accumbens; ACTH; adrenocorticotropic hormone; AGm; medial agranular (frontal) cortex; BLA; basolateral nucleus of amygdala; BST; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; CEA; central nucleus of the amygdala; DLPFC; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; EC; entorhinal cortex; FEF; frontal eye fields; HF; hippocampal formation; ICA; intercalated nucleus of the amygdala; IL; infralimbic cortex; LTD; long term depression; LTP; long term potentiation; MD; mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus; M1; primary motor cortex; mPFC; medial prefrontal cortex; NTS; nucleus of the solitary tract; OMPFC; orbitomedial prefrontal cortex; PAG; periaqueductal gray; PFC; prefrontal cortex; PHA-L; Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; PL; prelimbic cortex; PPF; paired pulse facilitation; PT; paratenial nucleus; PV; paraventricular nucleus; RAM; radial arm maze; RE; nucleus reuniens of thalamus; SNc; substantia nigra-pars compacta; VTA; ventral tegmental area; WM; working memory;,

The thalamus also receives inputs from basal ganglia nuclei (BG) involved in value-based decision making, suggesting a role in the value process. We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning. Our data indicate that single neurons in the posterior thalamus not only processed simple visual information but also represented historical values. Furthermore, our data suggest a SC-posterior thalamus-BG-SC subcortical loop circuit that encodes the historical value, enabling a quick automatic gaze by bypassing the visual cortex.",,

This area has been considered to participate in the control of complex forelimb movements in a way different from the SMA. In an attempt to analyze the patterns of projections from the pre-SMA to the basal ganglia, we examined the distributions of pre-SMA inputs in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus and compared them with the SMA input distributions. To detect morphologically the terminal fields from the pre-SMA and the forelimb region of the SMA, anterograde tracers were injected into such areas that had been identified electrophysiologically in the macaque monkey. Corticostriatal inputs from the pre-SMA were distributed mainly in the striatal cell bridges connecting the rostral aspects of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, as well as in their neighboring striatal portions. These input zones were located, with no substantial overlap, rostral to corticostriatal input zones from the SMA forelimb region. Corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA were almost localized in the medial aspect of the nucleus, where corticosubthalamic inputs from the SMA forelimb region were also distributed predominantly. However, the major terminal fields from the pre-SMA were centered ventrally to those from the SMA. The present results indicate that the corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA appear to be segregated from the SMA-derived input zones. This implies the possibility of parallel processing of motor information from the pre-SMA and SMA in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.",Basal ganglia; Striatum; Subthalamic nucleus; Presupplementary motor area; Supplementary motor area; Motor control;,

Cortical connections of the caudal superior temporal plane in macaque monkeys","The caudal medial auditory area (CM) has anatomical and physiological features consistent with its role as a first-stage (or “belt”) auditory association cortex. It is also a site of multisensory convergence, with robust somatosensory and auditory responses. In this study, we investigated the cerebral cortical sources of somatosensory and auditory inputs to CM by injecting retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. A companion paper describes the thalamic connections of CM (Hackett et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [this issue]). The likely cortical sources of somatosensory input to CM were the adjacent retroinsular cortex (area Ri) and granular insula (Ig). In addition, CM had reliable connections with areas Tpt and TPO, which are sites of multisensory integration. CM also had topographic connections with other auditory areas. As expected, connections with adjacent caudal auditory areas were stronger than connections with rostral areas. Surprisingly, the connections with the core were concentrated along its medial side, suggesting that there may be a medial-lateral division of function within the core. Additional injections into caudal lateral auditory area (CL) and Tpt showed similar connections with Ri, Ig, and TPO. In contrast to CM injections, these lateral injections had inputs from parietal area 7a and had a preferential connection with the lateral (gyral) part of Tpt. Taken together, the findings indicate that CM may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the fundus of the lateral sulcus. The differential connections of CM compared with adjacent areas provide additional evidence for the functional specialization of the individual auditory belt areas. J. Comp.

We have recorded single-neuron activities from the MD nucleus in monkeys trained to perform spatial tasks with peripheral visual stimuli and a nonspatial task with foveally presented pictures of objects and faces—tasks identical to those we have previously used to map regional specializations in the dorso- and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. We found that MD neurons exhibited categorical specificity—either responding selectively to locations in the spatial tasks or preferentially to specific representations of faces and objects in the nonspatial task. Spatially tuned neurons were located in parts of the MD connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while neurons responding to the identity of stimuli mainly occupied more ventral positions in the nucleus that has its connections with the inferior prefrontal convexity. Neuronal responses to auditory stimuli were also examined, and vocalization sensitive neurons were found in more posterior portions of the MD. We conclude that MD neurons are dissociable by their spatial and nonspatial coding properties in line with their cortical connections and that the principle of information segregation in cortico-cortical pathways extends to the “association” nuclei of the thalamus.",,

Several cortical areas known to be involved in this process exchange projections with the dorsal aspect of the thalamic pulvinar nucleus, suggesting that this structure may play a central role in visuomotor behavior. Here, we used reversible inactivation to investigate the role of the dorsal pulvinar in the selection and execution of visually guided manual and saccadic eye movements in macaque monkeys. We found that unilateral pulvinar inactivation resulted in a spatial neglect syndrome accompanied by visuomotor deficits including optic ataxia during visually guided limb movements. Monkeys were severely disrupted in their visually guided behavior regarding space contralateral to the side of the injection in several domains, including the following: (1) target selection in both manual and oculomotor tasks, (2) limb usage in a manual retrieval task, and (3) spontaneous visual exploration. In addition, saccades into the ipsilesional field had abnormally short latencies and tended to overshoot their mark. None of the deficits could be explained by a visual field defect or primary motor deficit. These findings highlight the importance of the dorsal aspect of the pulvinar nucleus as a critical hub for spatial attention and selection of visually guided actions.",,

These data have been interpreted to mean that projections from MDmc to prefrontal cortex are required to sustain normal prefrontal function in a variety of task settings. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the MDmc impair a preoperatively learnt strategy implementation task that is impaired by a crossed lesion technique that disconnects the frontal cortex in one hemisphere from the contralateral inferotemporal cortex. Postoperative memory impairments were also examined using the object-in-place scene memory task. Monkeys learnt both strategy implementation and scene memory tasks separately to a stable level preoperatively. Bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the MDmc, produced by 10 × 1 μl injections of a mixture of ibotenate and NMDA did not affect performance in the strategy implementation task. However, new learning of object-in-place scene memory was substantially impaired. These results provide new evidence about the role of the magnocellular mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in memory processing, indicating that interconnections with the prefrontal cortex are essential during new learning, but are not required when implementing a preoperatively acquired strategy task. Thus, not all functions of the prefrontal cortex require MDmc input. Instead, the involvement of MDmc in prefrontal function may be limited to situations in which new learning must occur.","mediodorsal thalamus, strategy, episodic memory, amnesia, monkey, prefrontal cortex",

In this way, prosimian primates, close relatives of simian primates, and tree shrews differ markedly from monkeys in which S-II is deactivated by comparable ablations, and resemble such mammals as cats and rabbits in which S-II also remains highly responsive following ablations in S-I. Thus, it appears that the generalized mammalian condition is that S-I and S-II are independently activated via parallel thalamocortical pathways. A dependence of S-II on serial connections from the thalamus to the S-I region and then to S-II apparently evolved with the advent of anthropoid primates, and may be present only in monkeys and perhaps other higher primates.",,

When injected HRP is confined to the FOR, retrogradely labeled cells appear in lobules VIc and VII of the ipsilateral vermis and in group b of the contralateral medial accessory olive (MAO). In reference to the maps of topographical organization, the extent of the effective site in the fastigial nucleus (FN) could be assessed from the distributions of labeled Purkinje cells (P cells) in the vermis and labeled olivary neurons in the MAO. In contrast to the unilateral nature of the P-cell and climbing-fiber projections, those from the other brainstem regions to the FOR were bilateral. Following the injection of HRP into the FOR, the largest number of retrogradely labeled cells appeared in the pontine nuclei. Although the number of labeled cells was greater on the contralateral side in both the peduncular and dorsomedial pontine nuclei (DMPN), the number on each side was virtually identical in the dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN). In the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis(NRTP), labeled cells were located only in its medial and dorsolateral portions bilaterally. In the vestibular complex, labeled cells appeared in the superior (SVN), medial (MVN), and inferior vestibular nuclei (IVN) bilaterally. The lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN), including y group and the ventrolateral vestibular nucleus, were free of labeled cells. Labeled cells appeared also in the perihypoglossal nucleus (PHN) bilaterally. In the pontine raphe (PR) and paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), labeled cells appeared bilaterally in the caudal third of the area between the oculomotor and abducens nuclei. Labeled cells appeared also in the mesencephalic and medullary reticular formation. Tracing of anterogradely labeled axons demonstrated that most fibers from the FOR decussated within the cerebellum and entered the brainstem via the contralateral uncinate fasciculus. Some crossed fibers ascended with the contralateral brachium conjunctivum and terminated in the midbrain tegmentum. A small contingent of fibers advanced further to the thalamus. In the mesodiencephalic junction, labeled terminals were found contralaterally in the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) and a medial portion of Forel's H Field. They appeared also in the central mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF), the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the posterior commissure nucleus, and the superior colliculus. The oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, the red nucleus, and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal were free of labeled terminals. The projections from the FOR to the vestibular complex were bilateral and were mainly to the ventral portions of the LVN and IVN. The ipsilateral fibers emerged with the juxtarestiform body. The PHN, the SVN, and the MVN were free of terminals. Crossed fibers arising from the FOR terminated in a caudal portion of the PR, the PPRF, the DMPN, the NRTP, and the dorsomedial portion of the medullary reticular formation (DMRF). Labeled terminals in the DMRF were also found on the ipsilateral side, although the contralateral side was predominant. When the HRP injection involved a fastigial area rostral to the FOR, labeled terminals appeared also in the PHN, SVN, MVN, and DLPN of the contralateral side.",,

The large mediodorsal thalamic nucleus predominantly connects with the prefrontal cortex, the adjacent intralaminar nuclei connect with fronto-parietal cortex, and the midline thalamic nuclei connect with medial prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe. Taking into account this connectivity pattern, it is not surprising that the intralaminar and medial thalamus has been implicated in a variety of cognitive functions, including memory processing, attention and orienting, as well as reward-based behavior. This review addresses how the intralaminar and medial thalamus may regulate information transmission in cortical circuits. A key neural mechanism may involve intralaminar and medial thalamic neurons modulating the degree of synchrony between different groups of cortical neurons according to behavioral demands. Such a thalamic-mediated synchronization mechanism may give rise to large-scale integration of information across multiple cortical circuits, consequently influencing the level of arousal and consciousness. Overall, the growing evidence supports a general role for the higher-order thalamus in the control of cortical information transmission and cognitive processing.","neural synchrony, memory, attention, reward, schizophrenia, anesthesia, reuniens nucleus, mediodorsal nucleus",

Results confirm the projection to pons from parasensory association areas in the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and extend these observations to include the posterior parahippocampal gyrus. The findings reveal that the white matter of the posterior limb of the internal capsule above the midpoint of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and at the medical aspect of the lateral geniculate nucleus, comprise common regions through which these corticopontine fibers lead to the basis pontis. The fibers demonstrate a certain degree of topographic organization in the posterior limb of the capsule above the lateral geniculate nucleus and also in the cerebral peduncle. Taken together with previous observations concerning the termination patterns of these associative corticopontine projections, it would appear that the corticopontine system consists of segregated and partially overlapping pathways, which are to some extent distinguishable anatomically at each stage of their trajectory from origin to destination. Furthermore, the existence of a common area through which all parasensory associative input to pons is transmitted suggests that a precisely located lesion in this part of the corticopontocerebellar circuit may disrupt the cerebellar access to higher order information derived from the parasensory associative regions. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Calretinin immunoreactivity was weak in the geniculate bodies and in nuclei of the ventral and posterior groups, moderate in the reticular nucleus and in nuclei of the anterior, medial, and lateral groups, and strong in nuclei of the midline group and anterior intralaminar nuclei. The mediodorsal nucleus was unique among thalamic nuclei because it contained a wide variety of intensely immunostained perikarya embedded in a moderately-labelled neuropil. The reticular nucleus displayed several small and uniformly distributed neuronal clusters composed of immunostained perikarya lying in a moderately-labelled neuropil. Intense and uniform immunostaining was observed in all midline nuclei and in the anterior intralaminar nuclei, including the paracentral and central lateral nuclei. These nuclei, which harboured numerous intensely-stained perikarya lying in a dense immunoreactive neuropil, were the most strongly-immunoreactive structures of the entire human thalamus. At the level of the posterior intralaminar nuclei, the central median nucleus was virtually free of immunostaining whereas the parafascicular nucleus was moderately labelled. The nucleus submedius located just beneath the central median/parafascicular complex displayed a very intense calretinin immunostaining. This study has provided evidence for the presence of the protein calretinin in the human thalamus. The pattern of distribution of calretinin, as delineated in the present study, suggests that this calcium-binding protein may participate in various subcortical and cortical thalamic systems involved in the modulation of emotional and motivational states.","calcium-binding proteins; human thalamus; thalamic functions; midline thalamic nuclei; intralaminar thalamic nuclei; AD, anterodorsal nucleus; AV, anteroventral nucleus; CeM, central medial nucleus; CL, central lateral nucleus; CM, central median nucleus; dLG, dorsal lateral geniculate body; H, habenula; IR, immunoreactive; LD, lateral dorsal nucleus; Li, nucleus limitans; LP, lateral posterior nucleus; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; MG, medial geniculate body; MV, medioventral nucleus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, paracentral nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; Pg, perigeniculate nucleus; Pl, pulvinar; Pla, anterior pulvinar nucleus; Pli, inferior pulvinar nucleus; Pll, lateral pulvinar nucleus; Plm, medial pulvinar nucleus; Pv, paraventricular nucleus; Re, reuniens nucleus; SbM, submedius nucleus; SG, suprageniculate nucleus; VA, ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc, magnocellular ventral anterior nucleus; VL, ventral lateral nucleus; VLa, ventral lateral anterior nucleus; VLp, ventral lateral posterior nucleus; VM, ventral medial nucleus; VP, ventral posterior nucleus; VPi, ventral posterior inferior nucleus; VPl, ventral posterior lateral nucleus; VPm, ventral posterior medial nucleus; ZI, zona incerta;",

Three reciprocal pathways were found in Macaca; they were between striate cortex and (i) all layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; (ii) the inferior subdivision of pulvinar; and (iii) the lateral subdivision of pulvinar. In Saimiri the only recprocal pathway involved the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; the pulvinar received a heavy striate input but too few peroxidase-labeled neurons were found in pulvinar to demonstrate convincingly a projection to striate cortex. In both species the reticular and posterior nucleus of the thalamus and the superior colliculus receive striate input; in Saimiri the ventral lateral geniculate also receives a striate projection. In both species, neurons in the basal forebrain project to striate cortex. Striate cortex synaptic terminals in both dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar are topographically organized. Inferior and lateral subdivisions of pulvinar each contain a representation of central retina, and the fiber bundles separating the two subdivisions apparently mark the vertical meridian. The results of this experiment suggest that both retino-geniculate and retino-superior colliculus-pulvinar types of visual information may converge within the striate cortex.",,

The frontal eye field also projects to the ipsilateral pretectal nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, superior colliculus (especially layer four), zona incerta, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, nucleus Darkschewitsch, dorsomedial parvocellular red nucleus, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, basilar pontine nuclei, and bilaterally to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Many of these structures also receive input from deeper layers of the superior colliculus and are known to participate in visuomotor function. These results (1) reveal connections that account for the parallel influence of the superior colliculus and the frontal eye field on visuomotor function; (2) suggest that there has been little evolutionary change in subcortical connections, and therefore function, of the frontal eye fields since the time that these lines of primates diverged; and (3) support the conclusion that the frontal eye fields are homologous in New and Old World monkeys.",,

All thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey displayed 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers, but none contained immunopositive cell bodies. The 5-HT innervation of the thalamus derived from extrinsic fibers arising mostly from the midbrain raphe nuclei and forming the transtegmental system. Most of the fibers destined to the thalamus collected into a major bundle that swept dorsoventrally within the midbrain tegmentum and coursed beneath the thalamus along its entire caudorostral extent. Several fiber fascicles broke off from this main bundle at different levels and ascended dorsally to innervate the various thalamic nuclei. Overall, the 5-HT innervation of the thalamus in the squirrel monkey was more massive than would have been expected from earlier studies in nonprimate species. Marked differences in the regional density of innervation were noted both between the various nuclei and within single nuclei. The most densely innervated nuclei were those delineating the principal subdivisions of the thalamic mass, that is, the midline, rostral intralaminar, limitans, and reticular nuclei, where very dense fields of isolated axonal varicosities occurred. In contrast to the rostral intralaminar nuclei, which were rather uniformly innervated, the centre médian/parafascicular complex contained immunoreactive fibers and isolated varicosities distributed according to a mediolateral gradient. The habenula and the ventral anterior nucleus were among the most weakly innervated nuclei. In the latter nucleus, as well as in more densely innervated nuclei, thin varicose fibers formed numerous pericellular contacts on cell bodies and proximal dendrites of thalamic neurons. The 5-HT innervation of the lateral nuclear group as well as that of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei ranged from very weak to dense. The mediodorsal nucleus displayed a highly heterogeneous 5-HT innervation that varied from weak in its central portion to moderate or dense in its medial and lateral borders. A moderate 5-HT innervation was observed in the anterior nuclear group. The surprisingly dense and heterogeneous 5-HT innervation of the thalamus noted in the present study suggests that serotonin may be involved in several specific functions of the thalamus in primates.",,

TC neurons in these nuclei have a striking point-to-point topography and a stereotyped laminar pattern of termination in the cortex, which has made them ideal models to study the organization, plasticity, and development of TC circuits. However, despite their experimental importance, neurons within these nuclei only represent a fraction of all thalamic neurons and do not reflect the diversity of the TC neuron population. Here we review the distinct subtypes of projection neurons that populate the thalamus, both within and across anatomically-defined nuclei, with regard to differences in their morphology, input/output connectivity and target specificity, as well as more recent findings on their neuron type-specific gene expression and development. We argue that a detailed understanding of the biology of TC neurons is critical to understand the role of the thalamus in normal and pathological perception, voluntary movement, cognition and attention.",,

To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Methods: Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation during thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Results: Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusions: A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients.",Thalamus; primate; neurodevelopment; neuromorphometry; schizophrenia; MRI;,

We tested this in awake Macaca fascicularis by stimulating between pairs of electrodes inserted into GPi under electrophysiological control and recording the responses evoked in thalamic neurons. HFS produced a reduction, not an increase, in discharge frequency during the stimulus train in 77% of the responsive thalamic neurons. Only 16% of the responsive cells showed an increase in discharge during stimulation and, for some of these, stimulation at a similar intensity produced contralateral muscle contraction, a probable sign of current spread to the internal capsule. The few thalamic neurons studied during bursting had a reduction in burst frequency and duration during HFS. We conclude that high-frequency stimulation within GPi does not necessarily facilitate thalamic discharge, and it may act, instead, to interrupt abnormal patterns of thalamic discharge associated with parkinsonian symptoms.",,

DCS is defined as the main region in which axons from ipsilateral medial agranular cortex (AGm) terminate within the striatum. In this double-labeling study, we placed a green axonal tracer in area AGm and a red one in an additional brain region. We examined the spatial relationship between terminals from area AGm and other portions of the cortical–basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical network involved in directed attention and its dysfunction, hemispatial neglect, in the rat. These include lateral agranular cortex (AGl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO), and secondary visual cortex (Oc2M). One important finding is the presence of a dense focus of labeled axons within DCS after injections in cortical area PPC or Oc2M. In these foci, axons from PPC or Oc2M extensively overlap and interdigitate with axons from cortical area AGm. Additionally, retrograde labeling of striatal neurons, along with double anterograde labeling, suggests that axons from cortical area AGm and AGl cross and possibly make contact with the dendritic processes of single medium spiny neurons. Axons from thalamic nucleus LP were observed to form a dense band dorsal to DCS which is similar to that seen following PPC injections, and a significant number of LP axons were also observed within DCS. Projections from thalamic nucleus VL are present in the dense dorsolateral AGm band that abuts the external capsule, are densest in the dorsolateral striatum, and were not observed in DCS. These results extend previous findings that DCS receives input from diverse cortical areas and thalamic nuclei which are themselves interconnected.",,

Differences in cortical maps present a formidable problem in comparing data across studies and in constructing databanks on the connections and functional attributes of cortical areas. Here we used quantitative approaches to cortical mapping to investigate (i) if architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex in adult rhesus monkeys have unique profiles and (ii) if groups of architectonic areas belonging to distinct cortical types, ranging from agranular to eulaminate, have similar features. In addition, we used multidimensional analyses to see if, and how, prefrontal areas form clusters when multiple features are considered simultaneously. We used quantitative unbiased sampling procedures to estimate the areal and laminar density of neurons, glia and neurons positive for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR) among 21 prefrontal areas or subdivisions of areas. Neuronal density varied among the prefrontal cortices (range: 38 569 ± 4078 to 58 708 ± 2327 neurons/mm3); it was lowest in caudal orbitofrontal and medial areas (OPAll, OPro, 13, 24a, 32, M25) and highest in lateral prefrontal areas (subdivisions of areas 46 and 8). Neurons positive for PV were most prevalent in lateral prefrontal areas and least prevalent in caudal orbitofrontal and medial pre-frontal areas, whereas the opposite trend was noted for neurons that expressed CB. Neurons positive for CR did not show regional differences, and the density of glia showed small variations among prefrontal cortices. The differences among areas, along with differences in the thickness of individual areas and layers, were used to establish a quantitative profile for each area. The results showed that differences in the density of neurons, and the preponderance of neurons positive for PV and CB, were related to different architectonic types of areas found within the prefrontal cortex. Conventional as well as multiparameter statistical analyses distinguished at one extreme the agranular and dysgranular (limbic) cortices, which were characterized by prominent deep layers (V–VI), the lowest neuronal density, the highest ratio of glia/neurons, and the lowest density of PV and the highest for CB. At the other extreme, lateral eulaminate cortices were characterized by the highest density of neurons, a prominent granular layer IV, denser supragranular (II–III) than infragranular (V–VI) layers, and a balanced distribution of neurons positive for PV and CB. The results provide insights into potentially different rates of development or maturation of limbic and eulaminate prefrontal areas, and their differential vulnerability in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The quantitative methods used provide an objective approach to construct maps, address differences in nomenclature across studies, establish homologies in different species and provide a baseline to identify changes in pathologic conditions.",,

Orbitofrontal cortices participate in olfactory functions, but the pathways through which they receive olfactory or other input have not been clearly defined. The retrograde tracers horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes were injected in orbital cortices to study their afferent cortical connections. Labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas (prepiriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle) were directed mainly to a posterior orbitofrontal region and to a lesser extent the neighboring caudal part of area 13. There was no evidence of direct projections from primary olfactory areas to the rostral parts of area 13, or to areas 12 or 11. Most labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas were directed to agranular cortices, fewer projected to dysgranular areas, and there was no evidence that any reached granular cortices. The areas which received the most robust olfactory projections showed the lowest degree of laminar organization among prefrontal cortices. Early processing in the olfactory system thus takes place in areas which differ sharply on structural grounds from “early” eulaminate post-Rolandic sensory cortices. In addition to olfactory cortical projections, numerous labeled neurons in transitional (limbic) cortices were directed to orbital areas, and fewer but still substantial numbers of afferent neurons were found in eulaminate cortices. Unlike post-Rolandic unimodal sensory areas, which seem to be committed to the processing of input from one sensory modality via sequential and/or parallel pathways, caudal orbital areas received highly distributed input from primary olfactory areas, and in addition, from gustatory, visual, auditory and somatosensory areas. The structural and connectional features of olfactory recipient orbital cortices thus differ markedly from those observed in other sensory association areas and suggest a mode of processing adapted early in cortical evolution.",AChE; acetylcholinesterase; DMSO; dimethylsulfoxide; HRP-WGA; horseradish peroxidase-wheatgerm agglutinin; PAH; periallocortex; Pro; proisocortex;,

The results were compared with those of the accompanying paper in which the ganglion cells projecting to the midbrain are selectively revealed. Two major classes of ganglion cells are described, the Pα and Pβ cells. For both classes dendritic field size increases with eccentricity from the fovea and there is no overlap in the two classes at any given eccentricity. Cell body size shows a similar mean difference but with a slight overlap. Both cell bodies and dendritic fields are larger along the temporal horizontal meridian than the nasal horizontal meridian, for Pα and for Pβ cells, but these differences are reduced when naso-temporal differences in ganglion cell density are taken into account, that is, size correlates closely with density. Injections restricted to the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus labelled almost exclusively Pβ cells, whereas injections confined to the magnocellular layers labelled almost exclusively Pα cells. As midbrain injections label no Pβ cells and few Pα cells it can be shown that about 80% of ganglion cells are Pβ cells projecting to parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus, and that about 10% are Pα cells projecting to magnocellular layers. The coverage factor, that is the number of cells covering each point on the retina, varied from 1.9–2.3 for Pβ cells, and from 2–7 for Pα cells. Comparing the results with those of comparable investigations on cats and rabbits shows a much clearer segregation of the terminal targets of different classes of ganglion cell in monkeys, the greatest difference being the absence in the monkey of a projection to the geniculate from gamma- and epsilon-like cells. Further, axons which branch and innervate both thalamus and midbrain are rare in monkeys but common in other mammals. Comparing the results with those from physiological investigations suggests that the Pβ cells correspond to colour-opponent cells, whereas Pα cells correspond to the achromatic broad-band magnocellular cells.",dLGN; dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; HRP; horseradish peroxidase;,

Located in the dorsal midline thalamus, the Pa is heavily innervated by serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine (DA), corticotropin-releasing hormone, and orexins (ORX), and is the only thalamic nucleus connected to the group of structures comprising the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and infralimbic/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). These neurotransmitter systems and structures are involved in regulating motivation and mood, and display abnormal functioning in several psychiatric disorders including anxiety, substance use, and major depressive disorders (MDD). Furthermore, rodent studies show that the Pa is consistently and potently activated following a variety of stressors and has a unique role in regulating responses to chronic stressors. These observations provide a compelling rationale for investigating the Pa in the link between stress and negative emotional behavior, and for including the Pa in the neural pathways of stress-related psychiatric disorders.","paraventricular, thalamus, subgenual, stress, anxiety, addiction, depression, orexin",

Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011) showed that distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was coregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The 3D dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.","brain imaging, cerebellar and basal ganglia-thalamic connections, human thalamic nomenclature, MNI space, stereotactic maps, VIM",

Using bipolar stimulation of the cortical surface, 113 thalamic neurones were successfully identified as antidromically driven from the hand area of the postcentral gyrus (48 neurones) or from the hand area of the precentral gyrus (65 neurones). All but one of these 113 neurones could only be antidromically discharged from the postcentral cortex or from the precentral cortex, and not from both. Most had antidromic latencies between 0.5 and 1.5 ms. Twenty-five/sixty-five precentrally projecting neurones and 45/48 postcentrally projecting neurones were activated by stimulation of the contralateral median or radial nerves. Both groups responded at short latency (4–8 ms) and many were activated by low-threshold shocks (0.8–1.3 T) and had restricted receptive fields on the hand. Precentrally projecting neurones responded most powerfully to joint movement or deep pressure, and some of these neurones were also responsive to cutaneous stimuli. Precentrally projecting neurones with peripheral inputs were all found in the oral subdivision of the VPL (the VPLo). The properties of these neurones suggest that they may be partly responsible for rapid somatosensory input to the motor cortex.",,

Thalamic neurons which receive inhibition from the pallidum were found to project to the motor cortex (area 4) as well as to premotor cortex. The neurons with pallidal input and motor cortical projection were located mainly in VLo. This result indicates that the basal ganglia innervate the motor cortex through the thalamus. Thus the basal ganglia can modify the cortical output for controlling movements directly through this pathway as compared with its influence through the prefrontal and premotor cortices.,,

In recordings made from 3,120 single neurons, a secondary cortical taste area was found in the caudolateral part of the orbitofrontal cortex of the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. The area is part of the dysgranular field of the orbitofrontal cortex and is situated anterior to the primary cortical taste areas in the frontal opercular and adjoining insular cortices. 2. The responses of 49 single neurons with gustatory responses in the caudolateral orbitofrontal taste cortex were analyzed using the taste stimuli glucose, NaCl, HCl, quinine HCl, water, and blackcurrant juice. 3. A breadth-of-tuning coefficient was calculated for each neuron. This is a metric that can range from 0.0 for a neuron that responds specifically to only one of the four basic taste stimuli to 1.0 for one that responds equally to all four stimuli. The mean coefficient for 49 cells in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex was 0.39. This tuning is much sharper than that of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the monkey, and sharper than that of neurons in the primary frontal opercular and insular taste cortices. 4. A cluster analysis showed that at least seven different groups of neurons were present. For each of the taste stimuli glucose, blackcurrant juice, NaCl, and water, there was one group of neurons that responded much more to that tastant than to the other tastants. The other groups of neurons responded to two or more of these tastants, such as glucose and blackcurrant juice. In this particular region neurons were not found with large responses to HCl or quinine HCl, although such neurons could be present in other parts of the orbitofrontal cortex. 5. On the basis of this and other evidence it is concluded that in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex there is a secondary cortical taste area in which the tuning of neurons has become finer than in early areas of taste processing, in which foods, water, and NaCl are strongly represented and where motivation dependence first becomes manifest in the taste system.",,

In this contribution the thalamus is regarded as an important place of interaction between the input and the output organization of the basal ganglia. In support of this idea, a brief overview is provided of some of the most recent findings concerning the thalamus in relation to the basal ganglia circuitry. In particular, we have focused on the thalamostriatal projections themselves, on the output of the basal ganglia to the thalamus and also on the overlapping territories between the thalamic projection of the output nuclei and the thalamostriatal neurons. These data support the existence of several thalamic feedback circuits within the basal ganglia neural system. Finally, some considerations are provided upon the functional significance of these thalamic feedback circuits in the overall organization of the basal ganglia.",Thalamus; Basal ganglia; Striatum; Globus pallidus; Substantia nigra; Rat; Cat; Monkey;,

The term “nonspecific” has been dismissed, but it has left behind a great deal of confusion and the embarrassing impression that the nonspecific thalamus has not found a satisfactory anatomical identity. This chapter reviews the midline thalamic region, which is part of this complex territory. It aims to define the midline thalamus as a collection of cell groups whose structural features and circuits differ greatly from those of adjacent structures and from all other portions of the “nonspecific” thalamus. The chapter discusses midline in relation to the intralaminar thalamus because these two regions have been unified historically in the same entity, and they are still often considered as a single group. This is due to the common belief that midline and intralaminar nuclei share functional features, based on their preferential innervation from the brain stem core and their robust connections with the basal ganglia.",,

While there is some overlap the general arrangement of the thalamofrontal projection has been established as follows: (1) the intermediate area of the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus, extending obliquely throughout the entire length of the nucleus, projects to the most rostral portion of the prefrontal cortex; (2) the posterolateral portion of the mediodorsal nucleus projects to the proreal gyrus and the caudal part of the orbital gyrus; (3) the antero-medial portion of the nucleus sends projection fibers to the subproreal gyrus and a greater part of the orbital gyrus; (4) the anterodorsal portion of the nucleus projects to the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex.",,

Although it is suggested that this pathway is affected in schizophrenia, there is a lack of functional and structural data regarding its synaptic organization. The scope of this study was to characterize the ultrastructural features of thalamocortical synapses formed by afferents from the MD by applying anterograde tract tracing, immunohistochemical detection of parvalbumin (PV, a probable marker of thalamocortical endings), and quantitative electron microscopic techniques to the PFC of the macaque monkey. Our findings indicate that anterogradely-labeled and PV-immunoreactive boutons exhibit similar ultrastructural properties, characterized by their larger size, higher incidence of release sites and a higher occurrence of mitochondria when compared to non-labeled, excitatory-like endings in the middle layers of the PFC. Although most of the contacts were made on spines in both cases, PV-immunopositive axon terminals apparently targeted dendritic shafts at about twice the frequency found for anterogradely-labeled afferents from the MD (20.5% and 9.5%, respectively). This result suggests diversity among thalamocortical and/or PV-immunoreactive axon terminals of the PFC. In accordance with studies in other cortical areas, our findings suggest that corollary discharge through the mediodorsal thalamocortical projection is also adapted to synaptic transmission with high efficacy and probably exhibits marked short-term temporal dynamics in the PFC.",,

Pifl, S. J. Kish and O. Hornykiewicz Mov Disord. 27, 2012, 1618.]. As this noradrenaline loss was especially severe in nuclei of the motor thalamus normally transmitting basal ganglia motor output to the cortex, we hypothesized that this noradrenaline loss aggravates the motor disorder of Parkinson's disease. Here, we analysed noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin in motor (ventrolateral and ventroanterior) and non-motor (mediodorsal, centromedian, ventroposterior lateral and reticular) thalamic nuclei in MPTP-treated monkeys who were always asymptomatic; who recovered from mild parkinsonism; and monkeys with stable, either moderate or severe parkinsonism. We found that only the symptomatic parkinsonian animals had significant noradrenaline losses specifically in the motor thalamus, with the ventroanterior motor nucleus being affected only in the severe parkinsonian animals. In contrast, the striatal dopamine loss was identical in both the mild and severe symptom groups. MPTP-treatment had no significant effect on noradrenaline in non-motor thalamic nuclei or dopamine and serotonin in any thalamic subregion. We conclude that in the MPTP primate model, loss of noradrenaline in the motor thalamus may also contribute to the clinical expression of the parkinsonian motor disorder, corroborating experimentally our hypothesis on the role of thalamic noradrenaline deficit in Parkinson's disease.",,

AGRP is transcribed primarily in the adrenal and hypothalamus and is a high affinity antagonist of the neural melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors. The perikarya expressing AGRP messenger RNA are found in the arcuate nucleus of the rat and rhesus monkey. Using a polyclonal antibody against the pharmacologically active domain of AGRP (amino acids 83–132), we have also characterized the distribution of AGRP-immunoreactive neurons in both species. The major fiber tracts are conserved in both species, with dense projections originating in the arcuate nucleus and proceeding along the third ventricle. Dense fiber bundles are also visible in the paraventricular, dorsomedial, and posterior nuclei in the hypothalamus, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and in the lateral septal nucleus of the septal region. AGRP-containing neurons are not visualized in a number of areas, including portions of the amygdala, thalamus, and brain stem, that express MC3-R and MC4-R messenger RNA and receive innervation from POMC neurons that serve as the source of melanocortin agonists. Thus, AGRP is most likely to be involved in modulating a conserved subset of the physiological functions of central melanocortin peptides. Based on the particular distribution of AGRP neurons, those functions are likely to include the central control of energy homeostasis.",,

The illustrations are based on photographs of unstained frozen sections of three formalin-fixed brains in which stainless steel needles were inserted to mark the horizontal zero and several anteroposterior positions. The sections were not stained in order to prevent shrinkage. Stereotaxic measurements were taken in situ of the highest points on the cortical surface, the position of the central and lunate sulcus, and of certain landmarks at the base of the cranium in a large number of monkeys. These data along with brain dimensions and the weight of animals are displayed in tables to indicate individual variations and to aid investigators in determining the best stereotaxic coordinates for a given structure.

Anteroposterior sectors of the SI cortex are represented in the thalamic ventrobasal complex by curved lamellae of thalamocortical relay cells extending through the dorso-ventral and anteroposterior dimensions of the ventrobasal complex. Within such a lamella there are clustered aggregations of cells each projecting to a punctate zone of SI. Such cortical zones are less than 1 mm in circumference and are interpreted as comparable to the “columns” of electrophysiological studies. Each clustered aggregation in the ventrobasal complex is of limited mediolateral and dorsoventral extent but extends through much of the anteroposterior dimension of the ventrobasal complex. Punctate zones lying adjacent to one another in the mediolateral dimension of the SI cortex are connected with aggregations of cells lying in adjacent lamellae of the ventrobasal complex. Punctate zones lying anterior or posterior to one another in the anteroposterior dimension of SI are connected with aggregations of cells lying ventral or dorsal to one another in a lamella of the ventrobasal complex. Sectors of SI extending from posterior to anterior across areas 2 and 1 and others extending from posterior to anterior across area 3b, are each represented systematically across the full dorsal to ventral dimension of the ventrobasal complex. This implies at least two separate representations of the body surface: one in areas 2 and 1, and another in area 3b. Within a lamella of the ventrobasal complex, aggregations of cells projecting to areas 2 and 1 are mingled with those projecting to area 3b. Measurements of the sizes of retrogradely labeled cells in brains in which areas 2 and 1 or area 3b were separately injected showed no distinction between cells projecting to the three areas on the basis of size. Experiments combining retrograde cell degeneration due to ablation of area 3b with retrograde labeling after injection of areas 1 and 2 indicated little possibility of collateral projections to the three areas from the same cell. No part of SI, as defined by the most liberal anatomical criteria, is connected with any thalamic nucleus outside the confines of the ventrobasal complex (the caudal division of the ventroposterolateral nucleus and the large-celled part of the ventroposteromedial nucleus) or of the intralaminar complex. Area 3a, as traditionally defined, has connectional relationships that strongly suggest it is a part of the motor cortex, area 4. However, short latency Group I evoked potentials could be elicited from a small part of area 3a lacking layer V giant cells and lying adjacent to area 3b. This part receives its thalamic input from the ventrobasal complex. The data indicate that area 4 is connected with the oral division of the ventroposterolateral nucleus and with the caudal nucleus of the ventral lateral complex. These cellular groupings, however, are only artificially separated and appear to form part of the same thalamic relay nucleus. Experiments on area 5 not only suggest that the posterior boundary of SI should be placed further posterior than is customary, but also suggest that area 5 can be divided into an anterior field related to the anterior nucleus of the pulvinar and a posterior field related to the lateral posterior nucleus.",,

Numerically, its synapses dominate the inputs to relay cells and to the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic cells of the reticular nucleus (RTN). The capacity of relay neurons to operate in different voltage-dependent functional modes determines that the inputs from the cortex have the capacity directly to excite the relay cells, or indirectly to inhibit them via the RTN, serving to synchronize high- or low-frequency oscillatory activity respectively in the thalamocorticothalamic network. Differences in the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subunit composition of receptors at synapses formed by branches of the same corticothalamic axon in the RTN and dorsal thalamus are an important element in the capacity of the cortex to synchronize low-frequency oscillations in the network. Interactions of focused corticothalamic axons arising from layer VI cortical cells and diffuse corticothalamic axons arising from layer V cortical cells, with the specifically projecting core relay cells and diffusely projecting matrix cells of the dorsal thalamus, form a substrate for synchronization of widespread populations of cortical and thalamic cells during high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events.",,

This study compared the effect of pre- and posttraining bilateral lesions of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus with those of the amygdala on contextual conditioned fear. Both pre- and posttraining amygdala lesions almost eliminated conditioned freezing, and significantly blocked postshock freezing when behavioral tests were performed immediately after footshocks, reconfirming previous studies that the amygdala is implicated in the learning of Pavlovian conditioning. Both pre- and posttraining lesions of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus significantly attenuated conditioned freezing but had no effect on postshock freezing. In contrast to lesions of the amygdala, those of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus failed to alter the increased defecation induced by conditioned fear stress. Our results suggest that the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus has an important role in acquisition, consolidation or retrieval in Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning. Possible neural circuits, incorporating the amygdala, MD, and hippocampus, and the functional similarity of the MD and hippocampus in contextual fear conditioning, are also discussed.",,

The injections were placed in the forelimb and eye-movement representations of PMD and in the forelimb representation of PMV as determined by microstimulation mapping. For comparison, injections were also placed in the forelimb representation of primary motor cortex (M1) of two owl monkeys. The results indicate that both PMD and PMV receive dense projections from the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus, and sparser projections from the ventromedial (VM), mediodorsal (MD) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. Labeled neurons in VL were concentrated in the anterior (VLa) and the medial (VLx) nuclei, with only a few labeled cells in the dorsal (VLd) and posterior (VLp) nuclei. In VA, labeled neurons were concentrated in the parvocellular division (VApc) dorsomedial to VLa. Labeled neurons in MD were concentrated in the most lateral and posterior parts of the nucleus. VApc projected more densely to PMD than PMV, especially to rostral PMD, whereas caudal PMD received stronger projections from neurons in VLx and VLa. VLd projected exclusively to PMD, and not to PMV. In addition, neurons labeled by PMD injections tended to be more dorsal in VL, IL, and MD than those labeled by PMV injections. The results indicate that both premotor areas receive indirect inputs from the cerebellum (via VLx, VLd and IL) and globus pallidus (via VLa, VApc, and MD). Comparisons of thalamic projections to premotor and M1 indicate that both regions receive strong projections from VLx and VLa, with the populations of cells projecting to M1 located more laterally in these nuclei. VApc, VLd, and MD project mainly to premotor areas, while VLp projects mainly to M1. Overall, the thalamic connectivity patterns of premotor cortex in New World owl monkeys are similar to those reported for Old World monkeys.","motor thalamus; ventral lateral nucleus; motor cortex; primate; frontal cortex; AChE; acetylcholinesterase; CL; central lateral nucleus; CM; centromedian nucleus; CO; cytochrome oxidase; DY; Diamidino Yellow; FB; Fast Blue; FR; fluororuby; ICMS; intracortical microstimulation; IL; intralaminar nuclei; MD; medial dorsal nucleus; M1; primary motor area; M1c; primary motor area, caudal subdivision; M1r; primary motor area, rostral subdivision; Pc; paracentral nucleus; PMD; dorsal premotor cortex; PMDc; dorsal premotor cortex, caudal subdivision; PMDr; dorsal premotor cortex, rostral subdivision; PMV; ventral premotor cortex; PMVc; ventral premotor cortex, caudal subdivision; PMVr; ventral premotor cortex, rostral subdivision; SMA; supplementary motor area; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc; ventral anterior nucleus, medial (magnocellular) subdivision; VApc; ventral anterior nucleus, lateral (parvocellular) subdivision; VL; ventral lateral nucleus; VLa; ventral lateral nucleus, anterior subdivision; VLd; ventral lateral nucleus, dorsal subdivision; VLp; ventral lateral nucleus, principal subdivision; VLx; ventral lateral nucleus, medial subdivision; VM; ventral medial nucleus; WGA-HRP; wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase;",

In this study the architectonic structure of the OMPFC was analyzed with nine histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in 32 individuals of three macaque species. The stains included Nissl, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, Timm, and selenide stains and immunohistochemical stains for parvalbumin, calbindin, a nonphosphorylated neurofilament epitope (with the SMI-32 antibody), and a membrane-bound glycoprotein (with the 8b3 antibody). In addition to patterns of cell bodies and myelinated fibers, these techniques allow the visualization of markers related to metabolism, synapses, and neurotransmitters. A cortical area was defined as distinct if it was differentiated in at least three different stains and, as described in later papers, possessed a distinct set of connections. Twenty-two areas were recognized in the OMPFC. Walker's areas 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 [J. Comp. Neurol. (1940) 73:59–86] have been subdivided into areas 10m, 10o, 11m, 11l, 12r, 12l, 12m, 12o, 13m, 13l, 13a, 13b, 14r, and 14c. On the medial wall, areas 32, 25, and 24a, b, c have been delineated, in addition to area 10m. The agranular insula also has been recognized to extend onto the posterior orbital surface and has been subdivided into medial, intermediate, lateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral agranular insula areas. The OMPFC, therefore, resembles other areas of primate cortex, such as the posterior parietal and temporal cortices, where a large number of relatively small, structurally and connectionally distinct areas have been recognized. Just as the area-specific neurophysiological properties of these parietotemporal areas underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis, it is likely that the many small areas of the OMPFC also make differential contributions to the general mnemonic, sensory, and affective functions of this region. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The anterior thalamus is a part of extended hippocampal system and its significance for learning and memory processes is well known. Although our knowledge about a specific role of this brain structure has increased in recent years considerably, this is the first attempt to summarize neurochemical diversity of the anterior thalamus. The following groups of bioactive substances are reviewed: (1) classical neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate and aspartate, acetylcholine, serotonin) and their receptors, (2) calcium-binding proteins (calretinin, calbindin, parvalbumin), and (3) others (cocaine- and amphetamine regulated transcript, enkephalins, substance P). In order to extend our knowledge concerning exact functions of selected neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the studied brain structure, the future studies should concentrate on potential alterations in the neurochemical profile during various pathological states which affect the anterior thalamic nuclei.",,

The traditional ventroposterior medial (VPM) and ventroposterior lateral (VPL) subnuclei were easily identified, as well as the forelimb and hindlimb compartments of VPL, as they were separated by poorly staining, cell-poor septa. Septa also separated other cell groups within VPM and VPL, specifically in the medial compartment of VPL representing the hand (hand VPL). In one squirrel monkey and one galago we demonstrated that these five groups of cells represent digits 1–5 in a mediolateral sequence by injecting tracers into the cortical representation of single digits, defined by microelectrode recordings, and relating concentrations of labeled neurons to specific cell groups in hand VPL. The results establish the existence of septa that isolate the representation of the five digits in VPL of primates and demonstrate that the isolated cell groups represent digits 1–5 in a mediolateral sequence. The present results show that the septa are especially prominent in brain sections processed for vGluT2, which is expressed in the synaptic terminals of excitatory neurons in most nuclei of the brainstem and thalamus. As vGluT2 is expressed in the synaptic terminations from dorsal columns and trigeminal brainstem nuclei, the effectiveness of vGluT2 preparations in revealing septa in VP likely reflects a lack of synapses using glutamate in the septa.

In penetrations made into the upper bank of the lateral sulcus in two monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cells were isolated from the second somatosensory cortex (SII). During single-cell recordings, animals performed an active touch task in which they rubbed their fingertips over pairs of gratings differing in groove width and indicated which was the smoother surface. Hand motion and downward applied force were measured and recorded during these strokes. 2. In this survey, 151 penetrations provided observations on 352 cells that responded to passive stimulation of the digits or during performance of the active touch task. Consistent with previous reports, receptive fields (RFs) in SII were large, often multi-digit, and frequently included a portion or all of the hand and occasionally the arm. Modality was determined for 92 of 127 fully characterized cells, and included 70 cutaneous, 5 deep, 11 Pacinian corpuscle, and 6 joint cells. Characteristic of SII, modality could not be defined in 35 cells that were unresponsive to passive stimulation or whose responses varied widely over time. 3. Response properties of a subgroup of 79 cells in SII resembled those previously studied in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) using identical procedures. Correlation analysis revealed that 29 of these cells, like a portion of cells in SI, responded to changes in groove width independent of force or velocity. This selectivity could be considered a form of feature specificity. 4. In contrast to SI and VPL, transient responses to the fingertips contacting small elevated metal bars, which demarcated the beginning, middle, and end of strokes across the gratings, were seen in a majority of SII cells (109/127). During contact with bars, 89 cells displayed excitatory responses and 20 cells showed suppressed activity. Twelve cells, which responded to bars in isolation from gratings, provided a possible example of increased stimulus selectivity. 5. Passive stimulation failed to activate 16 cells that responded, in some cases differentially to gratings or force, during the task. Responses of nine other cells demonstrated task-dependent modulation in the form of response reduction or enhancement during selected portions of the stroke. In these same cells, response changes did not occur under comparable stimulus conditions in other portions of the stroke that differed only in behavioral context. These types of selective response modulations, not noted in our previous studies of VPL or SI, suggest that mechanisms regulating sensory inputs may affect SII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

The relationship between this cortical region and medial pulvinar was found to be topographical. The cells of origin for the afferents to cortex lying between the superior limb of arcuate sulcus and principal sulcus were located in two bands; one ventral and one dorsal in the nucleus. Cells with projections sulcus were found in a band situated midway between the ventral and dorsal limits of medial pulvinar. Most of the labeled cells in medial pulvinar were located in the anterior two-thirds of the nucleus. No afferents from other pulvinar nuclei to this region were noted. A small number of labeled cells in oral pulvinar resulted from injections of the tracer in premotor area. Injections in pre- and postcentral gyri and prefrontal cortex outside of arcuate sulcus did not result in labeled neurons in pulvinar. A discussion of these findings in light of earlier anatomical investigations of cortex within the arcuate sulcus and pulvinar follows a detailed description of the methods used and the results.",,

Here we demonstrate using electrophysiological techniques that the rostral portion of the rat VPL nucleus (rVPL, −2 to −2.5 mm bregma) carries a large amount of proprioceptive information. Caudal to this region is a zone where the cutaneous receptive fields are focal (mVPL for middle VPL, −2.5 to −3.2 mm bregma) with a fine topographic map of the fore- and hindlimbs. The forepaw is represented with digit 1 medial and each subsequent digit increasingly lateral, all of which are dorsal to the pads. The caudal VPL (cVPL, −3.2 to −4.0 mm bregma) has broad receptive fields and is the target of lamina 1 and lamina 2, as well as the dorsal column nuclei, and may represent the flow of nociceptive information through the VPL. Thus we propose that the VPL may be thought of as three subnuclei—the rostral, middle, and caudal VPL—each carrying preferentially a different modality of information. This pattern of information flow through the rat VPL is similar, although apparently rotated, to that of many primates, indicating that these regions in the rat (rVPL, mVPL, and cVPL) have become further differentiated in primates where they are seen as separate nuclei (VPS, VPL, and VPI/VMpo).",,

Although the topographic organization of V4’s connections with other cortical areas has been established, the detailed topography of its connections with subcortical areas is unclear. We therefore injected retrograde and anterograde tracers in different topographical regions of V4 in nine macaques to determine the organization of its subcortical connections. The injection sites included representations ranging from the fovea to far peripheral eccentricities in both the upper and lower visual fields. The topographically organized connections of V4 included bidirectional connections with four subdivisions of the pulvinar, two subdivisions of the claustrum, and the interlaminar portions of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and efferent projections to the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and the caudate nucleus.

The brain of a macaque was used as a reference for the cytoarchitectonic study of the complex. Three parts were isolated: the pars parafascicularis (or medial part), the pars media (or middle part) and the pars paralateralis (or lateral part).Wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was stereotaxically injected into either the sensorimotor or the associative territory of the striatum (i.e. the striatal space occupied by the axonal endings coming from either the sensorimotor or the associative cortex) of four macaques. Neurons projecting to the sensorimotor territory of the striatum were found to be located within the pars media (middle part) of the central complex while neurons projecting to the associative territory of the striatum were located within the pars parafascicularis. In all experimental cases, labelled neurons were scarce or absent in the pars paralateralis (or lateral part). Outside the central complex, neurons projecting to the sensorimotor territory of the striatum were scattered within the lateral part of the lateral mass, in the intralaminar nuclei and in the posterior part of the internal lamina. Neurons projecting to the associative territory of the striatum were observed mainly in the paraventricular region, dorsal to the rostral part of the lateral mass, and in the dorsolateral part of the nucleus oralis medialis.

The hippocampal inputs to the amygdala arose from the subicular and entorhinal cortices and passed through the angular bundle to terminate principally in the medial basal and lateral basal nuclei, with lighter termination in the lateral nucleus, the periamygdaloid cortex, and the cortical-transition area. The majority of these amygdaloid inputs arose from the rostral hippocampal formation although there was equivocal evidence of an additional projection from the caudal hippocampus to the central nucleus. Projections arose from many of the amygdaloid nuclei to terminate in the molecular layer of the amygdalo-hippocampal area and the adjacent stratum moleculare of the uncal portion of the hippocampus. The accessory basal, lateral basal, and medial basal nuclei also projected to the most rostral portions of the stratum moleculare of fields CA1–3, the heaviest termination occurring in field CA3. Additional projections from the basal nuclei terminated in the prosubiculum, presubiculum, and para-subiculum. The heaviest entorhinal inputs arose from the accessory basal and lateral nuclei and terminated in layers I, II, and III of areas 28b, 28i, and the prorhinal cortex.

The role of the gustatory thalamus in taste-guided behavior. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 22(6) 883–902, 1998. Gustatory thalamus is the functional name for the parvicellular region of the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. It is the penultimate nucleus in the thalamocortical pathway of the central gustatory system. Early research encouraged the view that the gustatory thalamus was important for taste detection and recognition. Consistent with this analysis, lesions of the area were found to induce profound deficits of innate taste preferences and aversions, salt appetite, and conditioned taste aversions (CTAs). More recent research using discrete lesions placed with electrophysiological guidance has, however, demonstrated that these deficits were due to damage to structures outside of, rather than within, the boundaries of the gustatory thalamus. In fact, the new data show that the gustatory thalamus is not essential for taste detection, sodium appetite, or CTA learning, but is critical for the preparatory (i.e. food-seeking) rather than the consummatory (i.e. food-eating) aspects of taste-guided behavior.",Gustatory thalamus; Brain lesions; Taste; Salt appetite; Conditioned taste aversion; Autoshaping; Gustatory contrast; Consummatory behavior; Preparatory behavior; Rat;,

In two awake, juvenile male Macaca fascicularis monkeys, microstimulation was applied in ventralis anterior (VA), ventralis lateralis (VL), or ventralis posterior lateralis (VPL) of the thalamus. Thalamic recording was used to identify the region that contained pallidal-receiving (PR) thalamic neurons, cells that responded orthodromically to stimulation in the internal pallidal segment (GPi). Thalamic stimulation was used to elicit motor responses. Penetrations in the thalamus and the pallidum focused on areas with activity related to contralateral arm movement. Fifty-one PR cells were identified electrophysiologically in VL oralis (VLo), VL caudalis (VLc) and VA pars parvocellularis (VApc). 2. With a subject at rest, trains of stimuli were applied through the thalamic microelectrode. Palpable or visible muscle twitches or joint movements were evoked by short trains (12 pulses) of stimuli applied in VLc and VPL oralis (VPLo); thresholds there ranged from 5 to 75 microA. In VA and VLo, areas where PR neurons were located, even longer trains (24 pulses) of stimuli with currents up to 200 microA usually failed to evoke movement. In the caudal portions of VLo, near VPLo, there were some microexcitable sites found near PR cells where stimuli at approximately 50 microA elicited movement. 3. From microstimulation studies combined with histological reconstruction, Ashe and co-workers hypothesized that microexcitable zones were cerebellar receiving areas (CR) and nonexcitable zones were PR areas. Our data support theirs and add electrophysiological identification of PR areas. Further, we injected wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the thalamus at one of the more rostral microexcitable sites, just caudal and lateral to identified PR cells. The tetra-methyl benzidine-reacted HRP label was found in the contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but not in ipsilateral GPi, showing that even this rostral microexcitable zone was a CR area. 4. Together with evidence from the literature, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that PR cells have relatively weak access to spinal-destined motor outputs, whereas thalamocortical neurons from VPLo and VLc have more secure access. In addition to characteristics of cell discharge and responses to somatosensory stimulation, microexcitability may be a further aid in tentative electro-physiological identification of PR versus CR areas of the motor thalamus without necessarily recording thalamic neuronal responses to stimulation in GPi or the DCN.",,

The results indicate that, contrary to previous reports which had suggested a projection to only the head of the caudate nucleus, area 9 of Brodmann projects to the entire length of the nucleus. In the head of the caudate nucleus the cortico-caudate fibers are distributed in a pattern which is remarkable in two respects. First, the grains are not uniformly distributed but rather are segregated into clusters separated from one another by territories in which grain density does not exceed background. Second, individual clusters of grains, circular or elliptical in shape, surround grain free cores. These patterns of fiber distribution within the head of the nucleus are more sharply defined in newborn than in older monkeys. Our findings suggest that the caudate nucleus is organized more as an anatomic and functional mosaic than as the homogeneously organized structure that it is commonly considered to be.",,

It is therefore surprising that this ability is impaired by medial temporal lobe (MTL) resections, because such lesions spare working memory in other sensory modalities. To determine whether MTL ablations might have caused the auditory deficit through inadvertent transection of superior temporal gyrus (STG) projections to its downstream targets, and, if so, which targets might have been compromised, we injected anterograde tracer (biotinylated dextran amine) in the STG of both the normal and MTL-lesioned hemispheres of split-brain monkeys. Interhemispheric comparison of label failed to show any effect of the MTL ablation on efferents from caudal STG, which projects to the inferior prefrontal convexity. However, the ablation did consistently interrupt the normally dense projections from rostral STG to both the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and medial thalamic nuclei. The findings support the possibility that the auditory working memory deficit after MTL ablation is due to transection of downstream auditory projections, and indicate that the candidate structures for mediating auditory working memory are the ventral medial prefrontal cortical areas, the medial thalamus, or both.","auditory cortex, auditory memory, disconnection, frontal cortex, Macaca mulatta",

LGN responses are largely low-pass in spatial frequency, whereas the majority of V1 neurons have bandpass characteristics. To study this transformation in spatial selectivity, we measured the dynamics of spatial frequency tuning using a reverse correlation technique. We find that a large proportion of V1 cells show inseparable responses in spatial frequency and time. In several cases, tuning becomes more selective over the course of the response, and the preferred spatial frequency shifts from low to higher frequencies. Many responses also show suppression at low spatial frequencies, which correlates with the increases in response selectivity and the shifts of preferred spatial frequency. These results indicate that suppression plays an important role in the generation of bandpass selectivity in V1.","primate vision, striate cortex, spatial frequency tuning, response suppression, dynamic tuning, quality factor",

Infusions of lignocaine centered within VPLo caused hemiplegia during which movements of the contralateral arm rarely were performed in either task for a short period of time (∼5–30 min). When VT responses were produced, they had prolonged reaction times and movement times and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities compared with responses produced during the preinfusion baseline period. In contrast, those IG responses that were produced remained relatively normal. Infusions centered within area X never caused hemiplegia. The only deficits observed were an increase in reaction time and movement amplitude variability and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities during VT trials. Every other aspect of both the VT and IG movements remained unchanged. Infusions centered within VLo reduced the number of movements attempted during each block of trials. This did not appear to be due to hemiplegia, however, as voluntary movements easily could be elicited outside of the trained tasks. The other main deficit resulting from inactivation of VLo was an increased reaction time in the VT task. Finally, infusions centered within VApc caused IG movements to become slower and smaller in amplitude, whereas VT movements remained unchanged. Control infusions with saline did not cause any consistent deficits. This pattern of results implies that VPLo and VLo play a role in the production of movements in general regardless of the context under which they are performed. They also suggest that VPLo contributes more specifically to the execution of movements that are visually triggered and guided, whereas area X contributes specifically to the initiation of such movements. In contrast, VApc appears to play a role in the execution of movements based on internal cues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that specific subcircuits within the cerebello- and basal ganglio-thalamo-cortical systems preferentially contribute to movements based on external versus internal cues.",,

GnIH can also directly inhibit reproductive behaviors, possibly via action within the brain. Identification of the distribution of GnIH neurons and fibers may provide us with clues to how the brain controls reproductive activities of the animal. Here, we characterized the location and connectivity of GnIH neurons in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) brain. We determined the macaque GnIH precursor mRNA, and further identified a mature GnIH peptide (SGRNMEVSLVRQVLNLPQRF-NH2) by mass spectrometry combined with immunoaffinity purification. The majority of GnIH precursor mRNA-positive and GnIH-immunoreactive (GnIH-ir) cell bodies were localized in the intermediate periventricular nucleus (IPe) in the hypothalamus, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively.

We employed a triple-labeling technique in the same owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The cerebellothalamic projections were labeled with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the pallidothalamic projections were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine. The pre-SMA was identified by location and movement patterns evoked by intracortical microstimulation and injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Brain sections were processed sequentially using different chromogens to visualize all three tracers in the same section. Alternate sections were processed for Nissl cytoarchitecture or acetylcholinesterase chemoarchitecture for nuclear boundaries. The cerebellar nuclei primarily projected to posterior (VLp), medial (VLx), and dorsal (VLd) divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus; the pallidum largely projected to the anterior division (VLa) of the ventral lateral nucleus and the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). However, we also found zones of overlapping projections, as well as interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label, particularly in border regions of the VLa and VApc. Thalamic neurons labeled by pre-SMA injections occupied a wide band and were especially concentrated in the VLx and VApc, cerebellar and pallidal territories, respectively. Labeled thalamocortical neurons overlapped cerebellar inputs in the VLd and VApc and overlapped pallidal inputs in the VLa and the ventral medial nucleus.

Deposits of anterograde tracers were made in the two lateral-most subdivisions of the central complex, i.e., the middle part (or pars media) and the lateral part (or pars paralateralis). All injections avoided the pars parafascicularis. The intrastriatal distribution of labeled axonal endings was mapped in relation to the standard ventricular (CA-CP) system of coordinates. Labeled endings were observed in the major posterior and dorsal parts of the putamen (excluding its anteromedial and ventral parts) and also in a restricted ventrolateral part of the caudate nucleus. The topography of the central territory of the striatum, denned as the striatal space receiving axons from the central complex, was found to correspond exactly to that of the cortical sensorimotor territory delineated after cortical injections. The termination pattern of the central axons within the striatum was patchy. Viewed as a whole, the irregular and hazy patches formed oblique streaks, parallel one with the other. The three-dimensional reconstructions of data from transverse sections revealed that the streaks were bi-dimensional pictures of three-dimensional parasagittal layers covering the whole anteroposterior extent of the cortical sensorimotor territory of the striatum. Our work shows that the pars media of the central complex, which receives selectively pallidal afferent axons (Francois et al., '88: Brain Res. 473:181–186), is the main source of the centroputaminal projection.

Using the Northern blot analysis, we investigated the developmental changes of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the thalamus of macaque monkeys. The amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was high at embryonic day 125, and decreased at postnatal day 1. It increased again at postnatal day 8, reached its peak value at postnatal days 50–70, and then decreased gradually until postnatal year 1. We previously reported that the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the cerebral cortex decreased roughly exponentially during perinatal and postnatal periods and that it approached the asymptote by postnatal day 70 [Oishi T, Higo N, Umino Y, Matsuda K, Hayashi M (1998) Development of GAP-43 mRNA in the macaque cerebral cortex. Dev Brain Res 109:87–97]. The present findings may indicate that extensive synaptic growth of thalamic neurons continues even after that of cortical neurons has finished. We then performed in situ hybridization to investigate whether the expression level of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was different among various thalamic nuclei. In the infant thalamus (postnatal days 70–90), moderate to intense expression of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was detected in all thalamic nuclei. Quantitative analysis in the infant thalamus indicated that the expression levels were different between the nuclear groups that are defined by the origin of their afferents. The expression in the first order nuclei, which receive their primary afferent fibers from ascending pathways [Guillery RW (1995) Anatomical evidence concerning the role of the thalamus in corticocortical communication: a brief review. J Anat 187 (Pt 3):583–592], was significantly higher than that in the higher order nuclei. While moderate expression was also detected in the adult dorsal thalamus, the expression in the first order nuclei was almost the same as that in the higher order nuclei. Thus, the in situ hybridization experiments indicated that the transient postnatal increase in the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA, which was shown by the Northern blot analysis, was mainly attributed to enhanced expression in the first order nuclei during the postnatal period. This may be a molecular basis for environmentally induced modification of thalamocortical synapses.",protein kinase C; neurogranin; first order relay; higher order relay; mediodorsal nucleus; critical period plasticity; BCIP; 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; CAMKIIα; type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; E; embryonic day; GAP-43; growth-associated protein-43; G3PDH; glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase; NBT; nitroblue tetrazolium; OD; optical density; P; postnatal day; PFA; paraformaldehyde; PKC; protein kinase C; P(number)m; postnatal month (number); SSC; standard saline citrate;,

Tissue blocks from the frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and substantia nigra were dissected and total RNA was extracted. Dopamine D2 and D5 receptor DNA fragments were generated from rhesus monkey genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. To generate dopamine receptor subtype-specific cRNA probes, DNA fragments corresponding to the carboxy terminus of the rhesus monkey D1 and D2 receptor genes and to the putative transmembrane domain regions (IV–VI) of the D5 receptor gene, were subcloned into the pGEM3Z/4Z vectors. Expression of D1 receptor mRNA exhibited significant regional differences: striatum > > > cerebral cortex ≥ hippocampus ≥ lateral thalamus. D1 receptor mRNA was found in low quantities in the medial thalamus, but was not consistently expressed in the substantia nigra area. In contrast, D2 receptor mRNA was detected in all regions that were studied: striatum > > > substantia nigra > > hippocampus ≥ cerebral cortex ≥ medial thalamus ≥ lateral thalamus. D5 receptor mRNA was also expressed in all regions, with highest levels in the cerebral cortex, striatum and lateral thalamus, and moderate levels in the substantia nigra, medial thalamus and the hippocampus. The D5 receptor mRNA appears to be widely distributed in the monkey brain. Most interesting is the expression of D5 receptor mRNA in tissues of the substantia nigra area.",Dopamine D5 receptor; Dopamine D2 receptor; Dopamine D1 receptor; Distribution; Monkey brain; Ribonuclease protection assay;,

The ECNfibers terminate in a wedge-shaped zone located dorsally in the rostral half of the contralateral nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL). This zone occupies the dorsolateral corner of the forelimb division of the VPL.

In recordings made from 2,925 single neurons, a region of primary taste cortex was localized to the rostral and dorsal part of the insula of the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. The area is part of the dysgranular field of the insula and is bordered laterally by the frontal opercular taste cortex. 2. The responses of 65 single neurons with gustatory responses were analyzed in awake macaques with the use of the taste stimuli glucose, NaCl, HCl, quinine HCl (QHCl), water, and black currant juice. 3. Intensity-response functions showed that the lowest concentration in the dynamic part of the range conformed well to human thresholds for the basic taste stimuli. 4. A breadth-of-tuning coefficient was calculated for each neuron. This is a metric that can range from 0.0 for a neuron that responds specifically to only one of the four basic taste stimuli to 1.0 for one that responds equally to all four stimuli. The mean coefficient for 65 cells in the taste insula was 0.56. This tuning is sharper than that of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the monkey, and similar to that of neurons in the primary frontal opercular taste cortex. 5. A cluster analysis showed that at least six different groups of neurons were present. For each of the taste stimuli, glucose, NaCl, HCl, QHCl, water, and black currant juice, there was one group of neurons that responded much more to that tastant than to the other tastants. Other subgroups of these neurons responded to two or more of these tastants, such as glucose and black currant juice, or NaCl and QHCl. 6. On the basis of this and other evidence, it is concluded that the primary insular taste cortex, in common with the primary frontal opercular taste cortex, represents a stage of information processing in the taste system of the primate at which the tuning of neurons has become sharper than that of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, and is moving toward the fineness achieved in the secondary taste cortex in the caudolateral orbitofrontal taste cortex, where motivation-dependence first becomes manifest in the taste system.",,

A vestibulothalamocortical pathway is proposed on the basis of physiologic results (6,13,14,16,27,28,32,40). Convincing anatomic proof for a direct vestibulothalamic projection in the monkey is still missing, since Tarlov (41) found no evidence for thalamic projections in his study using the Nauta- Gygax and the Fink-Heimer techniques.

The dendrites of ganglion cells were sufficiently well-labelled to reveal their overall morphological characteristics. It was therefore possible to compare the number and form of ganglion cells projecting to the midbrain with the total population of ganglion cells as revealed by optic nerve injections, and with ganglion cells labelled by injections in the lateral geniculate nucleus. We found that not more than 10% of all retinal ganglion cells project to the superior colliculus in the macaque monkey. This percentage varies little over the retina, being about 6% of all ganglion cells near the fovea and increasing slightly with eccentricity. The superior colliculus does not receive a projection from Pβ cells and only a few Pα cells terminate there. The majority of cells which project to the superior colliculus have a small- to medium-sized cell body and sparsely branched dendritic tree. We have called them Pγ and pɛ cells by analogy with the gamma cells and epsilon cells in the cat's retina.

Few species differences were observed for either monoamine. Cortical areas 17 and 18, as well as visual areas in the temporal and parietal lobe were found to exhibit regional specialization of both 5-HT and NA innervation. Precisely at the border between areas 17 and 18, the laminar innervation patterns and density characteristic of NA fibers in area 17 (Morrison et al., '82a; Kosofsky et al., '84) shift so that layer IV of area 18 contains more fibers than layer IV of area 17, and the overall density of fibers in area 18 is higher. For 5-HT, the highly laminated patterns characteristic of area 17 (Morrison et al., '82a; Kosofsky et al., '84) also observe this cytoarchitectonic boundary. Fibers in area 18 are more evenly distributed across laminae, and the overall density of fibers decreases. The visual region of the inferotemporal cortex was found to be very lightly innervated by NA fibers and very densely innervated by 5-HT fibers. Area 7 of the parietal lobule was more densely innervated by NA fibers, and less densely innervated by 5-HT fibers, than any other visual cortical region examined. The visual thalamic nuclei exhibited even greater regional differences in the density of NA innervation. The lateral geniculate nucleus was found to be virtually devoid of NA fibers, while the pulvinar-lateral posterior complex was densely innervated. The density of 5-HT fibers was more uniform across thalamic visual nuclei. The lateral geniculate, pulvinar, and lateral posterior nuclei all exhibit a moderate to high density of immunoreactive fibers. In the mesencephalon, the superficial layers of the superior colliculus were found to be densely innervated by NA fibers, whereas 5-HT fibers were most dense in the intermediate layers. These patterns of innervation indicate that, in these primate species, functionally related visual regions share common and distinguishable densities of NA innervation. Specifically, tecto-pulvinar-juxtastriate structures are more densely innervated than geniculo-striate and inferotemporal structures. These relationships suggest that, within the visual system, NA fibers preferentially innervate the regions involved in spatial analysis and visuomotor response rather than those involved in feature extraction and pattern analysis. Although there are some examples of complementary innervation of cortical visual areas by 5-HT and NA fibers, the 5-HT innervation of visual areas at the mesencephalic, diencephalic, and telencephalic levels was of high density and exhibited less specialization than was evident for NA innervation.",,

A fundamental question is thus how the brain integrates the separate elements of an object defined by several sensory components to form a unified percept. The superior colliculus was the main model for studying multisensory integration. At the cortical level, until recently, multisensory integration appeared to be a characteristic attributed to high-level association regions. First, we describe recently observed direct cortico-cortical connections between different sensory cortical areas in the non-human primate and discuss the potential role of these connections. Then, we show that the projections between different sensory and motor cortical areas and the thalamus enabled us to highlight the existence of thalamic nuclei that, by their connections, may represent an alternative pathway for information transfer between different sensory and/or motor cortical areas. The thalamus is in position to allow a faster transfer and even an integration of information across modalities. Finally, we discuss the role of these non-specific connections regarding behavioral evidence in the monkey and recent electrophysiological evidence in the primary cortical sensory areas.","CAC; caudal auditory cortex; CL; central lateral nucleus; CM; centre median nucleus; CT; corticothalamic; FB; feedback; FF; feedforward; FSTd; dorsal fundus of the superior temporal area; FSTv; ventral fundus of the superior temporal area; IPS; intraparietal sulcus; LIP; lateral intraparietal area; LP; lateral posterior nucleus; MD; mediodorsal nucleus; MGN; medial geniculate nucleus; MT; medial temporal area; MTc; caudal part of MT; PMd; dorsal premotor cortex; PMv; ventral premotor cortex; PuL; lateral pulvinar; PuM; medial pulvinar; RAC; rostral auditory cortex; Ri; retro-insular cortex; SC; superior colliculus; STP; superior temporal plane; STS; superior temporal sulcus; TC; thalamocortical; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VIP; ventral intraparietal area; VLpd; ventral lateral posterior nucleus, dorsal division; VPL; ventral posterior lateral nucleus; Cortex; Thalamus; Connections; Audition; Vision; Touch; Motor;",

Thalamic terminations of the dorsolateral and ventral spinothalamic pathways,"The termination sites of the dorsolateral (DSTT) and ventral (VSTT) spinothalamic pathways were determined by using anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from the lumbar spinal cord in primates. One animal had no spinal cord lesion, while of two other animals, one received a midthoracic dorsolateral funiculus lesion, and the other received a midthoracic ventral quadrant lesion contralateral to the injection. The thalamic label in the animal with no spinal cord lesion was much less than the label in the two animals with spinal lesions. Moreover, in the animals with spinal lesions, HRP-labeled cells were found within the thalamus. Therefore, the remaining six animals received ipsilateral hemisections and bilateral dorsal column lesions, irrespective of the contralateral lesions. The thalamic label in the animals without contralateral lesions were assumed to represent the total spinothalamic input to the diencephalon. In these animals, label was located mainly in suprageniculate and pulvinar oralis, caudal and oral divisions of ventral posterior lateral nucleus, the lateral half of ventral posterior inferior nucleus, and zona incerta, while in the medial thalamus label was primarily in two distinct bands in medial dorsal nucleus and in the posterior dorsal protion of central lateral nucleus. Scattered lighter labeling was found in other thalamic nuclei. The pattern of terminal labeling observed in the ventral posterior lateral region was arranged in patches, while elsewhere in the thalamus a more uniform labeling pattern was observed. The thalamic label in animals with contralateral ventral quadrant lesions represented the terminations of the DSTT, while the label in animals with contralateral dorsolateral funiculus lesions represented VSTT terminations. The labeling pattern was similar between these two groups. However, there were small differences between them. These results indicate that DSTT and VSTT terminations largely overlap and innervate the lateral and medial thalamus.",,

Altogether 2,905 trigeminal single units having a receptive field in the contralateral trigeminal integument were isolated from the somatosensory part of nucleus ventralis posteromedialis, or VPM proper. Each isolated unit was tested for responses to a series of mechanical stimuli. The stimuli included brushing the skin, touch, pressure, noxious pinch, and pinpricks. The majority of VPM proper units responded with the greatest discharge frequency to gentle mechanical stimulation: either hair movement or light pressure to the trigeminal integument, but 341 units were identified as trigeminal nociceptive units. They were partitioned into two functionally defined subclasses, nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) units, but not intermingled with low-threshold mechanoreceptive (LTM) units. Both NS and WDR units were found at or near the margin of the VPM proper but not outside this nucleus. This marginal area was referred to as the shell region of the VPM proper. A total of 248 NS units was found within the shell region of the caudal third of the VPM proper. This part was called the NS zone. These units were somatotopically organized. In the rostral part of the NS zone, ophthalmic NS units having a receptive field in the contralateral ophthalmic division were located dorsolaterally, maxillary NS units occurred dorsomedially, and mandibular NS units were found ventromedially. In the caudal part of the NS zone, maxillary NS units were encountered in the dorsal shell region, whereas mandibular NS units were found in the ventromedial shell region. Ophthalmic NS units were not found in this part of the NS zone. Altogether 93 WDR units were encountered in the shell region of the VPM proper. They were confined to a narrow band approximately 300 micron wide just rostral to the NS zone. These units were somatotopically organized. Ophthalmic WDR units having a low-threshold center of the receptive field in the contralateral ophthalmic division were located dorsolaterally, maxillary WDR units were located dorsomedially, and mandibular WDR units were located ventromedially. The majority of maxillary as well as mandibular WDR units were activated by electrical stimulation of the contralateral maxillary and/or mandibular canine tooth pulp afferents.

Previous studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and those in the caudate nucleus exhibit periodic firing modulation when the animals attempt to detect a single omission of isochronous repetitive audiovisual stimuli. To understand how these subcortical signals are sent and processed through the thalamocortical pathways, we examined single-neuron activities in the central thalamus of two macaque monkeys (one female and one male). We found that three types of neurons responded to each stimulus in the sequence in the absence of movements. Reactive-type neurons showed sensory adaptation and gradually waned the transient response to each stimulus. Predictive-type neurons steadily increased the magnitude of the suppressive response, similar to neurons previously reported in the cerebellum. Switch-type neurons initially showed a transient response, but after several cycles, the direction of firing modulation reversed and the activity decreased for each repetitive stimulus. The time course of Switch-type activity was well explained by the weighted sum of activities of the other types of neurons. Furthermore, for only Switch-type neurons the activity just before stimulus omission significantly correlated with behavioral latency, indicating that this type of neuron may carry a more advanced signal in the system detecting stimulus omission. These results suggest that the central thalamus may transmit integrated signals to the cerebral cortex for temporal information processing, which are necessary to accurately predict rhythmic event timing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Several cortical and subcortical regions are involved in temporal information processing, and the thalamus will play a role in functionally linking them. The present study aimed to clarify how the paralaminar part of the thalamus transmits and modifies signals for temporal prediction of rhythmic events. Three types of thalamic neurons exhibited periodic activity when monkeys attempted to detect a single omission of isochronous repetitive stimuli. The activity of one type of neuron correlated with the behavioral latency and appeared to be generated by integrating the signals carried by the other types of neurons. Our results revealed the neuronal signals in the thalamus for temporal prediction of sensory events, providing a clue to elucidate information processing in the thalamocortical pathways.","temporal prediction, periodicity, phase transition, motor thalamus, single neuron, monkey",

Following injections of tritiated leucine and proline into selected pre- and post-Rolandic association areas in the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes, widespread projections were observed to one, or more typically, more than one of the major subdivisions of the caudate nucleus. When cortical areas having strong reciprocal cortico-cortical connections were compared, a considerable communality of their cortico-caudate projections was noted; depending on the location of the cortical areas, the region of common distribution lay within the head, the body, or the tail of the caudate nucleus. This correlation between cortico-cortical and cortico-striate projections characterized all pairs of cases studied. It suggests a previously undescribed principle of organization within the telencephalon, namely, that areas of cerebral cortex having reciprocal cortico-cortical connections, while having unique overall patterns of projection to the caudate nucleus, project, in part, to one and the same region of the nucleus. This might imply that a given region of the caudate nucleus receives input not only from a particular area of cortex, but also from all other cortical areas reciprocally interconnected with that area.",,

Thirty deposits of distinguishable retrograde tracers were placed at restricted sites spanning the medial frontal lobe in 16 cats. Following each deposit, the number of retrogradely labeled neurons in each of 17 thalamic nuclei was determined. Variations of the thalamic labeling pattern dependent on the location of the cortical tracer deposit were then analyzed by a quantitative procedure. The results indicate that the medial frontal lobe contains three fundamental divisions: the anterior cingulate area, medial area 6, and the medial prefrontal district. The anterior cingulate area derives its strongest thalamic input from the anteromedial nucleus. Medial area 6 is the target of afferents originating in a dorsolateral sector of the mediodorsal nucleus and in the ventroanterior nucleus. Medial prefrontal cortex is heavily innervated by pathways originating in the core of the mediodorsal nucleus and in the principal ventromedial nucleus. Within each major district, thalamic connectional patterns exhibit graded regional variation, with the result that, whereas the connections of the district are not uniform, it is difficult to define further discrete subdivisions. We discuss these results in relation to previously proposed schemes for parcellation of the cat's medial frontal lobe and conclude that the infralimbic and prelimbic areas (areas 25 and 32) of previous systems are best understood not as discrete areas but as ventral and intermediate sectors of a continuous medial prefrontal domain.",,

Furthermore, the connections between CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons in these visual areas were investigated at the light microscope level by using a dual-immunocytochemical staining procedure. The most significant findings were three-fold. First, the number and distribution of CB-ir and CR-ir double-bouquet cells and PV-ir chandelier cells differed considerably between different visual areas. In particular, the different distribution of double-bouquet cells was illustrated dramatically at the V1/V2 border, where CB-ir double-bouquet axons were very few or lacking in V1 but were very numerous in V2. Furthermore, PV-ir chandelier cell terminals were relatively sparse in V1, more frequent in V2, and most frequent in area TE. Second, the percentage of CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons receiving multiple contacts on their somata and proximal dendrites from other calcium-binding protein neurons varied between 22% and 85%. The highest percentage of contacts found between immunolabelled cells and multiterminals were for the combinations CR/CB (76–85%; percent of cells immunoreactive for CB that were innervated by multiterminals immunoreactive for CR), followed by the combination PV/CR (42–48%), and then by the other combinations that had similar percentages (22–32% for CR/PV; 26–37% for CB/CR; 29–42% for CR/PV). Third, differences in the relative proportions of CB, CR, and PV terminals in contact with CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons were consistent between the different cortical areas studied. Thus, certain characteristics of intraareal circuits differ, whereas others remain similar, in different areas of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. The differences may represent regional specializations related to the different processing of visual stimuli, whereas the similarities may be attributed to general functional requisites for interneuronal circuitry.

This can follow from laterally directed connections in the local circuit at the level of the cell in question but could also involve more complex interactions. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the cells relaying the retinal input display a concentric, center surround organization that in part follows from the similar organization characterizing the retinal cells providing their input. However, local thalamic inhibitory interneurons also play a role, and as we examine here, feedback from the visual cortex too. Here, we show in the primate (macaque) that spatially organized cortical feedback provides a clear and differential influence serving to enhance both responses to stimulation within the center of the receptive field and the ability of the nonclassical surround mechanism to attenuate this. In short, both center and surround mechanisms are influenced by the feedback. This dynamically sharpens the spatial focus of the receptive field and introduces nonlinearities from the cortical mechanism into the LGN.",,

The projection from the dLGN and its terminal boutons within layer 4C were visualized by immunodetection of the calcium binding protein, parvalbumin (PV), which is expressed in relay cells of the dLGN. The proportion of asymmetric synapses formed by PV-positive boutons within the α and β sublayers of 4C was estimated by using a nonbiased stereological counting method. The proportion of asymmetric synapses contributed by the PV-positive boutons to layer 4Cα is 8.7%; to 4Cβ is 6.9%. Assuming all the PV-positive asymmetric synapses derive from the dLGN relay cells, this gives a ratio of dLGN synapses per neuron of 192 in layer 4Cα and 128 in layer 4Cβ. Thus, the recurrent excitatory input from neighboring cortical neurons must play an important part in responses of the neurons lying at the input stage of the cortical circuit. J. Comp.

However, the sensation of increasing heat pain disappears, reaching a plateau as stimulus duration increases from 10 to 20 seconds. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 10 healthy subjects to determine if active central mechanisms could contribute to this psychophysical plateau. During heat pain durations ranging from 5 to 20 s, activation intensities in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices and the activation volume in the left primary (S1) somatosensory cortex correlated only with perceived stimulus intensity and not with stimulus duration. Activation volumes increased with both stimulus duration and perceived intensity in the left lateral thalamus, posterior insula, inferior parietal cortex, and hippocampus. In contrast, during the psychophysical plateau, both the intensity and volume of thalamic and cortical activations in the right medial thalamus, right posterior insula, and left secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex continued to increase with stimulus duration but not with perceived stimulus intensity. Activation volumes in the left medial and right lateral thalamus, and the bilateral mid-anterior cingulate, left orbitofrontal, and right S2 cortices also increased only with stimulus duration. The increased activity of specific thalamic and cortical structures as stimulus duration, but not perceived intensity, increases is consistent with the recruitment of a thalamocortical mechanism that participates in the modulation of pain-related cortical responses and the temporal summation of heat pain.",,

WGA-HRP was stereotactically injected into the central complex of 4 macaques and into the oral part of the lateral mass of the thalamus of 3 others. Neurons projecting to the central complex were located in the caudal, lateral and ventral region of the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the pallidum. Pallidal neurons projecting to the lateral mass of the thalamus were more numerous and occupied the entire volume of the medial pallidum apart from a small rostral and dorsomedial region. The location of the pallido-central complex neurons appeared to be included in that of the neurons projecting to the lateral mass. As very few neurons of this shared region were unlabeled, it is very likely that the same pallidal neurons project to both targets. The pallido-central complex neurons were located in the region crossed by axons coming from the putaminal sensorimotor territory of the striatum. These results provide further evidence that Nauta and Mehler's loop is a real closed loop probably involved in sensorimotor processing.","Thalamus; Centre médian-parafascicular complex; Pallidum; Basal ganglia; Macaque; A; nucleus anterior (thalami); CA; commissura anterior; Cd; nucleus caudatus; CePf; centre médian-parafascicular complex, or central complex; CP; commissura posterior; HP; horizontal probe; L; interhemispheric plane; LPo; nucleus lateralis polaris (thalami); MT; tractus mammillo-thalamicus; PaL; pallidum lateralis; PaM; pallidum medialis; PTh; nucleus perithalamicus, or reticularis; Pu; putamen; VOL; nucleus ventralis oralis lateralis (thalami), or Olszewski's nucleus ventralis pars oralis; VOM; nucleus ventralis oralis medialis (thalami), or Olszewski's nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis;",

It comprises many nuclear groups, each concerned with transmitting characteristic afferent signals to specific areas of the cerebral cortex. The thalamus is often described as the gateway to the cerebral cortex. The term “thalamus” is a Greek word meaning inner chamber. Its origin dates back to the 2nd Century AD, when Galen traced the optic-nerve fibers to an oval mass closely associated with the ventricles. This part of the brain known as the optic thalamus was later defined as a large mass of gray matter, involved with visual stimuli, and in the processing of all sensory modalities, except olfaction. The size of the thalamus is relatively small compared to that of the neocortex, but the functions of each major neocortical areas largely depend on the interactions with a well-defined thalamic-cell group. For this reason, an increase in size of any neocortical areas is correlated with a corresponding increase in the related thalamic nuclei. The nomenclature of the different nuclear subdivisions of the primate thalamus is more complex than in rodents. Although the thalamic cytoarchitecture in monkeys and humans is relatively similar, the nomenclature used to define thalamic nuclei in simians and humans has diverged so much over the years that non-specialist readers surely believe that the thalami of humans and monkeys are fundamentally different (Table 2). The main difference between human and nonhuman primate thalami is the relative growth of specific thalamic nuclei relative to other nuclear subdivisions; the pulvinar is the most representative example of a thalamic nucleus that has overgrown in the human brain. These keywords were added by machine and not by the authors. This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.",,

Although many of the connections linked neighboring areas, others selectively connected relatively distant areas. Most, but not all, of the connections were reciprocal. Altogether, the connections formed at least two distinct networks within the OMPFC. The “orbital” prefrontal network linked most of the areas within the orbital cortex, with very few connections to medial prefrontal areas. Areas Iam, Iapm, Ial, 121, 12m, and 12r in the caudal and lateral parts of the orbital cortex (which received inputs from several sensory modalities) had convergent connections with areas 13l, 13m, and 13b in the central orbital cortex, with further connections to the rostral orbital area 11l. For the connections between areas Iapm, Iam, Ial, 13m, 13l, and 11l, rostrally directed fibers arose mainly in layer V, whereas caudally directed fibers originated mainly in layer III. The “medial” prefrontal network selectively involved medial areas 14r, 14c, 24, 25, 32, and 10m, rostral orbital areas 10o and 11m, and agranular insular area Iai in the posterior orbital cortex. Two orbital areas, 13a and 12o, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections. The two networks also had distinct connections with other cortical regions, with limbic structures, and with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Their role in guidance of affective behavior is discussed. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

An algorithm for subdivision of the cerebral central white matter according to topographic criteria is developed in the companion manuscript. In the present paper we provide a rationale for this system of parcellation of the central white matter and we extend the system of cerebral parcellation to include principal subcortical gray structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. The volumetric measures of the subcortical gray and white matter parcellation units in 20 young adult brains are computed and reported here as well. In addition, with the comprehensive system for cerebral gray and white matter structure parcellation as reference, we formulate a systematics of forebrain connectivity. The degree to which functionally specific brain areas correspond to topographically specific areas is an open empirical issue. The resolution of this issue requires the development of topographically specific anatomic analyses, such as presented in the current system, and the application of such systems to a comprehensive set of functional–anatomic correlation studies in order to establish the degree of structural–functional correspondence. This system is expected to be applied in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience as an MRI-based topographic systematics of human forebrain anatomy with normative volumetric reference and also as a system of reference for the anatomic organization of specific neural systems as disrupted by focal lesions in lesion–deficit correlations.",,

Anatomical and physiological results were later related to histological distinctions in the same brains after sections were processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), or cytochrome oxidase (CO). The experiments produced serveral major findings. (1) Neurons throughout a broad expanse of cortex were highly responsive to pure tones, and best frequencies could be determined for neurons in arrays of recording sites. (2) The microelectrode recordings revealed two systematic representations of tone frequencies, the primary area (AI) and a primary-like rostral field (R) as previously described. The representation of high to low frequency tones in A1 was largely caudorostral along the plane of the sulcus. A reversal of the order of representation of frequencies occurred in R. (3) AI and R together were coextensive with a koniocellular, densely myelinated zone that expressed high levels of AchE and CO. These architectonic features were somewhat less pronounced in R than AI, but a clear border between the two areas was not apparent. (4) Cortex bordering AI and R was less responsive to tones, but when best frequencies for neurons could be determined, they matched those for adjoining parts of AI and R. (5) Architectonically distinct regions were apparent within some of the cortex bordering AI and R. (6) The major ipsilateral cortical connections of AI were with R and cortex immediately lateral and medial to AI. (7) Callosal connections of AI were predominately with matched locations in the opposite AI, but they also included adjoining fields.

Taking focal visual attention as an example, recent anatomical findings suggest that the pulvinar might act as a remote hub for coordinating spatial activity within multiple cortical visual maps. The pulvinar can, in turn, be influenced by signals originating in the frontal and parietal eye fields, using common visuomotor neural circuitry, with the superior colliculus acting as an important link. By identifying a complex, real neural architecture (‘RNA’) model for attention, it is possible to integrate several different modes of operation – such as parallel or serial, bottom-up or top-down, preattentive or attentive – that characterize conflicting cognitive models of attention in visual search paradigms.",,

The presence of four inferior subdivisions, comparable to those found in architectonic connectional studies in squirrel monkeys (C. G. Cusick, J Scripter, J. G. Darensbourg, and J. T. Weber, 1993, J. Comp. Neurol. 336:1–30), provided a basis for a proposed revised terminology for visual sectors of the macaque pulvinar. In the present study, the inferior pulvinar (PI) was identified as a neurochemically distinct region that included the traditional cytoarchitectonic nucleus PI and adjacent portions of the lateral and medial pulvmar nuclei, PL and PM. In calbindin-D28k stains, the lateral. subdivision of the inferior pulvinar (PIL) had less intense neuropil staining than the adjacent central division, PIc. The PIL was characterized by large, intensely immunopositive neurons seldom found within Plc. PIL occupied the traditional PL and PI and exhibited a shell zone, PIL-S, restricted to PL. The medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PIM) was in a location previously shown to be strongly connected with the middle temporal visual area (MT) in macaques. PIM was found in the medial one-half of the traditional PI and extended into adjacent portions of the traditional PM and PL. PIM was distinguished by less intense staining for calbindin and many cells stained with the SMI-32 antibody for neurofilament protein. In AChE stains, PIL was moderately dark, Plc appeared lighter, and PIM was characterized by small, intensely stained patches. The small posterior division (PIP) stained darkly for calbindin, lightly for AChE, and was unstained with the SMI-32 antibody. Thus, neurochemical, and perhaps connectional, subdivisions exist within PI, the region of the pulvinar that relays information to striate, “lower order” extrastriate, and inferotemporal visual cortex. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Neurons were characterized electrophysiologically based on intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic responses to stimulation of motor cortex and cerebellar nuclei, as described in the companion paper. Cerebellar-responsive neurons were stained intracellularly with either horseradish peroxidase or biocytin. All stained ventroanteriorventrolateral nucleus neurons were identified as thalamocortical neurons on anatomical (and often electrophysiological) grounds, consistent with previous findings that rat ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus is interneuron-sparse. Ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus neurons had three to eight thick primary dendrites. Proximal dendrites often exhibited a tufted branching pattern, from which many thinner, higher order dendrites arose. Dendrites branched to form a funnel-like infiltration of the neuropil that resulted in a spherical, roughly homogeneous dendritic field. The axon originated from the cell body or a proximal dendrite and coursed laterally and dorsally to innervate motor cortex. One to five axon collaterals were emitted in the rostral dorsolateral sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus; collaterals were not observed in the ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus or other nuclei in dorsal thalamus. The synaptic organization of the ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus was examined with electron microscopy, including two intracellularly labeled ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus neurons that were shown electrophysiologically to receive monosynaptic inputs from the cerebellum. The neuropil of rat ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus lacked the complexity and diversity found in corresponding thalamic nuclei of felines and primates, due to the paucity of interneurons. Vesicle-containing dendrites, dendrodendritic synapses and glomeruli were not observed. Three broad classes of presynaptic terminals were identified. (1) Small round boutons: small boutons containing densely-packed, small round vesicles that formed asymmetric synapses predominantly with the distal dendrites of thalamocortical neurons. These were the most prevalent type of bouton in the ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus (78% of presynaptic elements) and likely arose from the cerebral cortex. (2) Large round boutons: large terminals with loosely packed small round vesicles that made multiple asymmetric synapses with proximal and intermediate dendrites. Large round boutons comprised 8% of the neuropil, and likely arose from the cerebellar nuclei. (3) Medium size boutons with pleomorphic vesicles: mediumsized profiles containing pleomorphic vesicles that formed symmetric synapses with proximal, intermediate and distal dendrites and, less frequently, with cell bodies. These boutons constituted 14% of the neuropil, and their morphology was similar to previous descriptions of GABAergic immunoreactive profiles in rat ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus, as well as boutons originating from the thalamic reticular nucleus (which is the primary source of GABAergic input to the ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus). The synaptic organization of thalamocortical neurons and the scarcity of interneurons in the ventroanterior—ventrolateral nucleus is discussed in relation to the critical role of the thalamic reticular nucleus in modulating the efficacy of cortical and cerebellar afferents in the ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus and in determining the functional state of ventroanterior-ventrolateral nucleus neurons.",dLGN; dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; EPSP; excitatory postsynaptic potential; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; LR; large size boutons with round vesicles; MP; medium size boutons with pleomorphic vesicles; SR; small size boutons with round vesicles; TRN; thalamic reticular nucleus; VAL; ventroanterior-ventrolateral;,

Complex interactions within the zona incerta must take place to integrate its varied inputs and to produce a coherent efferent signal in order for this function to occur. However, whether the anatomical substrates exist within the zona incerta to allow this integration to take place has not been established. The zona incerta in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was examined in frontally, horizontally, and sagittally sectioned preparations stained for Nissl, myelinated fibers, or cytochrome oxidase, or impregnated by the Golgi technique. This nucleus can be separated into dorsal and ventral laminae on the basis of staining and morphological differences between these two subdivisions. Neurons are more densely packed, more darkly stained, and larger in the ventral lamina. In addition, the neuropil of the ventral lamina is much more intensely stained after cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Two neuronal types, principal cells and interneurons, were identified on the basis of neuronal cell body, dendritic, and axonal features in Golgi-impregnated preparations. Principal cells have fusiform or polygonal somata (long axis from 18 to 40 μm) and dendrites that extend for up to 750 μm within the lamina in which the cell bodies are located. Putative local interneurons have small (12–16 μm), round or oval cell bodies with wavy dendrites (up to 400 μm). Numerous multilobed appendages and axon-like processes originate from these dendrites and make apparent contacts with other interneurons or with dendrites of principal cells. Dendrites of most neurons in both laminae are oriented preferentially along the principal axis, dorsolateral-to-ventromedial, of the nucleus. Therefore, within the limits of light microscopy, the zona incerta appears to possess the morphological heterogeneity to form complex intrinsic interactions. These interactions are hypothesized to form the integrative substrate for the large array of incertal inputs that are utilized to produce an efferent signal involved in the initiation of saccadic eye movements.",,

A total of 203 neurons displaying movement-related changes in activity were examined in detail. Most of these cells (69%) showed an increase in firing rate in relation to the onset of movement and could be categorized according to whether they fired in the VT task exclusively, in the IG task exclusively, or in both tasks. The proportion of cells in each category was found to vary between each of the cerebellar-receiving [oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo) and area X] and basal-ganglia-receiving [oral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and parvocellular portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)] nuclei that were examined. In particular, in area X the largest group of cells (52%) showed an increase in activity during the VT task only, whereas in VApc the largest group of cells (53%) fired in the IG task only. In contrast to this, relatively high degree of task specificity, in both VPLo and VLo the largest group of cells (∼55%) burst in relation to both tasks. Of the cells that were active in both tasks, a higher proportion were preferentially active in the VT task in VPLo and area X, and the IG task in VLo and VApc. In addition, cells in all four nuclei became active earlier relative to movement onset in the IG task compared with the VT task. These results demonstrate that functional distinctions do exist in the cerebellar- and basal-ganglia-receiving portions of the primate motor thalamus in relation to the types of cues used to initiate and control movement. These distinctions are most clear in area X and VApc, and are much less apparent in VPLo and VLo.",,

Orbital and medial prefrontal cortices receive input from cortical and subcortical structures associated with emotions. Thus, the prefrontal cortex may be an essential link for autonomic responses driven by emotions. Classic studies have demonstrated the existence of projections between prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus, a central autonomic structure, but the topographic organization of these connections in the monkey has not been clearly established. We investigated the organization of bidirectional connections between these areas in the rhesus monkey by using tracer injections in orbital, medial, and lateral prefrontal areas. All prefrontal areas investigated received projections from the hypothalamus, originating mainly in the posterior hypothalamus. Differences in the topography of hypothalamic projection neurons were related to both the location and type of the target cortical area. Injections in lateral eulaminate prefrontal areas primarily labeled neurons in the posterior hypothalamus that were equally distributed in the lateral and medial hypothalamus. In contrast, injections in orbitofrontal and medial limbic cortices labeled neurons in the anterior and tuberal regions of the hypothalamus and in the posterior region. Projection neurons targeting orbital limbic cortices were more prevalent in the lateral part of the hypothalamus, whereas those targeting medial limbic cortices were more prevalent in the medial hypothalamus. In comparison to the ascending projections, descending projections from prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus were highly specific, originating mostly from orbital and medial prefrontal cortices. The ascending and descending connections overlapped in the hypothalamus in areas that have autonomic functions. These results suggest that specific orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal areas exert a direct influence on the hypothalamus and may be important for the autonomic responses evoked by complex emotional situations.

Receptive fields and response characteristics were determined for closely spaced recording sites along arrays of electrode penetrations that passed through the ventral thalamus dorsoventrally, rostrocaudally, or lateromedially. The results were related to thalamic architecture and led to the following conclusions: (1) A large, single, systematic representation of the body surface occupied most or all of the ventroposterior nucleus, VP. The nucleus was further defined by a distinct cytoarchitectonic appearance, produced by densely packed, deeply stained neurons. (2) Recording sequences in VP were characterized by (a) abrupt shifts in receptive field locations over short recording distances indicating that the electrode had crossed discontinuities or folds in the representation, (b) long sequences of overlapping receptive fields indicating regions of continuous representation and the maintenance of adjacency in the map, and (c) similar receptive Held locations for sites along the trajectory of a penetration indicating regions of isorepresentation. Major somatotopic discontinuities were associated with crossing narrow cell-poor laminae that partially divided VP into subnuclei related to the hand, foot, trunk, and tail in lateral VP and the face in medial VP. Somatotopic discontinuities occurred for electrode penetrations in all three planes, but discontinuities were greater and more frequent for lateromedial electrode penetrations. Lines of isorepresentation and gradual change were most extensive in the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral planes. We hypothesize that the disruptions, regions of isorepresentation, and regions of gradual change result from the thickening, splitting, and folding of a two-dimensional representation of the skin surface to occupy a three-dimensional volume. (3) The magnifications of various skin surfaces in VP were variable so that some skin surfaces, especially the tips of the digits, occupied relatively large portions of the nucleus, while other skin surfaces such as the trunk activated little tissue. It appeared that regions of isorepresentation varied in extent according to magnification factor and position in the map. (4) Within VP, neurons could be classified as slowly adapting or rapidly adapting to maintained skin indentation. Each type of neuron formed small groups or clusters in the nucleus so that several successive recording sites typically encountered one type before a sequence of the other type was observed. (5) Neurons ventrocaudal to VP formed a second representation of the body in the ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI). Recordings and cytoarchitecture suggest that VPI extends further caudal than generally recognized, to include a part of the region caudal to VP that is sometimes described as part of the posterior group (Po) of thalamic nuclei. Body parts represented in VP were represented again in VPI in a roughly parallel sequence so that in both nuclei the caudal body was lateral and the rostral body was medial. Neurons in VPI were activated by inputs from pacinianlike receptors. Such activation was not observed in VP. (6) A 1.0-1.5 mm thick band of tissue along the dorsal and rostrodorsal borders of VP was responsive to manipulation of deep body tissues including muscles and joints. The mapping evidence was compatible with the existence of one or more representations of deep receptors roughly parallel to the cutaneous representation in VP. Patterns of thalamocortical connections suggest subdividing the thalamic zone of activation by deep receptors into a ventroposterior oral nucleus, VPO, relaying muscle spindle information to cortical area 3a, and a ventroposterior superior nucleus, VPS, relaying deep receptor inputs to area 2.",,

A combination of single- and dual-tracer techniques was used to study their topography and to establish whether these zones occupy separate or overlapping pulvinar territories. In each case, the retinotopic distribution of tracer in the pulvinar was charted by reference to its parallel distribution within the maps of cortical areas V1 and V2. Each of the areas V3, V4, and V5 were found to connect with both the 1° and the 2° maps located within the inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei and to respect the previously identified topographies of these maps. However, V5 connects to a narrow zone lining the rostrolateral margin of the lateral and inferior pulvinar and V4 to a broader zone within the body of these two nuclei, which is adjacent to but separate from the V5 zone; the V3 zone overlaps both. Focal injections into cortex produce columns of pulvinar label whose trajectory defines a line of isorepresentation. The lines of isorepresentation in the 1° and 2° maps are approximately linear and parallel and adopt a rostrolateral to caudomedial axis; in the 1° map, this axis is roughly perpendicular to the facet of the inferior pulvinar that lies adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The connections of V5 and V4 can be modelled as successive zones along the axis of isorepresentation, with registered visual topographies. The scheme is extended by existing reports that inferotemporal cortex connects to the caudomedial pole of this axis—reflecting an occipitotemporal cortical gradient, in that V1 and other prestriate areas, e.g., V3, connect to the opposite pole. Thus a simple model of the mapped volume in the pulvinar arises, in which a unidimensional cortical topography is represented orthogonally to retinal topography. Adjoining this volume medially, within the inferior and medial pulvinar, is a second, heavier zone of V5 connectivity, which is poorly topographic. Both the medial and the rostrolateral zones of V5 connectivity may overlap with previously identified regions of tectal input to the pulvinar.J. Comp.

The centromedian (centre median, CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei are an important source of thalamostriatal projections. Anterograde tract-tracing indicates the CM–Pf complex provides dense afferents to the matrix compartment of the striatum. Whereas CM projects to the entire sensorimotor territory of the striatum, the Pf provides complementary input to the entire associative sector. The Pf also provides lighter input to the nucleus accumbens. Both CM and Pf provide light to moderately dense inputs to other components of the basal ganglia in a largely complementary manner, covering motor or associative-limbic territories of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral midbrain. In turn, the CM and Pf receive mainly segregated input from parallel motor and associative-limbic circuits of the basal ganglia. The CM and Pf may therefore be considered important participants in parallel processing of motor and associative-limbic information in the basal ganglia. Connections of the CM and Pf with other thalamic nuclei suggest they also participate in integrative functions within the thalamus. In addition, inputs from the brainstem reticular core, reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex and reticular thalamic nucleus suggest a role in state-dependant information processing. Consideration of the differential connections of the CM and Pf, and better understanding of their role in pathophysiology, may eventually lead to development of an important new target for relief of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",,

In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2–6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25–0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal.

They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure–ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.",,

Neurons of laminae 4B, 4A, and 3B","We continue an investigation of the organization of local circuit neurons (largely inhibitory, GABAergic neurons, with smooth or sparsely spined dendrites) in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkey (Lund, '87: J. Comp. Neurol. 257:60–92; Lund et al., '88: J. Comp. Neurol. 276:1–29). This account covers local circuit neurons of layers 4B, 4A, and 3B; these three layers each receive different intrinsic second-order relays of principal thalamic inputs as well as receiving primary thalamic inputs in the case of two of the three laminae (4A and 3B). The study shows the existence of a number of different local circuit neurons making interlaminar projections between 4B, 4A, and 3B; each provides specific cross links between different combinations of the three laminae. It is known that the functional properties recorded physiologically from layers 4B, 4A, and 3B differ from one another and so these anatomical cross links may allow for correlation between different attributes of visual stimuli, e.g., color or motion, while still enabling separate processing of these different attributes to proceed in each of the three layers and be passed on to extrastriate areas. Whereas no spine-bearing neurons of layers 4B, 4A, or 3B provide “feedback” circuits to layer 4C (the source of their major intrinsic excitatory afferents), some of the local circuit neurons provide precisely structured axon feedback projections to divisions of 4C. The local circuit neurons also project to either lamina 5 or lamina 6, but not both and to superficial layers 3A, 2, and 1. Some local circuit neuron axon projections are of a dimension that would be confined to single functional clusters, e.g., cytochrome-rich “blobs,” others reach out far enough to contact nearest neighbor “unlike” functional clusters, and yet others spread far enough to link repeating clusters of single function.",,

Injections were placed in the major somatotopic divisions of M1 (the hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, and face representations) and in the caudal and rostral M1 subareas. In most cases, we injected several differentiable tracers into different parts of M1. Our results indicate that the strongest connections of M1 are with subdivisions of the ventral lateral thalamus (VL); other connections are mainly with intralaminar nuclei (the central lateral, paracentral, and center median nuclei) and the reticular nucleus. Most projections are reciprocal and topographically organized. M1 is strongly connected with the principal (VLp), medial (VLx), and anterior (VLa) subdivisions of the VL complex but has at most weak connections with the dorsal division (VLd). Each of the major somatotopic divisions of M1 is connected with an anteroposteriorly elongated territory within the VL complex. The connections are somatotopically organized such that the M1 hindlimb representation is connected with a band of cells in the lateral and anterior portions of the VL complex (spanning VLa and VLp), whereas the trunk, forelimb, and face representations are connected with successively more medially and posteriorly situated cell bands (spanning VLa, VLp, and VLx). There is some degree of overlap between the somatotopic territories within VL, although the absence of double-labeled cells in cases with injections of adjacent somatotopic divisions of M1 suggests that individual thalamic neurons project to single somatotopic regions. In addition to somatotopic differences, the connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of M1 differ to some extent. Caudal M1 is connected most strongly with VLp, a target of cerebellar projections, but it is also connected with VLa, which receives pallidal inputs. In complementary fashion, rostral M1 is most strongly connected with VLa, but it is also connected with VLp. VLx, a target of cerebellar projections, has significant connections with both caudal and rostral M1. These results indicate that all parts of M1 are influenced by both the cerebellum and globus pallidus in owl monkeys, as has been suggested in some recent studies of macaque monkeys. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

We now describe the presence and distribution of the PTH2R and TIP39 in the brain of primates using a range of tissues and ages from macaque and human brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry of TIP39 mRNA, studied in young macaque brain, due to its possible decline beyond late postnatal ages, was present only in the thalamic subparafascicular area and the pontine medial paralemniscal nucleus. In contrast in situ hybridization histochemistry in macaque identified high levels of PTH2R expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, medial geniculate, and the pontine tegmentum. PTH2R mRNA was also detected in several human brain areas by RT-PCR. The distribution of PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in human, determined by immunocytochemistry, was similar to that in rodents including dense fiber networks in the medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular, periventricular and infundibular (arcuate) nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, median eminence, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nuclei, medullary dorsal reticular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Co-localization suggested that PTH2R fibers are glutamatergic, and that TIP39 may directly influence hypophysiotropic somatostatin containing and indirectly influence corticotropin releasing-hormone containing neurons.

Four to six slightly branched dendrites of unequal thickness radiate from the cell body. Some dendrites extend for nearly 500 microns; all have dendritic spines. In the nucleus parafascicularis there are two varieties of principal neurons:(1) neurons with somatic spines and(2) neurons without somatic spines. The neurons with somatic spines are most numerous. They have polygonal-shaped cell bodies, prominent somatic spines and processes, larger than spines but considerably smaller than dendrites. These processes bear spines and are designated here “microdendrites.” Spines and occasionally a “microdendrite” are found on the axon-hillocks. Five to six dendrites of unequal thickness emerge from the cell bodies. Some extend for more than 500 microns; all have prominent dendritic spines. The neurons without somatic spines are relatively few. Usually three exceptionally long, slightly branched dendrites, one apical and two basal, emerge from their elongated, slim cell bodies. Some dendrites extend for more than 800 microns; all have a few scattered spines. The Golgi type II neurons found in both of these intralaminar nuclei have small cell bodies and a few, relatively long, undulating dendrites, which bear bulbous dendritic appendages and beaded axon-like processes. Distally on these dendrites, where the appendages and processes are more numerous, the dendritic appendages and axon-like processes form complex entanglements. Beaded axons are found on some but not all of the cell bodies. Morphologically these neurons resemble the local interneurons that have been described in various thalamic nuclei.",,

However, differences between areas remain largely unknown, and it is not clear whether there is a hierarchy in cortical vestibular processing. We examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of macaque vestibular responses to translational motion stimuli using both empirical and model-based analyses. Temporal dynamics of direction selectivity were similar across areas, although there was a gradual shift in the time of peak directional tuning, with responses in MSTd typically being delayed by 100–150 ms relative to responses in PIVC (VIP was intermediate). Responses as a function of both stimulus direction and time were fit with a spatiotemporal model consisting of separable spatial and temporal response profiles. Temporal responses were characterized by a Gaussian function of velocity, a weighted sum of velocity and acceleration, or a weighted sum of velocity, acceleration, and position. Velocity and acceleration components contributed most to response dynamics, with a gradual shift from acceleration dominance in PIVC to velocity dominance in MSTd. The position component contributed little to temporal responses overall, but was substantially larger in MSTd than PIVC or VIP. The overall temporal delay in model fits also increased substantially from PIVC to VIP to MSTd. This gradual transformation of temporal responses suggests a hierarchy in cortical vestibular processing, with PIVC being most proximal to the vestibular periphery and MSTd being most distal.",,

Our findings show that axons which arise from deep collicular neurons terminate within several dorsal thalamic nuclei which in turn project upon the frontal eye fields (area 8) and the inferior parietal lobule (area 7). Both of these cortical areas are functionally quite similar to the deep colliculus, and we suggest that ascending channels from the deep tectum must account, at least in part, for these functional similarities. The present autoradiographs reveal projections to several nuclear zones previously not identified as deep collicular targets in the monkey. Such targets include the visceral cell columns of the oculomotor complex, the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, and the magnocellular division of the ventral anterior nucleus. Deep tectal input also has been shown to terminate quite extensively within the paralamellar region of the mediodorsal nucleus and in the parafascicular nucleus; very little input to the central lateral and centromedian nuclei was observed. Radioisotope injections restricted to the superficial layers reveal dense projections to the parabigeminal nucleus, the pretectum, the inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei, and to the ventral and dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei.

This method enables visualization of individual AChE-containing neuronal somata and their processes to a degree not possible with other protocols for the enzyme. The strongest AChE activity occurring at the level of the thalamus is found within the small, round to oval, somata of nucleus anterior dorsalis. Most of the intralaminar nuclei, as well as nucleus reticularis, are composed of mediumsized multipolar neurons displaying moderate to strong AChE activity. Moderately stained AChE neurons are also found in pars ventralis of nucleus geniculatus lateralis and in pars lateralis of nucleus habenularis. Most of the neurons of the lateral and posterior thalamic territories, however, are nearly devoid of AChE. At the level of the hypothalamus, the neurons of nuclei supraopticus and paraventricularis show strong AChE activity. The AChE neurons of nucleus supraopticus are surrounded by numerous AChE-containing processes of some large lateral preoptic area neurons that stain intensely for the enzyme. Numerous intensely stained AChE perikarya occur in the lateral, dorsal, and supramammillary hypothalamic areas. These neurons often possess several AChE-containing processes.

Action selection in the face of dynamic reward associations requires several cognitive processes: registering a change in value of the primary reinforcer, adjusting the value of secondary reinforcers to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer, and guiding action selection to optimal choices. Flexible responding has been evaluated extensively using reinforcer devaluation tasks. Performance on this task relies upon amygdala, Areas 11 and 13 of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Differential contributions of amygdala and Areas 11 and 13 of OFC to specific sub-processes have been established, but the role of MD in these sub-processes is unknown. Pharmacological inactivation of the macaque MD during specific phases of this task revealed that MD is required for reward valuation and action selection.

His Golgi material showed “specific” fibers, which arborize densely in very restricted cortical domains, and “unspecific” fibers, which distribute sparsely across large cortical expanses. These initial anatomical observations were embraced by electrophysiologists who electrically stimulated thalamic nuclei in cats and recorded two fundamentally different kinds of cortical response, depending on the locus of stimulation. “Specific” and “nonspecific” thalamic nuclei were named according to their ability to elicit restricted cortical “augmenting” or widespread “recruiting” responses, respectively (Morison and Dempsey, 1942; Dempsey and Morison, 1942b). During the 1940s and 1950s a consensus took hold—that the specific system defined anatomically was the same as that defined electrophysiologically and, likewise, that the unspecific axons in cortex are the substrate for recruiting evoked in widespread areas and, therefore, arise from the nonspecific nuclei.

Severity of deficits and the degree of recovery have been associated with widespread network dysfunction, yet it is not clear how these behavioural and functional brain changes relate with the underlying structural white matter tracts. Here, we investigated whether recovery after unilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions was associated with changes in white matter microstructure across large-scale frontoparietal cortical and thalamocortical networks. Diffusion-weighted imaging was acquired in four male rhesus macaques at pre-lesion, week 1, and week 8-16 post-lesion when target selection deficits largely recovered. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct cortical frontoparietal fiber tracts, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and transcallosal fibers connecting the PFC or posterior parietal cortex (PPC), as well as thalamocortical fiber tracts connecting the PFC and PPC to thalamic nuclei. We found that the two animals with small PFC lesions showed increased fractional anisotropy in both cortical and thalamocortical fiber tracts when behaviour had recovered. However, we found that fractional anisotropy decreased in cortical frontoparietal tracts after larger PFC lesions yet increased in some thalamocortical tracts at the time of behavioural recovery. These findings indicate that behavioural recovery after small PFC lesions may be supported by both cortical and subcortical areas, whereas larger PFC lesions may have induced widespread structural damage and hindered compensatory remodeling in the cortical frontoparietal network.",Diffusion MRI; Probabilistic tractography; Saccades; Target selection; Endothelin-1; Nonhuman primates;,

In contrast, executive dysfunctions could not be shown so readily to depend upon a single structure of the thalamus.

The responses of single neurons in the insular gustatory cortex to the protypical taste stimuli glucose, NaCl, HCl and quinine HCl, and to fruit juice were measured before, while, and after the monkey was fed to satiety with glucose or fruit juice. (2) While behavior turned from avid acceptance to active rejection upon repletion, the responsiveness of the neurons to the stimulus array, including the satiating solution, was unmodified. (3) It is concluded that in the insular gustatory cortex, neuronal responses to gustatory stimuli are not influenced by the normal transition from hunger to satiety. This is in contrast to the responses of a population of neurons recorded in the hypothalamus, which only respond to the taste of food when the monkey is hungry. Thus the neurons in the insular gustatory cortex are involved in a motivation-independent analysis of gustatory stimuli, whereas the hypothalamic neurons may be more closely related to the influence of motivational state on behavioral responsiveness to gustatory stimuli.",Taste; Hunger; Satiety; Gustatory cortex; Primate; Sensory-specific satiety;,

The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus. The ventral pallidal projections to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are arranged such that dorsal-to-ventral and medial-to-lateral gradients in the ventral pallidum correspond to medial-to-lateral and rostral-to-caudal gradients in the mediodorsal nucleus, respectively. This topography in the ventral pallidal-mediodorsal thalamic pathways fits in with the parallel arrangement of a number of circuits that involve distinct parts of the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Such a parallel arrangement of the connections of the ventral parts of the basal ganglia with the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal thalamus is consistent with the more general concept of parallel, functionally segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits.",CTb; cholera toxin subunit B; DAB; diaminobenzidine; EDTA; ethylenediamine tetra-acetate; PAP; peroxidase-antiperoxidase; PBS; phosphatebuffered saline; PHA-L; Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin; TBS-T; TRIS-buffered saline with Triton; TH; tyrosine hydroxylase; VP; ventral pallidum; VP1; lateral part of VP; VPm; medial part of VP; VPvm; ventromedial VP; VPdl; dorsolateral VP;,

Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what neural response a given MiSt will produce and possibly allow the development of natural “sensation.” To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here, we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we used MiSt in the VPL of macaques, which have a somatosensory system more like humans, as compared to our previous rat work (Li et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post-stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt toward producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.","somatosensory, cortex, macaque, hand, thalamus (VPL), brain-machine interface (BMI)",

These attention mechanisms are classically viewed as being solely implemented in the cortex, relegating the thalamus to a passive relay of sensory information. However, this passive view of the thalamus is being revised in light of recent studies supporting an important role for the thalamus in selective attention. Evidence suggests that the first-order thalamic nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, regulates the visual information transmitted from the retina to visual cortex, while the higher-order thalamic nucleus, the pulvinar, regulates information transmission between visual cortical areas, according to attentional demands. This chapter discusses how modulation of thalamic responses, switching the response mode of thalamic neurons, and changes in neural synchrony across thalamo-cortical networks contribute to selective attention.",attention; oscillations; synchrony; pulvinar; lateral geniculate nucleus; thalamic reticular nucleus; diffusion tensor imaging; multi-electrode recordings;,

The Vim nucleus forms part of a relatively “cell-sparse zone” which includes the other ventrolateral thalamic subnuclei. It is distinguished by the presence of darkly stained, large and medium sized, angular cells with areas of approximately 500–1,000 microns 2 and 300-400 microns 2, respectively, and a cell density of approximately 50-90 (mean 65)/mm2 in 50-microns-thick sections. 3. Both sets of neurons have the characteristics of thalamocortical relay neurons in Golgi preparations. Large neurons have rectangular or square somata 30-50 microns diam and are concentrated mainly in the lateral and ventral two-thirds of the nucleus. The medium neurons have square to round somata, 15–25 microns diam, and are distributed homogeneously through the nucleus. The total dendritic arborization of both types is usually symmetrical in all directions and at least 500–600 microns diam. 4. The borders between the Vim nucleus and the Nucleus ventrooralis (Vo) and between the Vim nucleus and the Nucleus ventrocaudalis internus (Vci) are clearly identified by clearcut differences in cell size and cell density. The borders between the Vim nucleus and the Nucleus ventrooralis internus (Voi) and between the Vim nucleus and the Nucleus zentrolateralis intermedius (Zim) are quite obscure, and these nuclei, with Vim, seem to be parts of the large cell sparse zone comparable to that described in monkeys as VLp or VL. The border between the Vim nucleus and the Nucleus ventrocaudalis externus anterior (Vcea) is also unclear but the increased cell density and intermingling of small and medium-to-small neurons with large neurons are the major features that distinguish the Vcea nucleus from the Vim nucleus cytometrically. 5.

A primary antiserum directed against the human form of the peptide was utilized. Immunoreactive neuronal perikarya and processes were evident in numerous areas, and the distributions of these elements were similar for the two species. As previously reported for rats, monkeys, and human, intense immunoreactivity was evident in putative hypophyseal neurons in the parvicellular component of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and in fibers extending from this area into the median eminence. The results for other brainstem regions, most of which have been previously examined for CRF-LI only in rats, indicate that many similarities exist between rats and monkeys in the distribution of this peptide in brainstem extrahypophyseal neuronal circuits, although substantial differences are also evident. For example, immunoreactive perikarya previously observed in other hypothalamic nuclei in rats were not evident in monkeys. Conversely, in monkeys, unlike rats, labeled perikarya were evident in several thalamic nuclei, especially in the intralaminar complex. Also, two large groups of immunoreactive neurons which have generally not been observed in rat studies were present in the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. In the mesencephalon this consisted of a group of neurons just lateral to the mesencephalic tegmentum, extending throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the midbrain. In the rhombencephalon, labeled perikarya were observed throughout the inferior olive. Some of the differences between rats and monkeys in the locations of labeled perikarya may be due to differences in antiserum specificity and/or sensitivity, or they may result from the fact that colchicine pretreatment was not utilized in the present study. The distributions of immunoreactive fibers also exhibited similarities and differences between monkeys and rats. The most striking terminal fields observed in the present study which have not been previously described are a moderate-to-dense field within and adjacent to presumed dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, a dense innervation of certain subdivisions of the interpeduncular nucleus, and a regionally and parasagittally organized distribution of fibers in the Purkinje cell and molecular layers of the cerebellar cortex. Thus, the present results suggest that there are substantial differences between rodents and primates in the cellular distribution of CRF-LI in the brain and spinal cord. However, technical differences between the rat and monkey experiments may account for some of these contrasting distributions.",,

In order to examine this issue we employed a ‘double labeling’ procedure which utilized transport of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in the same macaque. One tracer substance was injected into the cervical spinal cord and the other was injected into the rostral zone of primary motor cortex. We observed no overlap of spinothalamic terminations and thalamic regions which project to the motor cortex. Thus, our results provide no anatomical support for a direct thalamic relay of peripheral afferent input to the motor cortex of primates.",spinothalamic tract; motor cortex; thalamus (motor); direct relay of afferent input;,

Despite the therapeutic benefits, the mechanisms of action are varied and complex, and the pathophysiology and genesis of tremor remain unsubstantiated. This intraoperative study investigated the effects of high frequency microstimulation on both neuronal firing and tremor suppression simultaneously. In each of nine essential tremor and two Parkinson’s disease patients who underwent stereotactic neurosurgery, two closely spaced (600 µm) microelectrodes were advanced into the ventral intermediate nucleus. One microelectrode recorded action potential firing while the adjacent electrode delivered stimulation trains at 100 Hz and 200 Hz (2–5 s, 100 µA, 150 µs). A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure postural tremor of the contralateral hand. At 200 Hz, stimulation led to 68 ± 8% (P < 0.001) inhibition of neuronal firing and a 53 ± 5% (P < 0.001) reduction in tremor, while 100 Hz reduced firing by 26 ± 12% (not significant) with a 17 ± 6% (P < 0.05) tremor reduction. The degree of cell inhibition and tremor suppression were significantly correlated (P < 0.001). We also found that the most ventroposterior stimulation sites, closest to the border of the ventral caudal nucleus, had the best effect on tremor. Finally, prior to the inhibition of neuronal firing, microstimulation caused a transient driving of neuronal activity at stimulus onset (61% of sites), which gave rise to a tremor phase reset (73% of these sites). This was likely due to activation of the excitatory glutamatergic cortical and cerebellar afferents to the ventral intermediate nucleus. Temporal characteristics of the driving responses (duration, number of spikes, and onset latency) significantly differed between 100 Hz and 200 Hz stimulation trains. The subsequent inhibition of neuronal activity was likely due to synaptic fatigue. Thalamic neuronal inhibition seems necessary for tremor reduction and may function in effect as a thalamic filter to uncouple thalamo-cortical from cortico-spinal reflex loops. Additionally, our findings shed light on the gating properties of the ventral intermediate nucleus within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network, provide insight for the optimization of deep brain stimulation technologies, and may inform controlled clinical studies for assessing optimal target locations for the treatment of tremor.","clinical neurophysiology, deep brain stimulation, neurosurgery, tremor, Parkinson’s disease",

Neurons in the amygdala are implicated in mediating hedonic appreciation, emotional expression, and conditioning, particularly as these relate to feeding. The amygdala receives projections from the primary taste cortex in monkeys, offering a route by which it could gain access to the gustatory information required to guide feeding behavior. We recorded the activity of 35 neurons in the amygdala of alert rhesus macaques in response to a range of gustatory intensities and qualities to characterize taste-evoked activity in this area. 2. The stimulus array comprised 26 chemicals, including four concentrations of each of the four basic taste stimuli, a series of other sugars, salts, and acids, monosodium glutamate, and orange juice. 3. Neurons responsive to taste stimulation could be found in a 76-mm3 region of the amygdala, centered 9.1 mm lateral to the midline, 14.9 mm anterior to the interaural line, and 25.7 mm below the surface of the dura. They composed 7.2% (35/484) of the cells tested for gustatory sensitivity in the amygdala. 4. The mean spontaneous activity of taste cells was 8.2 +/- 2.3 (SE) spikes per second. This rather high level provided an opportunity for reductions from spontaneous rate that was used regularly in the amygdala. When these negative response rates were included, the mean breadth-of-tuning coefficient of this sample of taste cells was 0.82. There was no strong evidence for gustatory neuron types, nor were functionally similar cells located together in a chemotopic arrangement. 5. Responses across 1.5 log units of stimulus concentration were nearly flat, with increasing excitation in some neurons largely offset by increasing inhibition in others. Taking the absolute value of the evoked activity, concentration-response functions rose monotonically to all basic stimuli except HCl, but were not sufficiently steep to account for human psychophysical data. The neural response to HCl did not rise with stimulus concentration within the range used. 6. Neural patterns representing the taste qualities of the basic stimuli were less sharply separated in the amygdala than at lower-order gustatory relays. Glucose elicited activity patterns that were most distinct from those of the nonsweet chemicals; those associated with NaCl were next most distinct. There was no clear separation between the patterns generated by chemicals that humans describe as sour and bitter. Monosodium glutamate evoked responses that did not correlate well with those of any basic stimulus, implying that its quality cannot be subsumed under the four basic tastes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

A degeneration study,"The projection from the lateral cervical nucleus (LCN) to the thalamus has been investigated in macaque monkeys. After electrolytic lesions of the LCN, the degeneration was studied in sections impregnated by the Wiitanen method. The cervicothalamic fibers cross the midline at their level of origin and ascend to the thalamus in the medial lemniscus. A small ipsilateral projection may also exist. The tract terminates in the posteromedial (POm) and ventralis posterolateralis (VPL) nuclei. Termination in the POm is indicated by the presence of a small number of thin preterminal fibers. In the VPL the cervicothalamic fibers are unevenly distributed, forming patches of moderately dense preterminal networks, mainly in the medial two-thirds of the nucleus. Rostrocaudally the termination is restricted to areas corresponding to Olszewski's VPLc. Compared to cat, the cervicothalamic projection to the VPL in the monkey appears considerably smaller. It is also much smaller than the spinothalamic projection to the VPL in the monkey. The results neither confirm nor exclude a small projection to the nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) from the lateral cervical nucleus.",lateral cervical nucleus; cervicothalamic tract; thalamus; degeneration method; monkey;,

To assess the reciprocal functional connectivity between PuM and cortex, we studied intracerebral-evoked responses obtained after PuM and cortical electrical stimulation in 7 epileptic patients undergoing depth electroencephalographic recordings. Cortical-evoked potentials (CEPs) to PuM stimulation were recorded from all explored cortical regions, except striate cortex, anterior cingulated, and postcentral gyrus. Percentages of cortical contacts pairs responding to PuM stimulation (CEPs response rate) ranged from 80% in temporal neocortex, temporoparietal (TP) junction, insula, and frontoparietal opercular cortex to 34% in mesial temporal regions. Reciprocally, PuM-evoked potentials (PEPs) response rates were 14% after cortical stimulation in insula and frontoparietal opercular cortex, 67% in the TP junction, 76% in temporal neocortex, and 80% in mesial temporal regions. Overall, our study of functional PuM connectivity in the human brain converges with most of the data from anatomical studies in monkeys, except for a strong amygdalohippocampal functional projection to PuM and an unexpected imbalance between some of the reciprocal pathways explored. This functional quantitative approach helps to clarify the functional role of PuM as well as its implication in temporal lobe epileptic seizures.",epilepsy; evoked potentials; functional connectivity; human medial pulvinar; thalamocortical pathways;,

We have therefore studied the pattern of intrinsic intra- and interlaminar pyramidal neuron connectivity in prefrontal areas 9 and 46 (of Walker) in macaque monkey cerebral cortex (anterior to the arcuate sulcus between the principal sulcus and midline). We made focal (200–400 μm) injections of biocytin and mapped the pattern of orthogradely transported label. Injections made into the superficial layers label wide-ranging lateral projections within the same areas of prefrontal cortex. Projections local to such small injections form a narrow band of terminals in layers 1–3 (200–400 μm wide, 2–4 mm long) centered on the injection site. Collateral fibers spread orthogonal to this terminal band, making frequent bifurcations, to establish a series of parallel bands of terminals with uninnervated bands between, spaced regularly across the cortex (center to center 500–600 μm). The entire pattern of terminal label is stripelike, with occasional narrower interbands and crosslinks between the bands, and can extend over 7–8 mm across the cortex. These projections arise from pyramidal neurons in layers 2, 3, and 5 and terminate in layers 1–3. The stripelike pattern contrasts with patchlike patterns in other cortical regions (V1, V2, V4, motor, somatosensory) and is smaller in scale than stripelike zones of corticocortical afferent terminals to this region, reported to be 300–750 μm wide and spaced 1.0–1.5 mm center to center. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

In addition, the recently defined, rich innervation of 'higher' thalamic nuclei (such as the pulvinar) from pyramidal cells in layer five of the neocortex also comes from branches of long descending axons that supply motor structures. For many higher thalamic nuclei the clue to understanding the messages that are relayed to the cortex will depend on knowing the nature of these layer five motor outputs and on defining how messages from groups of functionally distinct output types are combined as inputs to higher cortical areas. Current evidence indicates that many and possibly all thalamic relays to the neocortex are about instructions that cortical and subcortical neurons are contributing to movement control. The perceptual functions of the cortex can thus be seen to represent abstractions from ongoing motor instructions.",,

The cellular features which contribute to the functional specialization of its subsectors are poorly understood. In this study we determined the distribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in structurally and functionally distinct prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey. This class of neurons express nitric oxide synthase which is necessary for the production of nitric oxide, a novel neural messenger implicated in learning and memory. The density of diaphorase-positive neurons was approximately four times higher in olfactory areas than in eulaminate areas (areas 9, 10, 12, 46, and 8), and two- to three-times higher in the agranular limbic area PAIL than in eulaminate areas. Positive neurons were concentrated in a deep band (layers V and VI), a superficial band (layers II and upper III), and were sparsely distributed in the central, thalamic recipient zone (deep layer III, layer IV and upper V). The highest densities of positive neurons were observed in the white matter where their prevalence followed the opposite trend than in the corresponding overlying cortices. The distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons was correlated with the regional anatomic and functional specialization of prefrontal cortices. Thus, diaphorase-positive neurons were most densely distributed in orbital and then medial prefrontal limbic cortices which have a low cell density and widespread connections. In contrast, positive neurons were comparatively sparse in eulaminate cortices, which have a high cell density and more restricted connections. These findings indicate that the distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons in prefrontal cortices is not random, but is associated with the structural architecture and functional attributes of these cortices. The preponderance of diaphorase-positive neurons in limbic cortices, which have been implicated in learning and memory, is consistent with the idea that nitric oxide may have a role in synaptic plasticity.",nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide; limbic cortex; memory; DMSO; dimethylsulfoxide; NADPH; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPHd; NADPH diaphorase; NO; nitric oxide; NOS; NO synthase;,

Anterograde tracers placed into the olfactory bulb labeled axons in eight primary olfactory cortical areas: the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, ventral tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, periamygdaloid cortex, and olfactory division of the entorhinal cortex. The bulbar axons terminate in the outer part of layer I throughout these areas and are most dense in areas that are close to the lateral olfactory tract. Labeled axons also were found in the superficial part of nucleus of the horizontal diagonal band. Retrograde tracers injected into the olfactory bulb labeled cells in the nucleus of the diagonal band and in all of the primary olfactory cortical areas except the olfactory tubercle. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb evoked short-latency unit responses and a characteristic field wave in the primary olfactory cortex. Multiunit activity in layer II tended to be of shorter latency than that in layer III and the endopiriform nucleus. Associational connections within the primary olfactory cortex were demonstrated with anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and the entorhinal cortex. Injections into the piriform cortex near the lateral olfactory tract labeled axons in the deep part of layer I of many primary olfactory areas, but especially in areas near the tract. An injection into the rostral entorhinal cortex, distant to the lateral olfactory tract, labeled a complementary distribution of axons in deep layer I of olfactory areas medial and caudoventral to the tract. This organization resembles that reported in the primary olfactory cortex of the rat [Luskin and Price (1983) J. Comp. Neurol. 216:264–291]. The anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and retrograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal. Cortex and rostral insula label connections from the primary olfactory cortex to nine areas in the caudal orbital cortex, including the agranular insula areas Iam, lai, Ial, Iapm, and Iapl and areas 14c, 25, 13a, and 13m. The piriform cortex projects most heavily to layer I of these areas. Only Iam, Iapm, and 13a receive a substantial projection to the deeper layers. Areas Iam, Iapm, and 13a were also the only areas that responded with multiunit action potentials to olfactory bulb stimulation in anesthetized animals. Area Iam had predominantly short-latency units, ranging from 4 to 6 msec after olfactory bulb stimulation: Area Iapm had predominantly longer latency units, with some units faithfully following the stimulus at latencies of 70–90 msec. A small region of area 13a had relatively long-latency units. These neocortical connections and electrophysiological responses establish the presence of an olfactory representatioin in the posterior orbital cortex of the macaque. Similarities in the structure and connections of the primary olfactory cortex suggest a high degree of homology between the rat and monkey and allow inferences about the process of sequential olfactory activation in the primate. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.",AN; anterior thalamic nuclei; IML; internal medullary lamina; MD; mediodorsal nuclei; MTT; mammillothalamic tract; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc; magnocellular ventral anterior nucleus; Vim; ventral intermediate nucleus; VLa; ventral lateral anterior nucleus; VLp; ventral lateral posterior nucleus; Language; Medial temporal lobe; Memory; Semantic; Thalamus;,

Visual information from the retina is relayed to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGd). The LGd then projects topographically to primary visual cortex (VISp) to mediate visual perception. In this view, the VISp is a critical network hub where visual information must traverse LGd-VISp circuits to reach higher-order ‘extrastriate’ visual cortices, which surround the VISp on its medial and lateral borders. However, decades of conflicting reports in a variety of mammals support or refute the existence of extrastriate LGd connections that can bypass the VISp. Here, we provide evidence of bidirectional extrastriate connectivity with the mouse LGd. Using small, discrete coinjections of anterograde and retrograde tracers within the thalamus and cortex, our cross-validated approach identified bidirectional thalamocortical connectivity between LGd and extrastriate visual cortices. We find robust reciprocal connectivity of the medial extrastriate regions with LGd neurons distributed along the ‘ventral strip’ border with the intergeniculate leaflet. In contrast, LGd input to lateral extrastriate regions is sparse, but lateral extrastriate regions return stronger descending projections to localized LGd areas. We show further evidence that axons from lateral extrastriate regions can overlap onto medial extrastriate-projecting LGd neurons in the ventral strip, providing a putative subcortical LGd pathway for communication between medial and lateral extrastriate regions. Overall, our findings support the existence of extrastriate LGd circuits and provide novel understanding of LGd organization in rodent visual system.","Visual, Cortex, Thalamus, Lateral Geniculate, Mouse, RRID:AB_2336656, RRID:AB_2313686, RRID:AB_2535792, RRID:AB_477329, RRID:AB_2307354, RRID:AB_141607, RRID:AB_2315777",

II. Efferent connections,"The efferent connections of the posterior hypothalamus have been analyzed autoradiographically in a series of eight cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brains with injections of 3H-amino acids in different regions of the mamillary complex and the surrounding areas. The medial mamillary nucleus was found to project through the mamillothalamic tract to the ipsilateral anteroventral, anteromedial, and interanteromedial nuclei, and by way of the mamillotegmental tract principally to the deep tegmental nucleus (of Gudden). It also appears to contribute fibers to the medial forebrain bundle, some of which reach as far rostrally as the medial septal nucleus. The lateral mamillary nucleus projects through the mamillothalamic tract bilaterally upon the anterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, and through the mamillotegmental system to the dorsal tegmental nucleus; it also appears to contribute fibers to the medial forebrain bundle. The supramamillary area has extensive ascending and descending connections that are distributed with the medial forebrain bundle to the hypothalamus and rostral midbrain; in addition, it gives rise to an unusually well-defined projection to field CA2 of the hippocampus and to a narrow zone overlying the outer part of the granule cell layer and the adjoining part of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We have not been able to distinguish the connections of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus from those of the caudal part of the lateral hypothalamic area: they both appear to contribute substantially to the ascending components of the medial forebrain bundle, and through its descending projection to the tegmental fields of the midbrain, the nucleus centralis superior of the raphe complex, the locus coeruleus, and the central gray as far caudally as the facial nerve. Their further projections to the spinal cord were not examined. Viewed broadly, and in the light of previous work, our observations confirm, once again, the constancy of the connections of the hypothalamus in the mammalian brain, and the pivotal position that the posterior hypothalamus occupies in the elaborate system of connections that links the limbic areas of the forebrain with the complex of structures that Nauta has aptly designated the “midbrain limbic region”.",,

To facilitate use with ventriculography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other noninvasive imaging techniques, the stereotaxic space is referenced to internal landmarks, viz., the anterior commissure and posterior commissure; the center of the anterior commissure at the midline is the origin of the stereotaxic axes. Reference of stereotaxis to this bicommissural space facilitates structural comparison with human brain atlases, which are commonly referenced to the biocommissural line. It also facilitates comparison of brains of different nonhuman primate species by providing a template brain against which to compare size and internal variability. Thirty-three coronal sections at 1-mm intervals from the spinomedullary junction to the rostral extreme of the caudate nucleus show most structures of the hindbrain, midbrain, and subcortical forebrain. Separately, four side views and 16 coronal sections show cortical structures. Structures are represented by outlines of their boundaries and labeled according to NeuroNames, a systematic English nomenclature of human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomy. Abbreviations are based on a protocol designed to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Instructions are provided for: (1) locating sites from the Template Atlas in the conventional stereotaxic space of an experimental animal, (2) locating sites identified by conventional stereotaxis in the Template Atlas, and (3) using the Template Atlas to collate, compare, and display image information (e.g., labeled cells, recording sites, stimulation sites, lesions) from multiple animals.",,

Magnocellular mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) supports adaptive decision-making, but its causal contribution is not well understood. Monkeys with excitotoxic MDmc damage were tested on probabilistic three-choice decision-making tasks. They could learn and track the changing values in object-reward associations, but they were severely impaired at updating choices after reversals in reward contingencies or when there were multiple options associated with reward. These deficits were not caused by perseveration or insensitivity to negative feedback though. Instead, monkeys with MDmc lesions exhibited an inability to use reward to promote choice repetition after switching to an alternative option due to a diminished influence of recent past choices and the last outcome to guide future behavior. Together, these data suggest MDmc allows for the rapid discovery and persistence with rewarding options, particularly in uncertain or changing environments. DOI:

It is divided into two main regions, the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) areas, which are in turn subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinct rostral (PMd-r and PMv-r) and caudal (PMd-c and PMv-c) sub-regions. We analyzed the callosal inputs to these premotor subdivisions following 23 injections of retrograde tracers in eight macaque monkeys. In each monkey, 2–4 distinct tracers were injected in different areas allowing direct comparisons of callosal connectivity in the same brain. Based on large injections covering the entire extent of the corresponding PM area, we found that each area is strongly connected with its counterpart in the opposite hemisphere. Callosal connectivity with the other premotor areas, the primary motor cortex, prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex varied from one area to another. The most extensive callosal inputs terminate in PMd-r and PMd-c, with PMd-r strongly connected with prefrontal cortex. Callosal inputs to PMv-c are more extensive than those to PMv-r, whose connections are restricted to its counterpart area. Quantitative analysis of labelled cells confirms these general findings, and allows an assessment of the relative strength of callosal inputs. PMd-r and PMv-r receive their strongest callosal inputs from their respective counterpart areas, whereas PMd-c and PMv-c receive strong inputs from heterotopic areas as well (namely from PMd-r and PMv-r, respectively). Finally, PMd-r stands out as the lateral premotor area with the strongest inputs from the prefrontal cortex, and only the PMd-c and PMv-c receive weak callosal inputs from M1.",,

Retrograde degeneration was studied in myelin and cresyl violet stained serial sections of whole brain specimens follwing survival of 12 to 15 months. Lesions restricted to teh insula, effectively sparing the orelying opercula, caused no retrograde degenration in thalamus. Specifically, nucleus ventralis anterior, nucleus ventralis posteromedialis pars parvocelluliaris, and nucleus ventralis posterior inferior were normal. Lesions which involved orbitofrontal cortex produced the expected degeneration of the ventral division of paralamellar nucleus medialis dorsalis (medialis dorsalis pars multiformis). Surprisingly, minimal but unequivocal degeneration was seen in this nucleus when lesiions were restricted to the superior temporal plane; it was more marked when the parietal operculum was included in the lesion. With destruction of the white matter of the parietal or frontal operculum, degeneration was apparent surrounding the centrum medianum, most conspicuously in ventral paralamellar medialis dorsalis and parvocelular nucleus ventralis posteromedialis. Increased gliosis without nerve cell destruction in the basomedial part of nucleus ventralis anterior was present in two specimens with anterior insular ablatioins presumably as the result of interruption of cortico-thalamic projections from orbitofrontal cortex.",,

While Aggleton and Brown (1999) suggested a role for recognition and not recall, Van der Werf et al. (2003) suggested that this nucleus is functionally related to executive function and strategic retrieval, based on its connections to the prefrontal cortices (PFC). The present study used a lesion approach including patients with focal thalamic lesions to examine the functions of the MD, the intralaminar nuclei and the midline nuclei in memory processing. A newly designed pair association task was used, which allowed the assessment of recognition and cued recall performance. Volume loss in thalamic nuclei was estimated as a predictor for alterations in memory performance. Patients performed poorer than healthy controls on recognition accuracy and cued recall. Furthermore, patients responded slower than controls specifically on recognition trials followed by successful cued recall of the paired associate. Reduced recall of picture pairs and increased response times during recognition followed by cued recall covaried with the volume loss in the parvocellular MD. This pattern suggests a role of this thalamic region in recall and thus recollection, which does not fit the framework proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). The functional specialization of the parvocellular MD accords with its connectivity to the dorsolateral PFC, highlighting the role of this thalamocortical network in explicit memory (Van der Werf et al., 2003).",Thalamus; Ischemia; Recognition memory; Recall; Recollection; Mediodorsal nucleus;,

How the cerebellum fulfills this role at a neuronal level remains unknown. It is likely that the cerebellum exerts the same effect on a number of different efferent targets. In order to influence voluntary movement, a major output from the cerebellum projects to the motor cortex via the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. By examining neuronal activity in the cerebellar thalamus, and comparing this with activity recorded from its connections with the deep cerebellar nuclei and motor cortex, conclusions can be made regarding cerebellar function. Current data does not support a role for the CTC pathway in the initiation of movement or the control of trans-cortical reflexes. Also, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that the cerebellum prevents terminal movement oscillations by predictively sending a message to the antagonist muscle to brake the movement. The available literature supports the Eccles theory that during normal movement, the CTC pathway receives a form of efference copy from the motor cortex and compares this message with that derived from peripheral afferents about the actual progress of the movement. However, there is not a significant degree of kinematic information passing through this pathway in the course of a voluntary movement. Therefore the actual site of comparison or error-detection in this system awaits further elucidation.",,

The sub-regions of Broca’s area (pars triangularis, pars opercularis) presumably are connected via corticocortical pathways. However, growing evidence suggests that the thalamus may also be involved in language and share some of the linguistic functions supported by Broca’s area. Functional connectivity is thought to be achieved via corticothalamic/thalamocortical white matter pathways. Our study investigates structural connectivity between Broca’s area and the thalamus, specifically ventral anterior nucleus and pulvinar. We demonstrate that Broca’s area shares direct connections with these thalamic nuclei and suggest a local Broca’s area—thalamus network potentially involved in linguistic processing. Thalamic connectivity with Broca’s area may serve to selectively recruit cortical regions storing multimodal features of lexical items and to bind them together during lexical–semantic processing. In addition, Broca’s area—thalamic circuitry may enable cortico–thalamo–cortical information transfer and modulation between BA 44 and 45 during language comprehension and production.",Broca’s area; Thalamus; Ventral anterior nucleus; Pulvinar; White matter; Tractography; Language;,

Old World and New World monkeys received small unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase. These labeled cells in a number of cortical, thalamic, and brainstem regions and in a few further telencephalic and diencephalic regions. Cortically, the neighboring areas of the inferior and superior temporal gyrus and the insula contained a considerable number of labeled cells. Furthermore, a substantial projection arose from the orbitofrontal and the frontopolar cortex. The cingulate gyrus contained only very few labeled cells. Interhemispherically, corticocortical connections arose mainly from temporal lobe areas. Labeled cells were seen in various regions of the basal forebrain and cells labeled only faintly in the lateral and basal accessory nuclei of the amygdala. The claustrum contained labeled neurons only in one rhesus monkey. On the diencephalic level, the caudal medial portion of the medial pulvinar was the principal thalamic source of afferents to the temporopolar cortex. Furthermore, labeled cells were found in the neighboring, caudal part of the mediodorsal nucleus, within and along the nucleus limitans, in the medial geniculate nucleus, and in several nuclei of the nonspecific system. The fields of Forel, the zona incerta, and lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamic areas contained a few labeled cells. Within the brainstem of the rhesus monkeys those regions projecting diffusely to the cortex contained a few labeled neurons. Furthermore, these brains had some labeled cells in the regions of the nuclei medialis annuli aqueductus, tractus mesencephalicus nervi trigemini, and trochlearis. Although among the three species differences in the cortical and thalamic projection patterns were observed, the regions projecting most densely to the temporal pole were similar in principle. This statement holds in particular for cortical and thalamic sites. However, the greatest number of labeled cells was found in the rhesus monkey, a fact that cannot be attributed solely to the size of the horseradish peroxidase injections and the size of the brain, but that appears rather to represent a true species difference. From our results we conclude that the temporopolar cortex constitutes a cortical area necessary for effective affectional-sensory integration.",,

Evoked unitary discharges were routinely recorded from the external segment of the ventrobasal complex in these animals following stimulation of discrete portions of the body. Evidence was obtained which indicated that this spinothalamic projection is somatotopically organized with reference to the body surface. Other thalamic nuclei from which evoked responses were recorded included cell groups of internal medullary lamina and the centrum medianum. Unitary potentials or multiunit recordings from these other responsive zones were found to be evoked by inputs stemming from large, frequently bilateral areas of the body. In addition, nuclei were also shown to respond which were homologous to some of those comprising the posterior nuclear group in cat. The active points in the posterior region also did not show a somatotopic arrangement of the ventrobasal type and were initiated by stimulation of bilateral peripheral inputs. In two instances, responses were also recorded in the external medullary lamina. These results indicate that the spinothalamic systems of monkey are comprised of pathways through which an area to point relationship exists between the opposite side of the body and the ventrobasal complex, and of diffuse projections which carry input from wide areas of body surface to nuclei adjacent to the ventrobasal complex.",,

The epithalamus (paraventricular complex, habenular complex, and the pretectal group of nuclei) is entirely independent of the endbrain in all mammals and undergoes a strong reduction in higher forms. The dorsal thalamus is entirely dependent on the endbrain. Each nucleus of this division has a restricted projection upon the endbrain without which it cannot survive. The dorsal thalamic nuclei are classified as extrinsic or intrinsic depending on whether or not they receive a substantial portion of their afferents from extra-thalamic sources. It can be shown that the neocortex of primitive mammals consists largely of projection areas of extrinsic thalamic nuclei (primary cortical areas), whereas in the neocortex of higher forms the projection areas (secondary cortical areas) of the intrinsic thalamic nuclei become dominant. The intrinsic thalamic nuclei are separable into two groups. Those projecting upon the neocortex become dominant in primates, whereas the intrinsic nuclei projecting upon the rhinecephalic structures are, on the whole, best developed in macrosmatic mammals. The ventral thalamus consists of one subdivision (ventral lateral geniculate body) entirely independent of the endbrain, and of a second subdivision (reticular complex) which projects upon a large number of cortical fields. The sparse and generalized — though spatially well organized — projection of the reticular complex provides a system apparently independent of the dorsal thalamic projections and capable, presumably, of evoking generalized cortical activity.",,

Based on the somatotopical map prepared by intracortical microstimulation, injections of the anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, were made into the following motor-related areas: the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex, and the frontal eye field. Data obtained from the present experiments were as follows: (i) Corticotegmental inputs from orofacial, forelimb, and hindlimb representations of the primary motor cortex tended to be arranged orderly from medial to lateral in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. However, the distribution areas of these inputs considerably overlapped; (ii) The major input zones from distal representations of the forelimb and hindlimb regions of the primary motor cortex were located medial to those from their proximal representations, although there was a substantial overlap between the distribution areas of distal versus proximal limb inputs; (iii) The main terminal zones from the forelimb regions of the primary motor cortex, the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas, and the dorsal and ventral divisions of the premotor cortex appeared to overlap largely in the mediolaterally middle aspect of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus; and (iv) Corticotegmental input from the frontal eye field was scattered over the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus, the present results indicate that the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus is likely to receive partly separate but essentially convergent cortical inputs not only from multiple motor-related areas representing the same body part, but also from multiple regions representing diverse body parts. This suggests that somatotopical representations are intermingled rather than segregated in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus.","primary motor cortex; supplementary motor area; presupplementary motor area; premotor cortex; frontal eye field; motor control; ABC, avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex; BDA, biotinylated dextran amine; FEF, frontal eye field; GPi, internal segment of the globus pallidus; ICMS, intracortical microstimulation; MI, primary motor cortex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMd, dorsal division of the premotor cortex; PMv, ventral division of the premotor cortex; PPN, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus; pre-SMA, presupplementary motor area; SMA, supplementary motor area; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr, substantia nigra pars reticulata; STN, subthalamic nucleus; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; WGA-HRP, wheat germ agglutinin–conjugated horseradish peroxidase;",

The pattern of anatomical connections from the primate auditory cortex to the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal lobes suggests a possible division into dorsal and ventral auditory processing streams, with the dorsal stream originating from more caudal areas of the auditory cortex, and the ventral stream originating from more rostral areas. These streams are hypothesized to be analogous to the well-established dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In the visual system, the dorsal processing stream shows substantially faster neural response latencies than does the ventral stream. However, the relative timing of putative dorsal and ventral stream processing has yet to be explored in other sensory modalities. Here, we compare distributions of neural response latencies from 10 different areas of macaque auditory cortex, confirmed by individual anatomical reconstructions, to determine whether a similar timing advantage is found for the hypothesized dorsal auditory stream. Across three varieties of auditory stimuli (clicks, noise, and pure tones), we find that latencies increase with hierarchical level, as predicted by anatomical connectivity. Critically, we also find a pronounced timing differential along the caudal-to-rostral axis within the same hierarchical level, with caudal (dorsal stream) latencies being faster than rostral (ventral stream) latencies. This observed timing differential mirrors that found for the dorsal stream of the visual system, suggestive of a common timing advantage for the dorsal stream across sensory modalities.","systems neuroscience, neurophysiology, hierarchy",

Outputs from the cerebellum and basal ganglia supply three systems of subcortical afferents to the ventrolateral thalamus. These systems form parallel pathways to motor and premotor cortical areas. One parallel pathway originates in the caudal portions of the deep cerebellar nuclei and most directly influences the APA. A second pathway originates in SNpr and GPi and most directly influences the SMA. The third pathway originates in rostral portions of the deep cerebellar nuclei and most directly influences the motor cortex. Thus, each cortical area is the site of termination for a distinct subcortical system. Direct interactions between the three systems are largely limited to the cortical level, where the SMA, APA, and motor cortex are reciprocally interconnected with one another. In the chapter, the results suggest that the premotor areas may provide a major route by which subcortical motor nuclei influence motor cortex output. The anatomical relationship between the basal ganglia and the SMA suggests that some of the movement disorders associated with basal ganglia dysfunction might be mediated by the SMA. The anatomical relationship between the cerebellum and the APA suggests the possibility of cerebellar involvement in the motor functions of the frontal lobe. Frontal lobe lesions in humans, in the region comparable to the APA, can result in a complex disorder of learned skilled movements termed “apraxia.”",,

Cholinergic dysfunction is thought to underpin several key symptoms. There is known pathologic involvement of the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loops in PSP, but little attention has been focused on potential thalamic dysfunction. Using autoradiography, we measured muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors in specific thalamic nuclei involved in the limbic and motor loops in patients with PSP (n = 11) and compared results from brain tissue of subjects with Lewy body dementias (including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 31), Alzheimer disease (n = 22) and normal elderly control subjects (n = 27). In the thalamus M2 receptors were more abundant than M4 receptors and were most densely concentrated in the anteroprincipal (AP) and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, which connect to limbic cortices. M2 receptor binding was reduced in the AP nucleus in PSP compared with control subjects and those with Lewy body dementias. M4 receptors were markedly reduced in the MD nucleus in those with PSP compared with control subjects. M4 receptors were also reduced in the subthalamic nucleus in patients with PSP. M4 receptor binding was reduced in the MD nucleus in the Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease groups compared with control subjects. There were no significant changes in the ventrolateral nucleus (motor).

To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates. In addition, these results provide further evidence for proposed subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar. J. Comp. Neurol. 396:381–398, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Previous studies have indicated that certain cortical areas may project across multiple thalamic nuclei, potentially allowing them to modulate distributed information flow. However, there is a lack of quantitative investigations into anatomical connectivity patterns within the thalamus. Consequently, it remains unknown if cortical areas exhibit differences in the spread of their thalamic connectivity patterns. To address this knowledge gap, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to compute brain-wide probabilistic tractography using data from 828 healthy adults collected by the Human Connectome Project. To measure the spatial extent of anatomical connectivity patterns within the thalamus, we developed an innovative framework that quantifies the spatial properties of each cortical area’s within-thalamus connectivity patterns. We then leveraged resting-state functional MRI, cortical myelin, and human neural gene expression data to test if the spread of within-thalamus connectivity patterns varied along the cortical hierarchy. These results revealed two broad cortico-thalamic tractography motifs: 1) a sensorimotor cortical motif characterized by focal thalamic connections targeting posterolateral thalamus, which potentially supports fast, feed-forward information flow; and 2) an associative cortical motif characterized by diffuse thalamic connections targeting anteromedial thalamus, which potentially supports slower, feed-back information flow. These results were consistent among human subjects and were also observed in macaques, indicating cross-species generalizability. In summary, these findings demonstrate that sensorimotor and association cortical areas exhibit differences in the spatial extent of their within-thalamus connectivity patterns, which may support functionally-distinct cortico-thalamic information transmission.",,

Thalamocortical connections of the caudal superior temporal plane","Recent studies of macaque monkey auditory cortex have revealed convergent auditory and somatosensory activity in the caudomedial area (CM) of the belt region. In the present study and its companion (Smiley et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [this issue]), neuroanatomical tracers were injected into CM and adjacent areas of the superior temporal plane to identify sources of auditory and somatosensory input to this region. Other than CM, target areas included: A1, caudolateral belt (CL), retroinsular (Ri), and temporal parietotemporal (Tpt). Cells labeled by injections of these areas were distributed mainly among the ventral (MGv), posterodorsal (MGpd), anterodorsal (MGad), and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC) and several nuclei with established multisensory features: posterior (Po), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM). The principal inputs of CM were MGad, MGv, and MGm, with secondary inputs from multisensory nuclei. The main inputs of CL were Po and MGpd, with secondary inputs from MGad, MGm, and multisensory nuclei. A1 was dominated by inputs from MGv and MGad, with light multisensory inputs. The input profile of Tpt closely resembled that of CL, but with reduced MGC inputs. Injections of Ri also involved CM but strongly favored MGm and multisensory nuclei, with secondary inputs from MGC and the inferior division (VPI) of the ventroposterior complex (VP). The results indicate that the thalamic inputs of areas in the caudal superior temporal plane arise mainly from the same nuclei, but in different proportions. Somatosensory inputs may reach CM and CL through MGm or the multisensory nuclei but not VP. J. Comp. Neurol. 502:924–952, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Furthermore, a dense accumulation of VP fibers was observed in areas such as the DBB, medial septum, BST, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, periaquaductal gray, dorsal and ventral raphe, area of Forel, LC region, parabrachial nuclei, and NTS. The lateral septum and lateral habenula displayed no and very few VP fibers, respectively. No extrahypothalamic OXT neurons were found in the brain of this macaque monkey. Dense concentrations of OXT fibers were demonstrated in the amygdala, NTS and marginal layer of the cervical spinal cord. No sexual dimorphism was found in this primate VP or OXT system. The results show a distribution of the central VP and OXT systems in this primate which is quite different from that in the rat. However, in various aspects it agrees with current data on the VP and OXT systems of the human brain. The present results suggest, therefore, that this monkey might serve as a better model for the human VP system than the rat.",,

We provide in vivo evidence for connectivity between the SC and the amygdala via the pulvinar in both humans and rhesus macaques. Probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging tractography revealed a streamlined path that passes dorsolaterally through the pulvinar before arcing rostrally to traverse above the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle and connect to the lateral amygdala. To obviate artifactual connectivity with crossing fibers of the stria terminalis, the stria was also dissected. The putative streamline between the SC and amygdala traverses above the temporal horn dorsal to the stria terminalis and is positioned medial to it in humans and lateral to it in monkeys. The topography of the streamline was examined in relation to lesion anatomy in five patients who had previously participated in behavioral experiments studying the processing of emotionally valenced visual stimuli. The pulvinar lesion interrupted the streamline in two patients who had exhibited contralesional processing deficits and spared the streamline in three patients who had no deficit. Although not definitive, this evidence supports the existence of a subcortical pathway linking the SC with the amygdala in primates. It also provides a necessary bridge between behavioral data obtained in future studies of neurological patients, and any forthcoming evidence from more invasive techniques, such as anatomical tracing studies and electrophysiological investigations only possible in nonhuman species.","threat, DTI tractography, superior colliculus, pulvinar, amygdala",

Similarly, the sources of afferents to the oculomotor and skeletomotor cortical areas are separated in the thalamus. Whereas, the frontal eye field receives its projections from an external crescent of nucleus medialis dorsalis, the motor and premotor strips receive theirs from several nuclei of the ventrolateral. The separation is accented by the interposition of a thick fiber layer: the thalamic internal medullary lamina or IML. This chapter discusses the evidence based on stimulation, lesion, and unit recording experiments that intralaminar cells in the central thalamus are playing a role in gaze shifts and gaze fixation. Guided by the known anatomy of this region and by assumptions on the ultimate destination of the neural signals recorded there, one shall examine how these signals can be utilized.

The lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus also projects to V1 but this input is little understood. We manipulated lateral pulvinar neural activity and assessed the effect on supra-granular layers of V1 that project to higher visual cortex. Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased 4-fold the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields towards the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations. Excitation of lateral pulvinar after LGN lesion activated supra-granular layer V1 neurons. Thus, lateral pulvinar is able to powerfully control and gate information outflow from V1.",,

In order to determine whether the DA innervation of the primate MD shares the anatomical features of the mesocortical or nigrostriatal DA projections, we performed tract-tracing and immunocytochemistry studies in macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to identify the location of the DA neurons that project to MD and immuno-electron microscopy to determine the distribution of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in axons within the MD. Similar to the mesocortical projection, retrogradely-labeled, tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons were present in dorsal tier ventral mesencephalic nuclei, such as the ventral tegmental area and the dorsal portion of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, no dual-labeled neurons were present in the ventral tier nuclei, the primary origin of the nigrostriatal DA pathway. In addition, like the DA projection to the prefrontal cortex, DAT immunoreactivity was predominantly localized to the pre-terminal portion of axons in the MD, and was infrequently found in association with synaptic vesicles, in contrast to nigrostriatal DA axons. These findings indicate that the DA projection to the MD shares anatomical features with the mesocortical DA system, suggesting that the functional properties of DA neurotransmission in the MD might be more similar to those in the cortex than in the striatum.",dopamine transporter; tyrosine hydroxylase; prefrontal cortex; ventral mesencephalon; COMT; catechol-O-methyltransferase; CTb; cholera toxin b subunit; DA; dopamine; DAT; dopamine transporter; IR; immunoreactive; MD; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; PB; phosphate buffer; TH; tyrosine hydroxylase;,

Parabrachiofugal fibers ascended to the forebrain along three pathways: the central tegmental tract, the ventral ascending catecholaminergic pathway, and a pathway located on the midline between the medial longitudinal fasciculi. The PBN projected heavily to the central nucleus of the amygdala and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and moderately to the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra. Light terminal label also was present within the dorsomedial, ventromedial, lateral, supramammillary, and infundibular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the annular nucleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus within the brain stem. The overall pattern of terminal label was similar to that previously reported for nonprimate species, but several differences were notable. In monkey the projection to the ventrobasal thalamus did not coincide with the region that contains gustatory-responsive neurons. In rats, these parabrachiothalamic fibers convey gustatory activity but in the monkey these fibers may carry visceral afferent information.

The goal of the present study was to establish in monkeys whether these subdivisions also differ with regard to their callosal connectivity. Two fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected in each animal, one in the pre-SMA and the second in the SMA-proper. Tracer injections in the pre-SMA or in SMA-proper resulted in significant numbers of labeled neurons in the opposite SMA, premotor cortex (PM), cingulate motor areas (CMA), and cingulate gyrus. Labeled neurons in M1 were rare, being observed only after injection in the SMA-proper. The two subdivisions of the SMA differed in the proportion of labeled neurons found across areas providing their callosal inputs. The SMA-proper receives about half of its callosal inputs from its counterpart in the other hemisphere (42–65% across monkeys). A comparable proportion of neurons was found in the pre-SMA after injection in the opposite pre-SMA (32–47%). The pre-SMA receives more callosal inputs from the rostral halves of the dorsal PM, the ventral PM, and the CMA than from their caudal halves. In addition, the pre-SMA, but not the SMA-proper, receives callosal inputs from the prefrontal cortex. The SMA-proper receives more callosal inputs from the caudal halves of the dorsal PM and ventral PM than from their rostral halves. The two subdivisions of the SMA receive callosal inputs from the same cortical areas (except the prefrontal cortex and M1), but they differ with respect to the quantitative contribution of each area of origin. In conclusion, quantitative data now support the notion that pre-SMA receives more transcallosal inputs than the SMA-proper. J. Comp. Neurol. 443:71–85, 2002. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Neurons related to the task were found in the thalamic motor regions VLo, VPLo, and VA where microstimulation occasionally elicited motor reactions in hand and fingers. 58% of these 55 neurons, designated “typical”, showed modulation of their discharge patterns with force similar to neurons in precentral cortex and could be assigned to one of 5 discharge patterns described for the motor cortex. Only a small percentage of the thalamic neurons were found to have phasic activity. The other “atypical” neurons (42%) had discharge patterns with complex sequences of phasic and tonic activation with respect to force. For 18 typical and atypical neurons with tonic and phasic-tonic modulation of their firing rate with force significant regression coefficients between firing rate and static force were observed. The mean index of force sensitivity (rateforce slope) was 54.5 Hz/N for the neurons increasing their discharge rate with force, i.e. approximately that of precentral cells. Neurons tested for their sensory properties had receptive fields located on hand and/or fingers and were activated mainly by stimulation of muscle and joint receptors. The characteristics of these thalamic neurons are compared to those of precentral cells recorded under identical experimental conditions and are discussed in relation to the known input-output relationships of the motor thalamic nuclei. The data strongly support the hypothesis that parameters of movement, in particular force, are represented by the activity of neurons in the “motor” thalamus.",,

Although the two receptor subtypes show a markedly different distribution in the rat brain, their distribution in the primate brain has not been described previously. In this study, the neuroanatomic distribution of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor binding sites in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was assessed by using iodine 125 ([125I)-Tyr0]-sauvagine with or without the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP-154,526–1. Radiolabeled human cRNA probes were used to map the distribution of the two receptor mRNAs with in situ hybridization. Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were found in the pituitary and throughout the neocortex (especially, in prefrontal, cingulate, striate, and insular cortices), amygdala, and hippocampal formation of the monkey brain. This is in contrast to the distribution of these receptors reported in the rat brain, in which generally only the CRF1 receptor is found in the pituitary and neocortex. These results suggest that, in primates, both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of CRF on cognition, behavior, and pituitary-adrenal function. The presence of CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptors within the locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamus, and striatum and of CRF2 (but not CRF1) receptors in the choroid plexus, certain hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus prepositus, and the nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests that each receptor subtype also may have distinct functional roles within the primate central nervous system.

Dysfunction of the CT, typically a result of severe brain injury (SBI), leads to long-lasting impairments in arousal regulation and subsequent deficits in cognition. Central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) is proposed as a therapy to reestablish and maintain arousal regulation to improve cognition in select SBI patients. However, a mechanistic understanding of CT-DBS and an optimal method of implementing this promising therapy are unknown. Here we demonstrate in two healthy nonhuman primates (NHPs), Macaca mulatta, that location-specific CT-DBS improves performance in visuomotor tasks and is associated with physiological effects consistent with enhancement of endogenous arousal. Specifically, CT-DBS within the lateral wing of the central lateral nucleus and the surrounding medial dorsal thalamic tegmental tract (DTTm) produces a rapid and robust modulation of performance and arousal, as measured by neuronal activity in the frontal cortex and striatum. Notably, the most robust and reliable behavioral and physiological responses resulted when we implemented a novel method of CT-DBS that orients and shapes the electric field within the DTTm using spatially separated DBS leads. Collectively, our results demonstrate that selective activation within the DTTm of the CT robustly regulates endogenous arousal and enhances cognitive performance in the intact NHP; these findings provide insights into the mechanism of CT-DBS and further support the development of CT-DBS as a therapy for reestablishing arousal regulation to support cognition in SBI patients.","central thalamus, deep brain stimulation, arousal regulation, intralaminar nuclei, severe brain injury",

However, following the delivery of retrograde tracers into the ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamic nuclei, a moderate number of labeled neurons were found within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in control cases, MPTP-treated monkeys and animals with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Furthermore, dual tracing experiments showed that subthalamo-thalamic and subthalamo-pallidal projections arise from different subpopulations of STN efferent neurons. Moreover, upregulated expression of the mRNA coding the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) was found in retrogradely-labeled STN neurons in MPTP-treated monkeys. By contrast, there is a reduction in vGlut2 mRNA expression in subthalamo-thalamic neurons in dyskinetic monkeys. In conclusion, our findings support the presence of a direct projection from the STN to the ventral thalamus that appears to be functionally modulated by dopaminergic activity.",,

The present study provides evidence that these and related thalamic subdivisions can be identified histochemically by their differing contents of acetylthiocholinesterase. The brains of fifty cats were prepared for acetylthiocholinesterase histochemistry by the methods of Geneser-Jensen & Blackstad and Karnovsky & Roots. Serial sections were cut in each of the three Horsley-Clarke planes and a standard transverse cholinesterase series, containing occasional reference sections stained for myelin or Nissl substance, was used to assemble graphic reconstructions of the main cholinesterase subdivisions. Patterns of afferent connections were visualized by anterograde axon transport or fiber-degeneration techniques and recorded in thirteen sets of detailed chartings. In nine sets, serially adjoining sections processed by the cholinesterase and anterograde methods were directly compared and plotted together. The caudal part of the lateral thalamic region was divided into two main subdivisions: the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex, which receives extrageniculate visual input, and the complex comprising the nuclei lateralis medialis and suprageniculatus (LM-Sg), which receives fiber projections from auditory association cortex and the deep layers of the superior colliculus. The latter complex occupies a ventromedial zone alongside the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex. It is distinguished in the cholinesterase stain by prominent 0.5–1.5 mm wide patches of high enzyme activity that appear against a pale background. Within the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex, three zones could be distinguished:
(1) the medial part of the nucleus lateralis posterior (LPm) is rich in cholinesterase activity and receives input from the superficial collicular layers;
(2) the lateral part of the nucleus lateralis posterior and the nucleus posterior of Rioch (LP1-NP) have much weaker cholinesterase activity and receive input from the striate cortex and other areas of visual cortex;
(3) the pulvinar, the most lateral of the subdivisions, is a zone of high cholinesterase activity in which some pale patches appear. It receives input from the pretectum and is associated with a differentiated lateral marginal zone receiving direct projections from the retina and area 17. (1) the medial part of the nucleus lateralis posterior (LPm) is rich in cholinesterase activity and receives input from the superficial collicular layers; (2) the lateral part of the nucleus lateralis posterior and the nucleus posterior of Rioch (LP1-NP) have much weaker cholinesterase activity and receive input from the striate cortex and other areas of visual cortex; (3) the pulvinar, the most lateral of the subdivisions, is a zone of high cholinesterase activity in which some pale patches appear. It receives input from the pretectum and is associated with a differentiated lateral marginal zone receiving direct projections from the retina and area 17. The intermediate nucleus of the lateral group was divided into two parts. The pars caudalis (LIc) has a mottled appearance in the cholinesterase stain; it receives an ascending input from the pretectotectal border zone and a descending projection from parietal cortex including area 7. The pars oralis of the intermediate nucleus (LIo) is rich in cholinesterase activity; it receives a descending projection from the anterior parietal cortex comprising in part area 5. These two intermediate subdivisions were flanked dorsally and rostrally by the nucleus lateralis dorsalis. The cholinesterase material suggested a division of the lateralis dorsalis into at least medial and lateral parts, but the connections of these regions were not analyzed in detail. The finding of clear chemoarchitectural subdivisions in the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex and adjoining regions has practical significance as a guide to thalamic organization and raises the possibility that some extrageniculate and related transthalamic pathways may be differentiated from one another by the neurotransmitters they employ in the thalamus.",HRP; horseradish peroxidase; LD; nucleus lateralis dorsalis; LI; nucleus lateralis intermedius; LIc; pars caudalis; LIo; pars oralis; LM; nucleus lateralis medialis; LP; lateralis posterior; LP1; pars lateralis; LPm; pars medialis; NP; nucleus posterior of Rioch; Sg; suprageniculate nucleus;,

However, because MDmc receives input from structures in addition to the amygdala and MDmc projects to areas in addition to pOFC, it is unknown whether amygdalar pathways in MDmc innervate pOFC-bound neurons. We addressed this issue using double- or triple-labeling approaches to identify pathways and key cellular and molecular features in rhesus monkeys. We found that amygdalar terminations innervated labeled neurons in MDmc that project to pOFC. Projection neurons in MDmc directed to pOFC included comparatively fewer “core” parvalbumin neurons that project focally to the middle cortical layers and more “matrix” calbindin neurons that project expansively to the upper cortical layers. In addition, a small and hitherto unknown pathway originated from MDmc calretinin neurons and projected to pOFC. Further, whereas projection neurons directed to MDmc and to pOFC were intermingled in the amygdala, none projected to both structures. Larger amygdalar neurons projected to MDmc and expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is found in highly efficient “driver” pathways. In contrast, smaller amygdalar neurons directed to pOFC expressed VGLUT1 found in modulatory pathways. The indirect pathway from the amygdala to pOFC via MDmc may provide information about the emotional significance of events and, along with a parallel direct pathway, ensures transfer of signals to all layers of pOFC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The amygdala—the brain's center for emotions—is strongly linked with the orbital cortex, a region associated with social interactions. This study provides evidence that a robust pathway from the amygdala reaches neurons in the thalamus that link directly with the orbital cortex, forming a tight tripartite network. The dual pathways from the amygdala to the orbital cortex and to the thalamus are distinct by morphology, neurochemistry, and function. This tightly linked network suggests the presence of fool-proof avenues for emotions to influence high-order cortical areas associated with affective reasoning. Specific nodes of this tripartite network are disrupted in psychiatric diseases, divorcing areas that integrate emotions and thoughts for decisions and flexible behavior.","amygdala, emotion, orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, primate, thalamus",

Under continuously maintained ketamine anesthesia, the receptive fields of a total of 192 single units were recorded from the right VP thalamus using 2 MΩ glass microelectrodes. After the receptive fields were mapped, the brains were reacted for CO histochemistry on 50-μm coronal frozen sections through the entire VP thalamus. The majority of units were localized to the CO-reactive regions that define the medial and lateral divisions of VP (VPm and VPl). Apart from the expected finding of the face being represented in VPm and the body in VPl, reconstructing the electrode tracks and unit locations in the histological sections revealed a general association between discrete regions of CO reactivity and the representation of specific body regions. Some low-threshold cutaneous units were apparently localized to VPi (the CO weak regions dorsal, ventral, and interdigitating with, the CO regions of VP). These VPi units were clearly part of the same representational map as the VPl and VPm units. We conclude that the low-threshold cutaneous receptive fields of the marmoset are organized in a single continuous representation of the contralateral body surface, and that this representation can most simply be interpreted as being folded or crumpled into the three-dimensional space of VP thalamus. The folded nature of the body map in VP may be related to the folded nature of VP as revealed by CO histochemistry.",,

It is centrally placed on a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network connecting the primary motor cortex, to the dentate nucleus of the contralateral cerebellum through the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT). The VIM is not readily visible on conventional MR imaging, so identifying the surgical target traditionally involved indirect targeting that relies on atlas-defined coordinates. Unfortunately, this approach does not fully account for individual variability and requires surgery to be performed with the patient awake to allow for intraoperative targeting confirmation. The aim of this study is to identify the VIM and the DRT using probabilistic tractography in patients that will undergo thalamic DBS for tremor. Four male patients with tremor dominant PD and five patients (three female) with ET underwent high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) (128 diffusion directions, 1.5 mm isotropic voxels and b value = 1500) preoperatively. Patients received VIM-DBS using an MR image guided and MR image verified approach with indirect targeting. Postoperatively, using parallel Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) processing, thalamic areas with the highest diffusion connectivity to the primary motor area (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory area (S1) and contralateral dentate nucleus were identified. Additionally, volume of tissue activation (VTA) corresponding to active DBS contacts were modelled. Response to treatment was defined as 40% reduction in the total Fahn-Tolosa-Martin Tremor Rating Score (FTMTRS) with DBS-ON, one year from surgery. Three out of nine patients had a suboptimal, long-term response to treatment. The segmented thalamic areas corresponded well to anatomically known counterparts in the ventrolateral (VL) and ventroposterior (VP) thalamus. The dentate-thalamic area, lay within the M1-thalamic area in a ventral and lateral location. Streamlines corresponding to the DRT connected M1 to the contralateral dentate nucleus via the dentate-thalamic area, clearly crossing the midline in the mesencephalon. Good response was seen when the active contact VTA was in the thalamic area with highest connectivity to the contralateral dentate nucleus. Non-responders had active contact VTAs outside the dentate-thalamic area. We conclude that probabilistic tractography techniques can be used to segment the VL and VP thalamus based on cortical and cerebellar connectivity. The thalamic area, best representing the VIM, is connected to the contralateral dentate cerebellar nucleus. Connectivity based segmentation of the VIM can be achieved in individual patients in a clinically feasible timescale, using HARDI and high performance computing with parallel GPU processing. This same technique can map out the DRT tract with clear mesencephalic crossing.","Diffusion weighted imaging, DWI, Connectivity, Parkinson's disease, PD, Ventrointermedialis, VIM, Dentato-rubro-thalamic tract, DRT, Ventrolateral nucleus, VL, Dentate nucleus, Tremor, Deep brain stimulation, DBS",

Labeled neurons were found in layers 3, 5 and 6 of areas 24c and 23c and were heaviest following injections placed in M2. Projections to analogous somatotopic areas in M1 and M2 arose from similar cingulate regions. In area 24c, neurons projecting to the face area of M1 and M2 were located anteriorly, those to the hindlimb were located posteriorly, and neurons projecting to the forelimb area of M1 and M2 were located in between. In area 23c, neurons projecting to the forelimb area of M1 and M2 were located anteriorly and those to the hindlimb area of M1 and M2 were located posteriorly. The face area of M1 and M2 was not found to receive afferents from area 23c. In contrast to this discreteness, cingulate projections to Woolsey's axial representation of M1 were diffuse. The results support the presence of a separate and somatotopically organized cingulate motor cortex in area 24c. This is predicated on the facts that: (1) small injections of retrograde tracers placed in analogous somatotopic parts of M1 and M2 resulted in similar patterns of labeling within the electrophysiologically “excitable” portion of the anterior cingulate cortex, and (2) this organized topography infers somatotopy. Our data fail to support a somatotopically organized cingulate motor area in area 23c if the criterion of all body parts is demanded. By virtue of its anatomical location and its connectional relation to the spinal cord and isocortical motor fields on the one hand and to the limbic cortex on the other, area 24c may be considered as M3 and provide limbic influences at several levels of motor control. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Motor abnormalities are also a common feature of psychiatric illness. Several subcortical limbic-motor entry points have been defined in recent years, but cortical entry points are understood poorly, despite the fact that a part of the limbic lobe, the cingulate motor cortex (area 24c or M3, and area 23c or M4), contributes axons to the corticospinal pathway. Using retrograde and anterograde tracers in rhesus monkeys, we investigated the ipsilateral limbic input to area 24c and adjacent area 23c. Limbic cortical input to areas 24c and 23c arise from cingulate areas 24a, 24b, 23a, 23b, and 32, retrosplenial areas 30 and 29, and temporal areas 35, TF and TH. Areas 24c and 23c were also interconnected strongly. The dysgranular part of the orbitofrontal cortex and insula projects primarily to area 24c while the granular part of the orbitofrontal cortex and insula projects primarily to area 23c. Afferents from cingulate area 25, the retrocalcarine cortex, temporal pole, entorhinal cortex, parasubiculum, and the medial part of area TH target primarily or only area 24c. Our findings indicate that a variety of telencephalic limbic afferents converge on cortex lining the lower bank and fundus of the anterior part of the cingulate sulcus. Because it is known that this cortex gives rise to axons ending in the spinal cord, facial nucleus, pontine gray, red nucleus, putamen, and primary and supplementary motor cortices, we suggest that the cingulate motor cortex forms a strategic cortical entry point for limbic influence on the voluntary motor system.",Cingulate gyrus; Non-human primate; Limbic system;,

Our study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the perceptual parsing and grouping of complex repeating auditory patterns that occur based solely on statistical regularities, or context. Human psychophysical studies suggest that the recognition of novel auditory patterns amid a continuous auditory stimulus sequence occurs automatically halfway through the first repetition. We hypothesized that once repeating patterns were detected by the brain, internal rhythms would become entrained, demarcating the temporal structure of these repetitions despite lacking external cues defining pattern on- or offsets. To examine the neural correlates of pattern perception, neuroelectric activity of primary auditory cortex (A1) and thalamic nuclei was recorded while nonhuman primates passively listened to streams of rapidly presented pure tones and bandpass noise bursts. At arbitrary intervals, random acoustic patterns composed of 11 stimuli were repeated five times without any perturbance of the constant stimulus flow. We found significant delta entrainment by these patterns in the A1, medial geniculate body, and medial pulvinar. In A1 and pulvinar, we observed a statistically significant, pattern structure-aligned modulation of neuronal firing that occurred earliest in the pulvinar, supporting the idea that grouping and detecting complex auditory patterns is a top-down, context-driven process. Besides electrophysiological measures, a pattern-related modulation of pupil diameter verified that, like humans, nonhuman primates consciously detect complex repetitive patterns that lack physical boundaries.","auditory perception, oscillations, rhythms, macaque, auditory patterns",

We hypothesized that processing of visceral information in the VPL nucleus of the thalamus is similar to spinothalamic tract (STT) organization of visceral afferent input. Urinary bladder distention excites sacral and upper-lumbar STT cells that have somatic input from proximal somatic fields25; whereas, thoracic STT cells are inhibited by UBD7. Extracellular action potentials of 67 neurons were recorded in VPL nucleus. Urinary bladder distention excited 22 cells, inhibited 9 cells, and did not affect activity of 36 cells. Seventeen of 22 cells excited by UBD also received convergent somatic input from noxious squeeze of the hip, groin, or perineal regions. No cells activated only by innocuous somatic stimuli were excited by UBD. Five of 9 cells inhibited by UBD had upper-body somatic fields. There was a significant tendency for VPL neurons excited by UBD to have proximal lower-body somatic fields that were excited by noxious stimulation of skin and underlying muscle (P < 0.001). Antidromic activation of 4 thalamic neurons affected by UBD showed that visceral input stimulated by UBD reached the primary somatosensory (SI) cortex.",Visceral afferent; Somatic afferent; Nociception; Spinothalamic tract; Thalamocortical neuron;,

We report on the distribution of thalamic projections originating in the fusiform gyrus, as studied with the Nauta method for anterogradely degenerating axons, in a case of right fusiform gyrus infarction. Ipsilaterally to the lesion, high density of afferents was found in the inferior pulvinar nucleus and a low density in the medial pulvinar nucleus as well as in the postero-inferior part of the reticular nucleus; no degenerating fibres were found in the lateral geniculate body. Degenerating axons were completely absent in the contralateral thalamus. Thus, there is a precise topographic relationship between parts of the extrastriate cortex and the pulvinar, suggesting segregated thalamocortical pathways for different parts of the extrastriate cortex.

Injections of tritiated amino acids were placed within individual cytoarchitectonic areas of the frontal cortex in the rhesus monkey. It was demonstrated that the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex (areas 46, 9/46, and 9) and its medial extension (medial areas 9 and 9/32) is the origin of a specific fiber pathway, running posteriorly as part of the cingulum bundle, and terminating mainly in the retrosplenial area 30 and the posterior presubiculum. This fiber bundle therefore provides the anatomical substrate of a functional interaction between the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and the hippocampal memory system for the monitoring of information within working memory.

Despite the pervasive role of the midline thalamus in cognition and disease, there is a limited understanding of its function in humans, likely due to the absence of a rigorous noninvasive neuroimaging methodology to identify its location. Here, we introduce a new method for identifying the midline thalamus in vivo using probabilistic tractography and k-means clustering with diffusion weighted imaging data. This approach clusters thalamic voxels based on data-driven cortical and subcortical connectivity profiles and then segments the midline thalamus according to anatomical connectivity tracer studies in rodents and macaques. Results from two different diffusion weighted imaging sets, including adult data (22–35 years) from the Human Connectome Project (n = 127) and adolescent data (9–14 years) collected at Florida International University (n = 34) showed that this approach reliably classifies midline thalamic clusters. As expected, these clusters were most evident along the dorsal/ventral extent of the third ventricle and were primarily connected to the agranular medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), nucleus accumbens, and medial temporal lobe regions. The midline thalamus was then bisected based on a human brain atlas into a dorsal midline thalamic cluster (paraventricular and paratenial nuclei) and a ventral midline thalamic cluster (rhomboid and reuniens nuclei). This anatomical connectivity-based identification of the midline thalamus offers the opportunity for necessary investigation of this region in vivo in the human brain and how it relates to cognitive functions in humans, and to psychiatric and neurological disorders.",,

Almost all of the prefrontal cortical projections to the hypothalamus arise from areas within the “medial prefrontal network,” as defined previously by Carmichael and Price ([1996] J. Comp. Neurol. 371:179–207). Outside of the OMPFC, only a few neurons in the temporal pole, anterior cingulate and insular cortex project to the hypothalamus. Axons from the OMPFC also innervate the basal forebrain, zona incerta, and ventral midbrain. Within the medial prefrontal network, different regions project to distinct parts of the hypothalamus. The medial wall areas 25 and 32 send the heaviest projections to the hypothalamus; axons from these areas are especially concentrated in the anterior hypothalamic area and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Orbital areas 13a, 12o, and Iai, which are related to the medial prefrontal network, selectively innervate the lateral hypothalamic area, especially its posterior part. The cellular regions of the paraventricular, supraoptic, suprachiasmatic, arcuate, and mammillary nuclei are conspicuously devoid of cortical axons, but many axons abut the borders of these nuclei and may contact dendrites that extend from them. Areas within the orbital prefrontal network on the posterior orbital surface and agranular insula send only weak projections to the posterior lateral hypothalamic area. The rostral orbital surface does not contribute to the cortico-hypothalamic projection. J. Comp. Neurol. 401:480–505, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

These results, combined with recent results in object recognition memory from monkeys with mediodorsal thalamic lesions, show that the impairment produced by this lesion is more general, affecting a broader range of memory tasks, than the impairment which is produced in monkeys by lesions restricted to the hippocampus–fornix–mamillary system. It is also more severe than the effect of lesions limited to the medial part of the magnocellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. These findings extend the evidence that the magnocellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus has an important and general role in memory, and they are consistent with the proposal that lesions of the magnocellular division of that nucleus have their effect by disrupting the function of prefrontal cortex.",amnesia; prefrontal; macaque; episodic; Korsakoff;,

The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-médian/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi. This type of information should be taken into account when interpreting data from deep brain stimulation applied to pallidal and subthalamic regions in Parkinson's disease.",,

Less than 25% of the superficial hSI projecting cells were putatively contacted by terminals of cervical enlargement spinothalamic neurons. These cells were primarily located in ventro-posterior lateral, ventroposterior inferior and centrolateral nuclei. Although the number of superficial hSI projecting cells numbered less than 20% of the total hSI projecting cells, their patterns of location and their proportion of overlap with STT terminals within each thalamic nucleus were similar. It is suggested that the spinothalamic nociceptive information input to the cortex equally accesses both superficial and deep SI.",Spinothalamic terminal; Thalamocortical cell; Anterograde transport; Retrograde transport; Squirrel monkey; Macaque monkey; Nociception;,

Localization, cell surface expression, and activity-dependent regulation of glutamate receptors in both neurons and glia are performed and maintained by a complex network of protein–protein interactions associated with targeting, anchoring, and spatially organizing synaptic proteins at the cell membrane. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of transcripts encoding the AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1–GluR4) and a family of AMPA-related intracellular proteins. We focused on PDZ-proteins that are involved in the regulated pool and anchoring AMPA subunits to the cell membrane (PICK1, syntenin), and those maintaining the constitutive pool of AMPA receptors at the glutamatergic synapse (NSF, stargazin). In addition, we studied a fifth protein, KIAA1719, with high homology to the rat PDZ protein ABP, associated with the clustering of AMPA receptors at the glutamate synapse. The AMPA subunits showed significant differences in regional expression, especially in the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. The expression of other proteins, even those related to a specific AMPA subunit (such as ABP and PICK1 to GluR2 and GluR3), often had different distributions, whereas others (like NSF) are ubiquitously distributed in the brain. These results suggest that AMPA subunits and related intracellular proteins are differentially distributed in the macaque brain, and in numerous structures there are significant mismatches, suggesting additional functional properties of the associated intracellular proteins.

These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations. The differential laminar distributions of neurons projecting to the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus suggest that these structures may receive independent types of information from the prefrontal cortex.",,

Labeled neurons within the hippocampal formation (CA1, CA1′, prosubiculum, and subiculum) were found rostrally, although some were noted throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. Most labeled neurons in the hippocampal formation projected to medial prefrontal cortices, followed by orbital areas. In addition, there were differences in the topography of afferent neurons projecting to medial when compared with orbital cortices. Labeled neurons innervating medial cortices were found mainly in the CA1′ and CA1 fields rostrally, but originated in the subicular fields caudally. In contrast, labeled neurons which innervated orbital cortices were considerably more focal, emanating from the same relative position within a field throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation. In marked contrast to the pattern of projection to medial and orbital prefrontal cortices, lateral prefrontal areas received projections from only a few labeled neurons found mostly in the subicular fields. Lateral prefrontal cortices, lateral prefrontal cortices received the most robust projections from the presubiculum and the supracallosal area 29a-c. Orbital, and to a lesser extent medial, prefrontal areas received projections from a smaller but significant number of neurons from the presubiculum and area 29a-c. Only a few labeled neurons were found in the parasubiculum, and most projected to medial prefrontal areas. The results suggest that functionally distinct prefrontal cortices receive projections from different components of the hippocampal region. Medial and orbital prefrontal cortices may have a role in long-term mnemonic process similar to those associated with the hippocampal formation with which they are linked. Moreover, the preponderance of projection neurons from the hippocampal formation innervating medial when compared with orbital prefrontal areas followed the opposite trend from what we had observed previously for the amygdala (Barbas and De Olmos [1990]) (J Comp Neurol 301:1–23). Thus, the hippocampal formation, associated with mnemonic processes, targets predominantly medial prefrontal cortices, whereas the amygdala, associated with emotional aspects of memory, issues robust projections to orbital limbic cortices. Lateral prefrontal cortices receive robust projections from the presubiculum and area 29a-c and sparse projections from the hippocampal formation. These findings are consistent with the idea that the role of lateral prefrontal cortices in memory is distinct from that of either medial or orbital cortices. The results suggest that signals from functionally distinct limbic structures to some extent follow parallel pathways to functionally distinct prefrontal cortices. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Whether similar dynamics apply to the thalamus and in particular to the pulvinar is largely unknown. Here, we examined electrophysiological recordings from two adult rhesus macaques performing a perceptual task and comparatively investigated trial-to-trial variability in higher-order thalamus (ventral and dorsal pulvinar), the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex (area V4) prior to and following the presentation of a visual stimulus. We found spiking variability during stable fixation prior to stimulus onset to be considerably lower in both pulvinar and the LGN as compared to area V4. In contrast to the prominent variability reduction in V4 upon stimulus onset, variability in the thalamic nuclei was largely unaffected by visual stimulation. There was a small but significant variability decrease in the dorsal pulvinar, but not in the ventral portion of the pulvinar, which is closely connected to visual cortices and would thus have been expected to reflect cortical response properties. This dissociation did not stem from differences in response strength or mean firing rates and indicates fundamental differences in variability quenching between thalamus and cortex.",,

In the present study we have combined electron microscopy with immunocytochemistry for the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) to assess the cholinergic synaptic organization of the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus in macaque monkeys. The cholinergic innervation of the MD nucleus showed striking regional variations with the greatest density of immunoreactive axons and varicosities found within the parvicellular division. Electron microscopic examination revealed that these ChAT immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) axons were primarily small and unmyelinated. The majority of immunoreactive synaptic profiles were found within the extraglomerular neuropil (80.5%), with the remainder present in glomerular regions. Within the glomerular and extra-glomerular neuropil ChAT-IR profiles made contact with both conventional, presumably relay cell dendrites (CD), as well as with synaptic vesicle containing dendrites (SVCD) of local circuit neurons. In the glomeruli the frequency of synapses was approximately equal for CDs and SVCDs while in the extraglomerular areas 75% of the synaptic contacts were with CDs. ChAT-IR synaptic profiles had a diversity of junctional complex morphologies. Within glomeruli they made symmetric synapses with CDs and predominantly asymmetric with SVCDs. The majority of extraglomerular contacts (60%) were classified as asymmetric and these as well as the smaller number of symmetric synapses contacted both CDs and SVCDs. In accord with results of physiological studies, these anatomical data indicate that cholinergic input to thalamic nuclei influences relay cell activity both directly and indirectly via local circuit neurons. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Evidence is presented that the widely accepted proposal of Rose and Woolsey (1948) to name all cortex prefrontal that is reached by afferents from the mediodorsal nucleus is questionable for three reasons: the diversity of cortical fields reached by the mediodorsal nucleus, the overlapping of thalamic projections, and the possibility of a column- or band-like thalamocortical organization.

The combined methods of electrophysiologically guided cortical injections of tritiated leucine and stereotaxic injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the CL and PC nuclei were utilized. Additionally, fluorescent double-labeling techniques demonstrated patterns of intralaminar axon collateralization. We found that the ILN project ipsilaterally to all visual cortical areas except area 17. Projections to visual cortex are not arranged topographically or retinotopically. The ILN also project to the frontal eye fields (areas 6 and 8), anterior cingulate gyrus, suprasylvian fringe of the auditory cortex, insular cortex, parietal areas 5 and 7, caudate nucleus and claustrum. We noted especially heavy projections to the frontal eye fields and parietal areas 5 and 7. Fibers from the ILN terminate in cortical layers I and VI, and at the layer III–IV border. The demonstration of collateralization of ILN axons to two separate cortical areas implies that the same neuronal message may pass from the ILN to multiple cortical areas. It is concluded that the ILN may mediate a general cortical activation and may play a role in attention to visual, auditory and somatosensory (especially nociceptive) stimuli.",thalamic intralaminar nuclei; cortex; cat; horseradish peroxidase; autoradiography; fluorescent double-labeling technique;,

This issue was investigated for the marmoset monkey by recording from 55 single tactile-sensitive neurons in the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) with a projection to either SI or SII, identified with the use of the antidromic collision technique. Neurons activated from the hand and distal forearm were classified according to their peripheral source of input and characterized in terms of their functional capacities to determine whether the directthalamic input can account for tactile processing in both SIand SII. Both the SI- and SII-projecting samples contained aslowly adapting (SA) class of neurons, sensitive to static skin displacement, and purely dynamically sensitive tactile neurons that could be subdivided into two classes. One was most sensitive to high-frequency (≥100 Hz) cutaneous vibration whose input appeared to be derived from Pacinian sources, while the other was sensitive to lower frequency vibration (≤100 Hz) or trains of rectangular mechanical pulse stimuli, that appeared to receive its input fromrapidly adapting (RA) afferent fibers presumed to be associated with intradermal tactile receptors. There appeared to be no systematic differences in functional capacities between SI- and SII-projecting neurons of each of these three classes, based on receptive field characteristics, on the form of stimulus-response relations, and on measures derived from these relations. These measures included threshold and responsiveness values, bandwidths of vibrational sensitivity, and the capacity for responding to cutaneous vibrotactile stimuli with phase-locked, temporally patterned impulse activity. The analysis indicates that low-threshold, high-acuity tactile information is conveyed directly to both SI and SII from overlapping regions within the thalamic VP nucleus. This direct confirmation of a parallel functional projection to both SI and SII in the marmoset is consistent with our separate studies at the cortical level that demonstrate first, that tactile responsiveness in SII largely survives the SI inactivation and second,that SI responsiveness is largely independent of SII. It therefore reinforces the evidence that SI and SII occupy a hierarchically equivalent network for tactile processing.",,

Calretinin was found to be heterogeneously distributed in the primate thalamus and to occur only in specific neuronal populations of certain thalamic nuclei. Neuronal cells and fibers in midline nuclei and their dorsolateral extension, which includes the parataenial and central superior lateral nuclei, displayed the most intense calretinin immunoreactivity. The immunoreactivity for cells and fibers in the intralaminar nuclei was moderate rostrally but very weak caudally. The centre médian nucleus, together with the medial habenular nucleus, were virtually devoid of calretinin immunostaining. The mediodorsal nucleus displayed a markedly heterogeneous staining, with numerous clusters of labeled cells and fibers in its central parvicellular part. Cell and fiber immunoreactivity ranged from moderate to high in the nuclei of the anterior and lateral groups, but was very weak in the nuclei of the ventral and posterior groups. There was a small to moderate number of heterogeneously distributed calretinin-immunoreactive cells and fibers in the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, as well as in the reticular nucleus. The present study provides the first evidence for the existence of calretinin in primate thalamus, where this protein is distributed according to a highly heterogeneous pattern.

We studied the relative contributions of the tectofugal and geniculostriate systems to the visual properties of neurons in the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) by comparing the effects of unilateral removal of striate cortex, the superior colliculus, or of both structures. In the intact monkey, STP neurons have large, bilateral receptive fields. Complete unilateral removal of striate cortex did not eliminate visual responses of STP neurons in the contralateral visual hemifield; rather, nearly half the cells still responded to visual stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the lesion. Thus the visual properties of STP neurons are not completely dependent on the geniculostriate system. Unilateral striate lesions did affect the response properties of STP neurons in three ways. Whereas most STP neurons in the intact monkey respond similarly to stimuli in the two visual hemifields, responses to stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the striate lesion were usually weaker than responses in the ipsilateral hemifield. Whereas the responses of many STP neurons in the intact monkey were selective for the direction of stimulus motion or for stimulus form, responses in the hemifield contralateral to the striate lesion were not selective for either motion or form. Whereas the median receptive field in the intact monkey extended 80 degrees into the contralateral visual field, the receptive fields of cells with responses in the contralateral field that survived the striate lesions had a median border that extended only 50 degrees into the contralateral visual field. Removal of both striate cortex and the superior colliculus in the same hemisphere abolished the responses of STP neurons to visual stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to the combined lesion. Nearly 80% of the cells still responded to visual stimuli in the hemifield ipsilateral to the lesion. Unilateral removal of the superior colliculus alone had only small effects on visual responses in STP. Receptive-field size and visual response strength were slightly reduced in the hemifield contralateral to the collicular lesion. As in the intact monkey, selectivity for stimulus motion or form were similar in the two visual hemifields. We conclude that both striate cortex and the superior colliculus contribute to the visual responses of STP neurons. Striate cortex is crucial for the movement and stimulus specificity of neurons in STP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,

There is a continuing need to develop nondopaminergic approaches to treat Parkinsonism. One such approach is to use medications that normalize dopamine depletion-related firing abnormalities in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. In this study, we assessed the potential of a specific T-type calcium channel blocker (ML218) to eliminate pathologic burst patterns of firing in the basal ganglia-receiving territory of the motor thalamus in Parkinsonian monkeys. We also carried out an anatomical study, demonstrating that the immunoreactivity for T-type calcium channels is strongly expressed in the motor thalamus in normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys. At the electron microscopic level, dendrites accounted for >90% of all tissue elements that were immunoreactive for voltage-gated calcium channel, type 3.2-containing T-type calcium channels in normal and Parkinsonian monkeys. Subsequent in vivo electrophysiologic studies in awake MPTP-treated Parkinsonian monkeys demonstrated that intrathalamic microinjections of ML218 (0.5 μl of a 2.5-mM solution, injected at 0.1–0.2 μl/min) partially normalized the thalamic activity by reducing the proportion of rebound bursts and increasing the proportion of spikes in non-rebound bursts. The drug also attenuated oscillatory activity in the 3–13-Hz frequency range and increased gamma frequency oscillations. However, ML218 did not normalize Parkinsonism-related changes in firing rates and oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range. Whereas the described changes are promising, a more complete assessment of the cellular and behavioral effects of ML218 (or similar drugs) is needed for a full appraisal of their anti-Parkinsonian potential.","Parkinsonism, T-type calcium channel, nondopaminergic therapy, rebound burst",

In three monkeys, the large saccade part of the FEF (IFEF) was identified by microstimulation and injected with tracers. In a fourth monkey, the small saccade part of the FEF (sFEF) was identified by microstimulation and injected with tracer. Tracer injections were placed into the sFEF region of two other monkeys using anatomical landmarks. The IFEF and sFEF generally had distinct and largely segregated projections to posterior cortical areas, and the overall pattern of labeling in visual areas with established topology indicates that IFEF neurons preferentially project to areas having large and eccentric receptive fields, whereas sFEF neurons project to areas having smaller, more centrally located fields. The terminal fields from the sFEF were more widespread than those from IFEF. Projections from sFEF terminated in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), and the parietal part of visual area V3A, in the fundus of the superior temporal visual area (TST), the middle temporal area (MT), the medial superior temporal area (MST), the temporal part of visual area V4, the inferior temporal area (IT), and the temporal-occipital area (TEO) and in occipital visual areas V2, V3, and V4. Projections from IFEF terminated in parietal areas 7a, LIP, and VIP and the medial part of parietal area PE; in temporal areas MST and the superior temporal polysensory area (STP); and in occipital area V2 and posterior cingulate area 23b. Projections from IFEF and sFEF appeared to terminate in different parts of common target areas in MST, LIP, and V2. The topography of IFEF and sFEF projections to LIP suggests that this posterior eye field may also be organized by saccade amplitude. Most terminal labeling from FEF injections was bilaminar to layers I and V/VI, but labeling in area LIP, area MT, the medial part of area PE, and area 23b was columnar-form to all layers. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

In this report we show that such a projection exists, as demonstrated by the retrograde transport of the fluorescent labels fast blue (FB) and diamidino yellow (DY).

The retrograde tracer experiments demonstrate projections to the PAG that arise primarily from the medial prefrontal areas 25, 32, and 10m, anterior cingulate, and dorsomedial areas 24b and 9, select orbital areas 14c, 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l, and ventrolateral area 6v. Only scattered cells were retrogradely labeled in other areas in the PFC. Caudal to the PFC, projections to the PAG also arise from the posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal dysgranular, and granular parts of the temporal polar cortex, the ventral insula, and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Cells were also labeled in subcortical structures, including the central nucleus and ventrolateral part of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal PAG columns. The projections from medial prefrontal areas 10m, 25, and 32 end predominantly in the dorsolateral columns, bilaterally. Fibers from orbital areas 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l terminate primarily in the ventrolateral column, whereas fibers from dorsomedial areas 9 and 24b terminate mainly in the lateral column. The PFC areas that project to the PAG include most of the areas previously defined as the “medial prefrontal network.” The areas that comprise this network represent a visceromotor system, distinct from the sensory related “orbital network.” J.

We therefore applied parametric positron emission tomography (PET) analyses that allow characterization of rCBF responses as linear and nonlinear functions of the experimentally modulated stimulus (variable stimulator setting). In patients with electrodes in the thalamic ventrointermediate nucleus (VIM) for the treatment of essential tremor (ET) here we show that variations in voltage and frequency of thalamic stimulation have differential effects in a thalamo-cortical circuitry. Increasing stimulation amplitude was associated with a linear raise in rCBF at the thalamic stimulation site, but with a nonlinear rCBF response in the primary sensorimotor cortex (M1/S1). The reverse pattern in rCBF changes was observed with increasing stimulation frequency. These results indicate close connectivity between the stimulated nucleus (VIM) and primary sensorimotor cortex. Likewise, stimulation parameter-specific modulation occurs at this simple interface between an electrical and a cerebral system and suggests that the scope of DBS extends beyond an ablation-like on-off effect: DBS could rather allow a gradual tuning of activity within a neuronal circuit.",,

To address this issue, the patterns of thalamic and cortical inputs to the rostral (CMAr), dorsal (CMAd), and ventral (CMAv) cingulate motor areas were investigated in the macaque monkey. Tracer injections were made into identified forelimb representations of these areas, and the distributions of retrogradely labeled neurons were analyzed in the thalamus and the frontal cortex. The cells of origin of thalamocortical projections to the CMAr were located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus and the oral division of the ventrolateral nucleus (VLo). On the other hand, the thalamocortical neurons to the CMAd/CMAv were distributed predominantly in the VLo and the oral division of the ventroposterolateral nucleus-the caudal division of the ventrolateral nucleus. Additionally, many neurons in the intralaminar nuclear group were seen to project to the cingulate motor areas. Except for their well-developed interconnections, the corticocortical projections to the CMAr and CMAd/CMAv were also distinctively preferential. Major inputs to the CMAr arose from the presupplementary motor area and the dorsal premotor cortex, whereas inputs to the CMAd/CMAv originated not only from these areas but also from the supplementary motor area and the primary motor cortex. The present results indicate that the CMAr and the caudal cingulate motor area (involving both the CMAd and the CMAv) are characterized by distinct patterns of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, reflecting their functional differences.

This chapter discusses the synaptic relationships of these two systems in which the types of synaptic contacts formed is quantified by the two afferent systems, the nature of these relationships, coupled with post-embedding immunocytochemistry for the demonstration of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAir), and three dimensional, computer-assisted reconstructions of these synaptic relationships. The chapter explains that the thalamic circuitry serving non-noxious and noxious information, respectively, is fundamentally different from other thalamic nuclei as there is convergence of the two systems upon single thalamic neurons and the thalamic circuitry by which the primate thalamus processes information transmitted by spinal afferents is different from that processing information from the dorsal column nuclei. This differing circuitry can explain the basis for the transmission of convergent signals by thalamic neurons.",,

It is highly developed in human and nonhuman primates, but its origin, mode, and dynamics of development, resolution, and eventual extinction are not well understood because human postmortem tissue offers only static descriptive data, and mice cannot serve as an adequate experimental model for the distinct regional differences in primates. Here, we take advantage of the large and slowly developing SP in macaque monkey to examine the origin, settling pattern, and subsequent dispersion of the SP neurons in primates. Monkey embryos exposed to the radioactive DNA replication marker tritiated thymidine ([3H]dT, or TdR) at early embryonic ages were killed at different intervals postinjection to follow postmitotic cells' positional changes. As expected in primates, most SP neurons generated in the ventricular zone initially migrate radially, together with prospective layer 6 neurons. Surprisingly, mostly during midgestation, SP cells become secondarily displaced and widespread into the expanding SP zone, which becomes particularly wide subjacent to the association cortical areas and underneath the summit of its folia. We found that invasion of monoamine, basal forebrain, thalamocortical, and corticocortical axons is mainly responsible for this region-dependent passive dispersion of the SP cells. Histologic and immunohistochemical comparison with the human SP at corresponding fetal ages indicates that the same developmental events occur in both primate species.","cerebral cortex, brain evolution, transient lamination, neuronal migration, neural stem cells",

Strictly segregated and partly overlapping projections,"There is a widely held view that the cerebellum and basal ganglia act via separate subcortical channels. In rodent, however, electrophysiological evidence suggests that the output of these two systems is partly sent to a common set of thalamic neurons. In this study, the pattern of thalamic innervations provided by the deep cerebellar nuclei, the entopeduncular nucleus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata was reinvestigated in the rat using the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and wheat germ agglutinin. Although the results confirm the existence of some overlap in the cerebellar and basal ganglia projection fields, they also show that in such convergent areas the cerebellar innervation is modest and consists of sparsely distributed fibers of thin diameter that provide a few scattered terminal boutons. These observations are consistent with the view that, in rodent as in higher mammalian species, the cerebellum and the basal ganglia act mainly via distinct thalamo-cortical channels.",Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus;,

Most of these studies were performed with nocturnal animals, particularly mice and rats. In the current study, the PK2 and its receptor, PKR2, was cloned from a species of diurnal macaque monkey. The macaque monkey PK2 and PKR2 were found to be highly homologous to that of other mammalian species. The mRNA expression of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain was examined by in situ hybridization. The expression patterns of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain were found to be quite similar to that of the mouse brain. Particularly, PK2 mRNA was shown to oscillate in the SCN of the macaque brain in the same phase and with similar amplitude with that of nocturnal mouse brain. PKR2 expression was also detected in known primary SCN targets, including the midline thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. However, the PKR2 expression was only detected in the dorsal SCN of the macaque brain, in contrast to the broad expression of PKR2 in the dorsal and ventral segments of the mouse SCN. The likely functional importance of this differential expression of PKR2 in the SCN segments in the diurnal monkey vs nocturnal mouse remains to be explored. In addition, we detected the expression of PKR2 mRNA in the dorsal raphe nucleus of both macaque and mouse brains. As a likely SCN to dorsal raphe projection has previously been indicated, the expression of PKR2 in the raphe nuclei of both macaque and mouse brain signifies a possible role of dorsal raphe nucleus as a previously unrecognized primary SCN projection target.",,

The relevance of the cingulate to the structure and dynamics of large-scale networks ultimately requires a link to functional connectivity. Here, we map fine-grained functional connectivity across the complete extent of the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) cingulate cortex and delineate subdivisions pertaining to distinct identifiable networks. In particular, we identified 4 primary networks representing the functional spectrum of the cingulate: somatomotor, attention-orienting, executive, and limbic. The cingulate nodes of these networks originated from separable subfields along the rostral-to-caudal axis and were characterized by positive and negative correlations of spontaneous blood oxygen level–dependent activity. These findings represent a critical component for understanding how the anterior and midcingulate cortices integrate and shape information processing during task performance.

Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.",,

Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered ∼500 μm deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.",,

We injected tracers (Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, Horseradish Peroxidase, and Rhodamine Dextran), alone or in combination, into closely related cutaneous responsive sites, e. g., adjacent digits. Separated patches of labeling were found across the parietal operculum and insula for all injected locations. On the basis of cytoarchitectural criteria, the labeled regions include the second somatosensory area (SH), retroinsular area (Ri) and granular insula (Ig). Assuming the connections are homotopical from physiologically identified body representations in primary somatosensory cortex, the labeling patterns in SII include complete anterior and posterior body maps. The orientation of the body is erect in the posterior and supine in the anterior SII region. Area 3b has greater density of connections with anterior SIL The maps are mirror images aligned along the distal extremities. The anterior-posterior (A-P) length of the “SII region” exceeds 7 mm; it extends in the coronal plane from the fundus of the lateral sulcus to surface cortex near the anterior tip of the intraparietal sulcus. Two additional topographically organized maps are likely in Ri. These are “worm-like” body maps oriented along the A-P axis and joined at the head representation. Connections with the center of Ig are not somatotopically organized. The diversity of somatosensory areas in lateral parietal cortex revealed by the labeled connections was discussed in reference to prior mapping of SII in monkeys and was compared to reports of multiple areas in this region of cortex in other species.",,
