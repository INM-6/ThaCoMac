thalamus,The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis LR with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory LRM An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus comprising twelve levels is presented with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus Each level is described and compared

organization of projections of the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient nuclei of the pretectal complex and layers of the superior colliculus to the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar in the macaque monkey,The organization of five projections from the retinorecipient and non-retinorecipient layers of the superior colliculus SC and nuclei of the pre-tectum to the lateral pulvinar medial pulvinar and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus DLG of the thalamus in the macaque monkey were established by using both anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde horseradish perox-idase tracing techniques Some projections from these midbrain regions to the inferior pulvinar are also described as are projections to the thalamus from the tectorccipient parabigeminal nucleus First the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient pretectal nuclei and SC layers were determined by Nissl stains myelin stains and the distribution of label resulting from intraocular injections of tritiated amino acids The possible projections of these pre-tectal nuclei layers of the SC as well as the parabigeminal nucleus to the pulvinar and DLG were then determined by both horseradish peroxidase and autoradiographic tracing methods The retinal projections to the SC extend throughout layers II-l II- II- and dorsal III with obvious patches in layers II-l and II- as described before by others There were a number of pretectal nuclei which also had connections with the retina In the nomenclature adopted these include the sublentiform nucleus the nucleus of the optic tract not to be confused with the thalamic limitansnucleus the posterior orprincipal pretectalnucleus and the laminatedolivary nucleus with a head and tail The nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of the pretectal area do not receive retinal projections The retinorecipient midbrain regions which project to the pulvinar are as follows Aside from a complicated multifocal projection to the inferior pulvinar the superficial retinorecipient SC layers project to three terminal foci or zones in one or more of the lateral pulvinar subdivisions alpha beta and gamma Rezak and Benevento  Focus  lies mainly along the dorso-ventral lateral border of subdivisions of PL-gamma and PL-beta extending ventrally to PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- and III Focus  occu-pies the lateral  of PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- II- and III There is a topographical arrangement to the SC projections to foci  and  which may reflect a representation of more than two visual quadrants in the lateral pulvinar Focus  which consists of several clusters is located medially in PL-gamma and PL-beta and overlaps their mutual border with the medial pul-vinar Focus  is complicated as it is made up of a mixed input from the retinorecipient superficial and nonretinorecipient deep SC layers The portion of focus  located along the medial edge of the lateral pulvinar arises mainly from SC layers II- II- and III while the portion of the focus located along the adjacent lateral edge of the medial pulvinar arises mainly from SC layersIV V and VI These projections to the pulvinar from the superficial SC differ in their origins from those to the DLG which arise mainly from smaller cells in SC sublayer II- The nonretinorecipient SC projections to the pulvinar arise mainly from the deep layers ie IV V and VI and end in focus  within the medial pulvinar and the caudal oral pulvinar The projection from the deep SC layer to the medial half of focus  in the medial pulvinar has already been described above A pretectal projection to the lateral pulvinar from the retinorecipient region consisting of the nucleus of the optic tract the sublentiform nucleus and the posterior pretectal nucleus collectively called SL in our previous study Benevento et al b was confirmed This projection forms a focus focus  in the dorsal shoulder of the rostral lateral pulvinar which extends over foci  and  Our HRP data indicate that these pretectal nuclei might have convergent projections with the SC to foci  to  and the DLG How- ever because of the problem of interruption of fibers of passage this inter- pretation of convergent projections should be viewed with caution The HRP studies also indicate that the parabigeminal nucleus which is inter- connected with the SC projects to the thalamus as it contained a modest number of labelled cells after injections of the inferior pulvinar and focus  in PL-alpha but only a sparse number after injections of the DLG and focus  These results suggest that direct retinal influences can be relayed to visually responsive association cortex via retino-tectal-lateral pulvinar retino-pretectal-lateral pulvinar and retino-tecto-parabigeminal-lateral pulvinar routes in addition to the retino-tectal-geniculate and retino-tectal-inferior pulvinar routes In addition visuomotor and polysensory information influences thalamocortical systems via projections from the deep layers of the SC to the medial pulvinar When these findings are compared with the known organization of pulvinocortical interconnections one can conclude that the cortex of all four neocortical lobes can be influenced rather directly by the midbrain The response properties of the various cortical visual areas thus need not depend solely upon the corticocortical projections,

afferent connections of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the rat, related to the mediodorsal-prefrontal topography",The aim of the present study was to determine the organization of the afferents of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in relation to the reciprocal connections of this nucleus with different areas of the prefrontal cortex For this purpose injections of horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin were placed in different parts of the mediodorsal nucleus These experiments revealed the organization of the reciprocal mediodorsal-prefrontal connections since wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase is transported effectively in anterograde and retrograde directions Injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tracers were placed in different portions of the prefrontal cortex and the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was injected in the mediodorsal nucleus in order to verify in more detail the point-to-point relationship in the mediodorsal-prefrontal connections The organization of a number of the subcortical afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus was determined in detail using injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or tritiated amino acids in areas identified as a source of mediodorsal afferents in the retrograde tracing experiments These anterograde tracers were injected in different parts of the pallidal complex the amygdala the lateral hypothalamus the lateral entorhinal cortex the ventral mesencephalon the superior colliculus and the dorsal tegmental region The results of the present experiments indicate that the mediodorsal nucleus on the basis of its cyto-myelo- and chemoarchitecture as well as the organization of its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex can be subdivided into a medial a central a lateral and a paralamellar segment Apart from this subdivision along a mediolateral axis rostrocaudal and dorsoventral differences are also evident in the structural organization and connectivity of the mediodorsal nucleus A number of subcortical structures send fibres to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus The reticular thalamic nucleus projects to the mediodorsal nucleus in a topographical way such that its rostral part is connected with the rostral part of the nucleus whereas more caudal and ventral areas in the reticular thalamic nucleus are connected with more caudal parts of the mediodorsal nucleus Regions in the brainstem that project to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus include the mesencephalic raphénuclei the locus coeruleus the rostral part of the central gray substance and the reticular formation The median raphénucleus projects most heavily to lateral parts of the mediodorsal nucleus whereas the dorsal raphénucleus is most strongly connected with its medial parts Besides these general inputs the different mediodorsal nuclear segments receive a specific input and have different relations with particular areas of the prefrontal cortex The rostral part of the medial segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the prelimbic and the ventral anterior cingulate areas and to a lesser degree with the medial orbital and the ventral agranular insular areas The posterior ventral part of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus has reciprocal fibre relations with the dorsal agranular insular area The most medial part of the nucleus immediately adjacent to the paraventricular nucleus receives fibres from the infralimbic area but appears not to reciprocate them The medial segment receives input from a large number of structures in the realm of the limbic system ie the amygdala the lateral entorhinal cortex the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area the supramammillary nuclei and from structures that are closely related to the basal ganglia system ie the ventral pallidum the ventral tegmental area and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra With an antibody against dopamine it was determined that both the paraventricular nucleus and the adjacent parts of the mediodorsal nucleus contain a plexus of dopaminergic fibres The most medial zone of the dorsal-medial thalamus which includes the paraventricular nucleus receives additional fibres from the nucleus accumbens the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis the dorsomedial hypothalamus the subiculum the parabrachial nuclei and the nucleus of the solitary tract The central segment of the mediodorsal nucleus differs from the medial segment in that it receives its most strong and specific input from olfactory related structures such as the deep layers of the prepiriform cortex and the ventral pallidal cells in the olfactory tubercle The central segment also receives afferents from the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area and the lateral hypothalamus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the ventral agranular insular and the lateral orbital areas The lateral segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives a small number of fibres from the medial portion of the globus pallidus and the lateral hypothalamus but its main inputs come from brainstem structures such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the dorsal anterior cingulate area The paralamellar segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives afferents from the deep layers of the superior colliculus the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus Additional inputs most probably come from pretectal nuclei the region of the cuneiform nucleus and the contralateral fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the medial precentral area of the frontal cortex an area that in the rat constitutes the frontal eye field These results indicate that in the rat via distinct segments of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus different parts of the prefrontal cortex can be influenced by a wide spectrum of structures that are mainly involved in the limbic circuitry or are part of the limbic-afferented basal ganglia An important observation is that the mediodorsal nucleus receives strong inputs from pallidal nigral and tectal areas which are the main waystations in the outflow of the basal ganglia This may imply a role for the mediodorsal nucleus in

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study, wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain, especially the temporal lobe and thalamus, were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp, ictal and cortical electroencephalography, MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients, Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition, hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however, corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years, rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models, a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models, cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover, some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models, a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore, we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys, the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter, a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models, the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore, the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months, such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently, brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore, the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.",Animal model; Brain imaging; Plasticity; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; nan

We have developed pain models for cynomolgus macaques because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the cynomolgus macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaques are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. The purpose of this study is to elucidate pain-related brain activation regions in the macaque models using fMRI. Generally, pain testing in animal models has been based on avoidance behavior against pain stimuli. However, we identified pain-related brain activation regions using fMRI under propofol anesthesia as a more objective evaluation method. In the macaque model of chymopapain-induced discogenic low back pain, the activity of the insular cortex occurred in response to lumbar compression stimulation. In the macaque model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, activation of the insular cortex also occurred in response to cold stimuli. As a result of evaluating pregabalin, duloxetine and tramadol, only duloxetine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the macaque model of postoperative pain, activation of the insula cortex was mainly activated by pressure stimulation. As a result of evaluating morphine, pregabalin and diclofenac, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to postoperative pain. However, macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis exhibited a pain response against pressure stimuli to the abdomen, and had activation of the thalamus. As a result of evaluating morphine, meloxicam and acetaminophen, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of thalamus due to abdominal pain from endometriosis. It was suggested that the brain activation regions could change due to various conditions that can cause the pain, as the acute pain increased activation in the insula cortex and the chronic pain increased activation in the thalamus. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fMRI as a pain biomarker, and fMRI analysis using the macaques might provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. Therefore, these study will contribute to the development of new analgesics for each pain as well as to the progress in the areas of brain research.",Thalamus; Insula cortex; Nonhuman primate; Brain activation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; LOW-BACK-PAIN

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

In this work, we acquired five PET scans using a highly selective D2/D3 dopamine antagonist, 18F-fallypride, to track changes in dopamine receptor availability, as measured by the distribution volume ratio (DVR), through the course of DBS in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in a nonhuman primate. Methods: PET scans were performed on a rhesus monkey with unilateral BNST stimulation during periods of baseline, chronic high frequency (130 Hz) and low frequency (50 Hz) DBS stimulation, and during a washout period between stimulation periods. A final scan was performed with the electrode stimulation starting 110 min into the scan. Whole brain parametric images of 18F-fallypride DVR were calculated for each condition to track changes in both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 availability. Results: The monkey displayed significant increases in receptor binding throughout the brain during DBS relative to baseline for 130 and 50 Hz, with changes in DVR of: caudate 42%, 51%; putamen 56%, 57%; thalamus 33%,49%; substantia nigra 29%,26%; and prefrontal cortex 28%, 56%, respectively. Washout and post-stimulation scans revealed DVR values close to baseline values. Activating the stimulator midway through the final scan resulted in no statistically significant changes in binding. Conclusions: PET neuroligand imaging has demonstrated the sensitivity to track changes in dopamine D2/D3 binding during the course of DBS. These methods show great potential for providing insight into the neurochemical consequences of DBS. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1630,10.3791/5133,,,,,,,"Large-scale Reconstructions and Independent, Unbiased Clustering Based on Morphological Metrics to Classify Neurons in Selective Populations","This protocol outlines large-scale reconstructions of neurons combined with the use of independent and unbiased clustering analyses to create a comprehensive survey of the morphological characteristics observed among a selective neuronal population. Combination of these techniques constitutes a novel approach for the collection and analysis of neuroanatomical data. Together, these techniques enable large-scale, and therefore more comprehensive, sampling of selective neuronal populations and establish unbiased quantitative methods for describing morphologically unique neuronal classes within a population. The protocol outlines the use of modified rabies virus to selectively label neurons. G-deleted rabies virus acts like a retrograde tracer following stereotaxic injection into a target brain structure of interest and serves as a vehicle for the delivery and expression of EGFP in neurons. Large numbers of neurons are infected using this technique and express GFP throughout their dendrites, producing Golgi-like complete fills of individual neurons. Accordingly, the virus-mediated retrograde tracing method improves upon traditional dye-based retrograde tracing techniques by producing complete intracellular fills. Individual well-isolated neurons spanning all regions of the brain area under study are selected for reconstruction in order to obtain a representative sample of neurons. The protocol outlines procedures to reconstruct cell bodies and complete dendritic arborization patterns of labeled neurons spanning multiple tissue sections. Morphological data, including positions of each neuron within the brain structure, are extracted for further analysis. Standard programming functions were utilized to perform independent cluster analyses and cluster evaluations based on morphological metrics. To verify the utility of these analyses, statistical evaluation of a cluster analysis performed on 160 neurons reconstructed in the thalamic reticular nucleus of the thalamus (TRN) of the macaque monkey was made. Both the original cluster analysis and the statistical evaluations performed here indicate that TRN neurons are separated into three subpopulations, each with unique morphological characteristics.",Neuroscience; Issue 120; neuroanatomy; retrograde tracer; modified rabies virus; neuronal reconstruction; independent clustering algorithms; cluster evaluation; nan

In this review we explore more recent experiments that extend the role of the substantia nigra pars reticulata from a simple gate for eye movements to include a role in cognitive processes for eye movements. We review recent evidence suggesting that basal ganglia nuclei beyond the substantia nigra may also play a role in eye movements and the cognitive events leading up to the production of eye movements. We close by pointing out some unresolved questions in our understanding of the relationship of basal ganglia nuclei and eye movements.

Circuit-specific behaviors (those that appear to be mediated exclusively by circuit structures) and circuit-related behaviors (those that involve both circuit and noncircuit structures) are discussed. Drugs that alter behavior through effects on the circuits are presented. The three circuits that are most relevant to understanding behavior are emphasized.",nan; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATOPALLIDAL SYSTEM; PARALLEL ORGANIZATION; THALAMIC INFARCTION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SECONDARY MANIA

Methods: Carbon-11-CFT (WIN 35,428, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropan), C-11-CCT (RTI-131, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-monochlorophenyl)tropane), and C-11-CDCT (dichloropane, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane) were evaluated as imaging probes for dopamine neurons in five normal and in two MPTP-treated cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) using a high-resolution PET imaging system (PCR-I). Results: For C-11-CFT, the specific binding ratio (as defined by the ratio of radioactivity levels in striatum versus cerebellum) was 4.2 +/- 0.8 in caudate and 4.9 +/- 1.2 in putamen at 60 min and 4.9 +/- 1.2 and 5.5 +/- 1.1 at 90 min in control animals. In MPTP-treated monkeys the corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.5 +/- 0.1 in putamen at 60 min and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.4 +/- 0.3 in putamen at 90 min. For the monochloro analog of CFT, C-11-CCT, the ratios in control caudate and putamen were 2.7 +/- 0.4 and 3.4 +/- 0.3, respectively, at 60 min and 3.7 +/- 0.5 and 4.4 +/- 0.6, respectively, at 90 min. In MPTP-treated animals, corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.5 +/- 0.3 at 60 min and 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.4 at 90 min. The dichloro analog of CFT, CDCT, which has the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter, generated the lowest ratios in control brains, 2.3 +/- 0.4 in caudate and 2.4 +/- 0.5 in putamen at 60 min. In one MPTP-treated monkey, the corresponding ratios were 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.3. In comparison with C-11-CFT, both C-11-CCT and C-11-CDCT were less selective and had high uptake in the thalamus. Conclusion: The present results clearly indicate that C-11-CFT is a useful ligand for monitoring dopamine neuronal degeneration.","CFT (WIN 35,428); CCT (RTI-131); CDCT (dichloropane); positron emission tomography; Parkinson's disease; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION SITES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BRAIN DOPAMINE; PRIMATE MODEL; I-125 RTI-55; RAT-BRAIN; BINDING; INVIVO; AUTORADIOGRAPHY"

1993,10.1016/s0079-6123(03)14400-3,,,,,,,Identifying corollary discharges for movement in the primate brain,"The brain keeps track of the movements it makes so as to process sensory input accurately and coordinate complex movements gracefully. In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain, although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge, for example on visual processing, has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second, they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge, such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals, particularly in the realm of sensory perception, remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys, and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge signals.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ORIENTING GAZE SHIFTS; HEAD-FREE CAT; RHESUS-MONKEY; TECTORETICULOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; CENTRAL THALAMUS
