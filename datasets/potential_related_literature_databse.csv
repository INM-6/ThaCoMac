We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neuron's receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a “response vector” whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19–26%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 ± 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response.",,

Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay, and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain, detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information. To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control. Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation. The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia.",Dopamine; Thalamus; Monkey; Human; Primate; Dopamine transporter; Parkinson; Schizophrenia; Addiction;,

ML and STT axons were labeled by the anterograde axon transport of WGA-HRP following injection of the tracer into the contralateral dorsal column nuclei, or the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, respectively. Thalamic tissue was histochemically reacted for the presence of HRP. Serial thin sections were stained with a gold-labeled antibody to GABA, to determine which neuronal elements exhibited GABA immunoreactivity (GABA- ir). Serially sectioned thalamic structures were recorded in electron micrographs and reconstructed in three dimensions by computer. Individual ML axon terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with segments of the proximal dendritic trees of thalamocortical relay neurons and also synapse upon the dendritic appendages of GABA-ir interneurons (local circuit neurons). These GABA-ir dendritic appendages contain synaptic vesicles and are presynaptic (presynaptic dendrites) to the same segments of relay neuron dendrites that receive ML contacts. When analyzed in serial sections and reconstructed by computer, the ML terminals form triadic relationships (ML, GABA appendage, and relay neuron dendrite) or more complex glomerular arrangements involving multiple appendages, all of which then contact the relay neuron dendritic segment. In contrast, multiple STT terminals make synaptic contacts along segments of projection neuron dendrites and are usually the only type of profile to contact that segment of dendrite. More than 85% of the spinal afferents form simple axodendritic synapses with relay cells and do not contact GABA-ir appendages. The thalamic synaptic relationships of ML terminals are fundamentally different from those formed by the STT. Because STT neurons predominatly transmit information about noxious stimuli, the simple axodendritic circuitry of the majority of these spinal afferents suggests that the transmission of noxious information is probably not subject to GABAergic modulation by thalamic interneurons, in contrast to the GABAergic processing of non-noxious information carried by the ML afferents. The differences in the GABAergic circuits of the thalamus that mediate ML and STT afferent information are believed to underlie differential somatosensory processing in the forebrain. We suggest that changes in thalamic GABAergic dendritic appendages and GABA receptors following CNS injury may play a role in the genesis of some central pain states.",,

Our goal was to determine the proportion of labeled neurons contributing to this projection system by the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei, and to investigate the relationship of thalamic projections to specific architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex. We selected areas for study within both the basoventral (areas 11, 12, and ventral 46) and the mediodorsal (areas 32, 14, 46, and 8) prefrontal sectors. This choice was based on our previous studies, which indicate differences in cortical projections to these two distinct architectonic sectors (Barbas, '88; Barbas and Pandya, '89). In addition, for each sector we included areas with different architectonic profiles, which is also relevant to the connectional patterns of the prefrontal cortices. The results showed that MD included a clear majority (over 80%) of all thalamic neurons directed to some prefrontal cortices (areas 11, 46, and 8); it contributed just over half to some others (areas 12 and 32), and less than a third to area 14. Clusters of neurons directed to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal areas were largely segregated within MD: the former were found ventrally, the latter dorsally. However, the most striking findings establish a relationship between thalamic origin and laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. Most thalamic neurons directed to lateral prefrontal cortices, which are characterized by a high degree of laminar definition (areas 46 and 8), originated in the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions of MD, and only a few were found in other nuclei. In contrast, orbital and medial cortices, which have a low degree of laminar differentiation, were targeted by the magnocellular subdivision of MD and by numerous other limbic thalamic nuclei, including the midline and the anterior. Thus topographic specificity in the origin of thalamic projections increased as the laminar definition of the target area increased. Moreover, the rostrocaudal distribution of labeled neurons in MD and the medial pulvinar also differed depending on the degree of the laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. The rostral parts of MD and the medial pulvinar projected to the eulaminate lateral prefrontal cortices, whereas their caudal parts projected to orbital and medial limbic cortices. Selective destruction of caudal MD is known to disrupt mnemonic processes in both humans and monkeys, suggesting that this thalamic-limbic prefrontal loop may constitute an important pathway for memory.",,

To this purpose, restricted injections of neuronal tracers were made into areas F3, F6, F2, and F7 after physiological identification of the injection sites. The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. The main inputs to F3 [supplementary motor area properly defined (SMA-proper)] originate in the nuclei ventral lateral, pars oralis (VLo), ventral posterior lateral, pars oralis (VPLo), and ventral lateral, pars caudalis (VLc) as well as in caudal parts of the VPLo and VLc (VPLo/VLc complex). F6 (pre-SMA) is mainly the target of nucleus ventral anterior, pars parvocellularis (VApc), and area X of Olszewski. The input to F2 originates mainly in the VPLo/VLc complex, in VLc, and in VLo. The dorsal part of F7 (supplementary eye field) mainly receives from area X, VApc, and nucleus ventral anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc), whereas the ventral F7 is connected with VApc, area X, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). It is concluded that each cortical area is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits. F3 and F2 are targets of the so-called “motor” basal ganglia circuit and a cerebellar circuit originating in dorsorostral sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. In contrast, F6 and ventral F7 receive a basal ganglia input mainly from the so-called “complex” circuit and a cerebellar input originating in the ventrocaudal sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. Finally, with respect to the rest of F7, dorsal F7 also receives a basal ganglia input from the “oculomotor circuit.” © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the ‘Anglo-American’ (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the ‘thalamic nucleus’; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral (‘relay’) and dorsal (‘associative’) ‘nuclei’. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic ‘region’ is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A ‘territory’ is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a ‘subregion’. For each of the studied ‘motor’ territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a ‘source space’. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A ‘thalamic nucleus’ is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The (‘dorsal’) thalamus is divided into ‘allo-’ and ‘isothalamus’, the latter with ‘bushy’ and ‘microneurons’. The lateral region is isothalamic. The ‘motor thalamus’ makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the ‘motor thalamus’ by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and ‘reslicing’. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated ‘cytoarchitectonic nuclei’. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' ‘V.im.e’, subject to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-médian-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedius-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars: nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM) cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",Primate; Motor system; Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus;,

These results identify a thalamic pathway for gravity cues to influence perception, action and spatial cognition.",,

Contrary to the prevailing belief that thalamocortical projections are entirely uncrossed, our findings indicate that a modest crossed projection to prefrontal cortex arises from the mesial thalamus, principally the anteromedial and midline nuclei. Also, while confirming that corticothalamic projections are bilateral, we found that the pattern of crossed projections differs from that of uncrossed projections. Projections to mesial thalamic nuclei, specifically to the anteromedial nucleus, the midline nuclei, and the magnocellular part of the mediodorsal nucleus are bilateral, the contralateral projection being nearly as dense as the ipsilateral projection. Projections to the parvicellular part of the mediodorsal and ventral anterior nuclei are also bilateral, but the contralateral projection is much weaker than the ipsilateral projection. Prefrontal projections to the reticular nucleus, medial pulvinar, suprageniculate nucleus, and limitans nucleus appear to be exclusively ipsilateral. These results indicate that prefrontal cortex has prominent bilateral and reciprocal connections with the nuclei of the mesial thalamic region. As this region of the diencephalon has been implicated by anatomical and behavioral studies in memory functions, our findings suggest that prefrontal cortex, through its connections with this region, may be involved in the bilateral integration of mnemonic systems.",,

Cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents,"The cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents of cingulate cortex were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatto). Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II–IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a–c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei. This latter nucleus projected more to area 23b than to areas 30 or 23a. Anterior medial nucleus efferents to cingulate cortex were of particular note for two reasons. First, AM projected primarily to posterior cingulate areas with area 23 receiving its principal thalamic input from AM. Second, projections to areas 30, 23a, and 23b were topographically organized with ventral areas 30 and 23a receiving from the central core of AM. While the more dorsally located area 23b received input from peripheral and medial. In light of the extensive projections of Cds, Csl, and Pf to anterior cingulate cortex, it is proposed that the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclie be classified as part of limbic thalamus along with the anterior, LD, and MD nuclei. Furthermore, although AM projects mainly to posterior cingulate cortex, it also has light projections to area 25 and minor input to area 24. As suhc, AM is the only limbic thalamic nucleus that has such widespread projections to cingulate cortex. Finally, visually evoked activity in area 23 may be the result of projections from the LP and medial pulvinar.",,

Here we examine neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus, with focus on the mediodorsal (MD) and the anterior nuclei (ANT), to determine if neurogenesis of rostral and caudal thalamic nuclei is concurrent or instead temporally staggered. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N=10) of [3H]dT labeled specimens, with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Slides were scanned to create digital images for subsequent analysis using Stereo Investigator software. Labeled neurons were mapped within a contour that encompassed the entire rostral thalamus. These maps were superimposed onto closely corresponding sections from the online BrainMaps macaque atlas to facilitate analysis. Our novel approach uncovered a previously undetected spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus. At E30, labeled neurons were located in a compact medial band; at E38-E40, labeling was dense ventrolaterally, and at E43, labeling predominated laterally at rostral levels and was widely distributed at caudal levels. Peak neurogenesis occurs earlier in MD (E30-E43) and ANT (E31-E43) than in LGN (E36-E43) and PUL (E36-E45). Birth-dating of neurons in MD and ANT, two higher order relay nuclei implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, provides further insight into the critical period of vulnerability during which early developmental perturbation may increase incidence of schizophrenia later in life.","mediodorsal nucleus, anterior nucleus, neurodevelopment, schizophrenia",

The sublentiform (SL) and olivary (ON) nuclei receive projections from the visual cortex, superior colliculus (SC) and an equal bilateral projection from the retina. The nucleus of the posterior commissure (NPC) and its subdivisions do not receive any of these inputs. The projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input (i.e., SL and ON) and the region which does not (i.e., nucleus of the posterior commissure, NPC). For example, while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the SC, accessory oculomotor nuclei, reticular formation, intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus, it is only the retino-recipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei, the lateral pulvinar, the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar, the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta and other structures. It is concluded that the retina, SC and cortex which influence the visceral oculomotor nuclei can only do so by virtue of their projections to the pretectum, and that any consideration of accommodative and pupillary reflexes must view the pretectum as an obligatory link through which various structures can influence the intrinsic musculature of the eye. In contrast to the SC, the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus, such as the inferior pulvinar, which project to the visual cortices. Instead, the pretectum projects directly to visuomotor, visceromotor and arousal systems.",,

The retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons formed longitudinal bands, some of which crossed the internal medullary lamina, and extended from one thalamic nucleus into another. On the basis of these findings the frontal cortex was subdivided into seven transverse cortical strips which receive afferents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The most rostral transverse strip receives afferents from the most medial thalamic band which is oriented vertically and extends through the most medial part of the MD into the medial pulvinar. Progressively more caudally located transverse strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands which in part are situated in the VL and show an increasing tilt towards the horizontal. Moreover, those parts of the various bands which are situated along the dorsal and lateral margin of the thalamus project to the medial portions of the transverse cortical strips, i.e. along the medial margin of the frontal lobe, while the other parts situated ventromedially in the thalamus project to the lateral portions of these strips, i.e. along the lateral margin of the frontal lobe. These data provide an alternative view of the organization of the thalamus and suggest that this structure contains a matrix of longitudinal cell columns which in some cases extend across specific nuclear borders and may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the thalamo-cortical connexions.",,

The proposed changes in nomenclature are based on the analysis of topographical relationships between nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar projections to the thalamus studied in 13 rhesus monkeys with the use of autoradiography technique. Mapping of the projection zones of these motor-related systems in serial sagittal sections revealed that they are completely segregated with each honoring cytoarchitectonic boundaries of specific nuclear subdivisions. The available data on thalamic connectivity together with the results of the present study allowed us to divide the primate “motor” thalamus into two major territories: (1) the ventral anterior region (VA) and (2) the ventral lateral region (VL). Although the designation of these two areas of the motor thalamus is the same as the classic one, the nuclear subdivisions that compose them differ significantly from those described in previous classifications. As is delineated in the maps, VA represents the basal ganglia territory of the motor thalamus where nigral projections coincide with its magnocellular part (VAmc), and pallidal projections occupy densicellular (VAdc) and parvicellular (VApc) subdivisions. VAdc corresponds closely to VLo of Olszewski; however, we prefer the new term in order to avoid possible conceptual confusions with the ventral lateral region (VL), which does not receive basal ganglia projections. The VL region is characterized as a distinct cytoarchitectonic entity of the motor thalamus that receives cerebellar projections and includes area X, VPLo, VLc, and VLps of Olszewski. The ventral medial region (VM in the present study or VLm in Olszewski terminology) is usually considered together with the basal ganglia territory on a common connectional basis. However, we did not obtain convincing data to support this view, since evidence of terminal labeling was observed only in (or around) fiber bundles passing through the nucleus with other areas free of label. Rather, in this study VM was treated as an intermediate zone between the subthalamus and motor thalamus where fiber bundles from basal ganglia and cerebellum are organized in a topographical manner before reaching their destinations in the VA and VL regions, respectively. Other major thalamic regions represented in the maps were delineated purely on cytoarchitectonic grounds and their traditional nomenclature was maintained. In this respect the present maps can be considered as a supplement to the available cytoarchitectonic atlases of the monkey thalamus since the latter lack sagittal Plates. Additionally, the present atlas is constructed within an intracerebral coordinate system that relies on anterior and posterior brain commissures as landmarks. Thus it can be used as a guide for stereotactic placements in the thalamus by means of a recently developed technique that utilizes contrast ventriculography for the visualization of these landmarks. The advantages of this stereotactic technique and its superior accuracy compared to the conventional stereotactic methods have been demonstrated earlier.",,

Extracellular action potentials were recorded from single neurons in the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial (VPMpc) nucleus of the thalamus of restrained, but alert, Old World monkeys during gustatory, tactile, and thermal stimulation of the oral cavity. In contrast to previous reports in anesthetized or paralyzed rats, the spontaneous activity of these neurons was brisk and their evoked responses robust. 2. Each of 50 taste-responsive neurons was tested with 1.0 M sucrose, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.003 M HCl, and 0.001 M QHCl before other concentrations of the same stimuli were used. Sucrose, which was effective in 80% of the neurons tested, evoked the largest responses of the 4 standard gustatory stimuli (16.1 spikes/s). The average response to NaCl, an effective stimulus for 44% of the neurons in the sample, was 7.5 spikes/s. HCl and QHCl, which few neurons responded to, typically evoked smaller responses. 3. Most of the neurons tested showed monotonic intensity-response (I-R) functions. The power functions showed about the same degree of compression (range = 0.39-0.53), which has been described previously for brain stem neurons in anesthetized rodents. Only 9.1% of the responses were inhibitory, and there was no tendency for these responses to be associated with either specific neurons or stimuli. These data suggest that quality coding of gustatory information in the thalamus is not radically different from that seen among lower-order neurons in other species. 4. Through the use of hierarchical cluster analysis, it was possible to divide the neuron sample into 2 groups, one of which consisted of sucrose-best neurons that had an average entropy value of 0.56. The neurons in the other group, though more heterogeneous, showed either primary or side-band sensitivity to NaCl. The average breadth of responsiveness of the 50 thalamic neurons as described by the entropy coefficient was 0.73. 5. In addition to gustatory neurons, tactile (n = 15), thermal (n = 1), and nonresponsive (n = 25) neurons also were located within VPMpc. An additional 48 neurons that could not be classified as either sensory or motor in nature, inhibited their bursting spontaneous discharge just prior to the onset of fluid stimulation. Only 2 of these neurons demonstrated differential chemical sensitivity. The presence of these nongustatory neurons within the thalamic taste area suggests that the traditional characterization of VPMpc as a gustatory relay may understate its role in ingestive behavior and ignore other noningestive functions of the area.",,

Nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were found in the periphery of the contralateral integument compartment of the VB complex. Thus, they formed a shell at the perimeter of this compartment with a somatotopic organization. The compartment consisted of large parts of nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc). NS neurons were located more caudally than WDR neurons. In the NS zone of VPM, the forehead was represented caudally, and oral structures rostrally. In the ventral NS zone of VPM, there was a sequential representation of the tongue, gum and mandibular skin from the medial to the lateral edge. The hand was represented medially in the NS zone of VPLc, and its representation dominated in the rostral NS zone. There was a sequential representation of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal segments mediolaterally along the dorsal VPLc. In the medial half of ventral NS zone of VPLc, the upper body half was represented, and in the lateral half, the lower body half. The foot was represented at or near the medial edge of lateral half.

Twelve monkeys were trained to pull a handle given one colour cue and to turn it given another. Bilateral lesions were then placed in the ventral thalamus. Four monkeys with large anterior lesions including the VA nucleus and the anterior part of VLo were severely impaired at relearning the task. Monkeys with small lesions in VAmc or with lesions centred on VLo were not impaired. The analysis of the histology suggests that the impairment in the four monkeys did not result from involvement of the cerebellar relay through nucleus X. It is argued that the animals are not impaired because of faulty execution. This suggests that the basal ganglia have an influence on motor learning.,,

Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (S2), the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration. S2 was shown to receive its major thalamic input from the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPI) and not, as previously reported, from the caudal division of the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPLc). Following small injections of isotope or HRP into the hand representation of S2, only VPI was labeled. Larger injections, which included the representations of more body parts, led to heavy label in VPI, with scattered label in VPLc, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the posterior nucleus (Po). In addition, small isotope injections into VPLc did not result in label in S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site, and ablations of S2 led to cell loss in VPI. Comparison of injections involving different body parts in S2 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within VPI such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially. The location of the thalamic representations of the head, face, and intraoral structures that project to S2 may be in the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPM). The granular (Ig) and dysgranular (Id) fields of the insula and the retroinsular field (Ri) each receive inputs from a variety of nuclei located at the posteroventral border of the thalamus. Ig receives its heaviest input from the suprageniculate-limitans complex (SG-Li), with additional inputs from Po, the magnocellular division of the medial geniculate n. (MGmc), VPI, and the medial pulvinar (Pulm). Id receives its heaviest input from the basal ventromedial n. (VMb), with additional inputs from VPI, Po, SG-Li, MGmc, and Pulm. Ri receives its heaviest input from Po, with additional input from SG-Li, MGmc, Pulm, and perhaps VPI. Area 7b receives its input from Pulm, the oral division of the pulvinar, the lateral posterior n., the medial dorsal n., and the caudal division of the ventrolateral n. These results indicate that the somatic cortical fields, except for those comprising the first somatosensory area, each receive inputs from an array of thalamic nuclei, rather than just one, and that individual thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei each project to more than one cortical field.",,

The cerebellar nuclei give rise to a massive projection to the contralateral midbrain and thalamus via the ascending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle. Cerebellar efferent fibers terminate contralaterally in both divisions of the red nucleus, and bilaterally in the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, the oculomotor nucleus, and the central gray. All the deep cerebellar nuclei project upon a broad area of the contralateral ventral thalamus as well as certain intralaminar nuclei. Corresponding ipsilateral thalamic terminations are sparse. The topograpic organization of cerebellothalamic fibers does not correspond to individual cerebellar nuclei or to cytoarchitectonic divisions of the ventral thalamic nuclei. Rather there are longitudinally oriented strips of terminal labeling which extend through all divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus, i.e., the VLps, the VLc, the VLo, as well as nucleus X, the oral division of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the most caudal region of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA). The topography of the cerebellothalamic fibers is arranged in a mediolateral pattern with fibers originating from anterior zones of the dentate and interpositus ending most laterally and those from posterior dentate and interpositus terminating most medially. The fastigial contribution is relatively sparse. The longitudinal strips of terminal labeling in the ventral thalamic nuclei are made up of still smaller terminal units consisting of disk-like aggregates of silver grains separated from one another by grain-free spaces. The dorsal column nuclei terminate primarily in the contralateral caudal division of the VPL (VPLc) and never extend rostrally into VPLo. These results demonstrate a segregation of cerebellar and dorsal columnar inputs to motor and sensory regions of the thalamus, respectively. Since these regions are separate and discrete in their cortical associations as well (Kalil, 1976), it seems unlikely that fast afferent pathways relaying to motor cortex (Lemon and Porter, 1976) could arise from the dorsal column nuclei.",,

II. Vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence at thalamic neurons,"The vestibular thalamic relay in the Rhesus ventrobasal complex, identified in a previous field potential study (part I, Deecke et al., 1974), has now been investigated with neuronal recordings in the thalamus in order to clarify its functional role. In part I, short latency responses (2.5 msec) were found in the corner between VPL, VPM and VPI nuclei, largely including dorsal portions of the VPI nucleus. Field potentials of somewhat longer latency (4–5 msec) were recorded in VPL and in other thalamic nuclei, including the posterior nuclear group. Neuronal responses were recorded in thalamic nuclei of awake flaxedilized Rhesus monkeys. Cells not responding to vestibular stimulation (round window polarisation of either labyrinth) were ignored. The great majority (80%) of those neurons responding to labyrinth polarisation showed convergence with deep somatic (proprioceptive) input from joints and muscles of vertebral column and limbs. 60% of these bimodal neurons responded to movement of cervical joints. Very few vestibularly responsive cells received cutaneous (6.6%), non-optokinetic visual or auditory (2.6% each) input. Proprioceptive fields tended to be large, frequently involving more than one joint, and could be even bilateral. For a few cells the pattern of vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence could be fitted to a coordinated body position that might occur during normal locomotion. 78% of the cells responded to polarisation of both labyrinths, indicating strong bilateral projection.",,

In addition to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of MD, three other subdivisions can be recognized on the basis of myeloarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and connections. The first two of these represent a parcellation of the magnocellular division into a lateral, fiber-rich MD pars fibrosa and a medial, poorly myelinated MD pars paramediana adjacent to the midline. The third is a small, poorly myelinated area located at the caudomedial and dorsal edges of MD; it is referred to as MD pars caudodorsalis. MD pars fibrosa is reciprocally interconnected primarily with areas 11, 12 and 13 in the central and lateral part of the orbital cortex. There is a general organization within this projection, with the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex represented from dorsal to ventral in the pars fibrosa, and the mediolateral cortical axis represented from medial to lateral. Cells that project to area 12 also extend laterally into the adjacent pars parvicellularis. MD pars paramediana is more heavily interconnected with the caudal and medial portions of the orbital region, particularly the agranular insular areas and the caudal parts of areas 13 and 14. Cells that project to two caudal areas, 13a and Iad, do not fit with the general organization, in that they are located in the dorsomedial parts of the pars fibrosa and pars paramediana, where they overlap with cells that project to area 14. The pars fibrosa and pars paramediana receive inputs from areas of the ventral forebrain such as the amygdala, piriform (olfactory) cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, as well as from the ventral pallidum. MD pars caudodorsalis is reciprocally interconnected with areas 14, 24, and 32 on the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex. In this part of the nucleus the dorsoventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is represented from caudal to rostral in the thalamus. The amygdala and other ventral forebrain structures do not send fibers into the pars caudodorsalis, even though some of these structures project directly to the medial prefrontal cortex. Ventral to MD, and separated from it by the internal medullary lamina, a small region was recognized that appears to be comparable to the anteroventral part of the submedial nucleus previously defined in the rat and cat. This region receives input from the piriform cortex and is interconnected with orbital cortical area 13a. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

In the present study WGA-HRP injections were placed in the different subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey to determine whether a similarly complex pattern also exists in the thalamocortical pathway. Additionally, in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe, multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Different subdivisions of the parietal lobe appear to receive different sets of thalamic input. Thus the superior parietal lobule (SPL) projections are derived from more lateral regions in the thalamus, arising predominantly from the lateral posterior (LP) and pulvinar oralis (PO) nuclei, with additional contributions from the pulvinar lateralis (PL) and pulvinar medialis (PM) nuclei. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), by contrast, receives its projections from more medial thalamic regions, its main thalamic input originating from PM, and aided by LP, PL, and PO. Both the SPL and IPL also receive projections from the mediodorsal (MD), ventroposterior, ventrolateral, intralaminar, and limbic nuclei, albeit from different components within these nuclei. A topographical arrangement also exists in the thalamic projections to the rostral versus the caudal subdivisions of both the SPL and the IPL. Thus, in the SPL, the ventral posterolateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo), ventral lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VLo), and ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis (VLm) project to rostral, whereas the PM and limbic nuclei, anteroventral (AV), and anteromedial (AM), project to area PGm on the medial convexity of the SPL. With respect to projections to the IPL, the ventral posteromedial (VPM) and PO nuclei project to rostral regions, whereas the limbic nuclei lateral dorsal (LD), AM and AV project only to the caudalmost area, Opt. A rostrocaudal difference is reflected also within certain nuclei (LP, PO, and PM) that project to the SPL or IPL. Thus rostral parietal subdivisions receive projections from ventral regions within these thalamic nuclei, whereas caudal parietal afferents arise from the dorsal parts of these nuclei. Intervening cortical levels receive projections from intermediate positions within the nuclei. It therefore seems that the increasing architectonic and functional complexity as one moves from rostral to caudal in the SPL and IPL appear to be reflected in the thalamic afferents. More rostral areas relate to modality-specific thalamic nuclei, whereas more caudal regions concerned with complex functions derive their input from multimodal and limbic nuclei.",,

The interrelationship of medial area 6 (supplementary motor area) with the thalamus was investigated by means of anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. Nine monkeys were prepared for autoradiography or histochemistry with the marker HRP conjugated to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Three of the monkeys received injections into the precentral cortex for comparison. 2. Previous observations were confirmed that the thalamic relays to the motor areas are organized as crescent-shaped lamellae which transgress cytoarchitectonic boundaries. The thalamic VA-VL complex receiving fibres from areas 4 and medial area 6 also sends fibres to these same areas. 3. The thalamic relay to medial area 6 comprised the following subdivisions: VLo, VLc, area X of Olszewski, VLm and, to a smaller extent VA. 4. Labeling (mostly anterograde only) was also prominent in some thalamic compartments outside the ‘motor’ thalamus: R, CL, CM-Pf, MD, LP, PULo. 5. It was noted that rostral and caudal injections into the medial area 6 resulted in different thalamic labeling: The rostral portion was found to be related mainly with VApc, area X and VLc, the central portion with VLo, and the caudal portion with VLc/VLo. This structural inhomogeneity may reflect also a functional rostro-caudal differentiation of the medial area 6. 6. The thalamic territory projecting to the precentral cortex is separate from the above relay and includes principally VPLo. 7. The present anatomical labeling study is in agreement with the conclusion of Schell and Strick (1984) that the SMA, especially its central portion, is an important target of basal ganglia outflow via the thalamic relay VLo. In addition consistent labeling was also found in thalamic subdivisions (area X, VLc) which had been found to receive cerebellar fibres.",,

Although it has been shown that both the cortical and thalamic representations can reorganize, uncertainties exist regarding the extent, nature, and time course of changes at each level. We have determined how cortical representations in the somatosensory area 3b and the ventroposterior (VP) nucleus of thalamus are affected by long standing unilateral dorsal column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys. In monkeys with recovery periods of 22–23 months, the intact face inputs expanded into the deafferented hand region of area 3b after complete or partial lesions of the dorsal columns. The expansion of the face region could extend all the way medially into the leg and foot representations. In the same monkeys, similar expansions of the face representation take place in the VP nucleus of the thalamus, indicating that both these processing levels undergo similar reorganizations. The receptive fields of the expanded representations were similar in somatosensory cortex and thalamus. In two monkeys, we determined the extent of the brain reorganization immediately after dorsal column lesions. In these monkeys, the deafferented regions of area 3b and the VP nucleus became unresponsive to the peripheral touch immediately after the lesion. No reorganization was seen in the cortex or the VP nucleus. A comparison of the extents of deafferentation across the monkeys shows that even if the dorsal column lesion is partial, preserving most of the hand representation, it is sufficient to induce an expansion of the face representation.","plasticity, spinal cord injury, dorsal column, primate, microelectrode, mapping, receptive field",

The thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. Modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant in the rodent thalamus. We show that dopaminergic axons profusely target the human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). The dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. We also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. The origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. We propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Investigating this “thalamic dopaminergic system” should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","dopamine, dopamine transporter, dopaminergic systems, thalamus, human, monkey",

Inferior area 6 has been further subdivided into two histochemical areas: area F5, located along the inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus, and area F4, located between area F5 and area 4 (area F1). The present study traced the thalamocortical projections of inferior area 6 and the adjacent part of area 4 by injecting small amounts of WGA-HRP in specific sectors of the agranular frontal cortex. Our data showed that each histochemical area receives a large projection from one nucleus of the ventrolateral thalamus (motor thalamus) and additional projections from other nuclei of this thalamic sector. Area F5 receives a large projection from area X of Olszewski ('52) and additional projections from the caudal part of the nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), and the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) (VPLo-VLc complex). Area F4 receives a large projection from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and additional projections from area X and the VPLo-VLc complex. The rostral part of area F1 is innervated chiefly by VLo, plus smaller contributions from rostral VPLo and the VPLo-VLc complex. The caudal part of F1 receives its greatest input from VPLo, with a small contribution from VLo. In addition, each histochemical area receives projections originating from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the posterior thalamus, and–for area F4 and area F5–also from the nucleus medialis dorsalis (MD). Analysis of the physiological properties of the various histochemical areas in relation to their main thalamic input showed that those cortical fields in which distal movements are predominant (area F5, caudal part of area F1) are innervated chiefly by area X and VPLo, wheras those cortical fields in which proximal movements are predominant receive their main input from VLo. Because VPLo and area X are targets of cerebellothalamic pathways, whereas VLo receives a pallidal input, we propose that the cortical fields in which distal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the cerebellum, whereas the cortical fields in which proximal movements are most heavily represented are mainly under the influence of the basal ganglia.",,

Subcortical pathways and topography of striatal and thalamic terminal fields,"Anterograde tracers (tritiated leucine, proline, fucose; WGA-HRP) were injected into sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) of nine macaque monkeys. Low thresholds (≤50 μA) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. Dorsomedial prearcuate injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as lFEF cases, whereas ventrolateral prearcuate sites where small saccades were evoked were designated sFEF cases. One control case was injected in the medial postarcuate area 6. We found five descending fiber bundles from FEF; fibers to the striatum, which enter the caudate nucleus at or just rostral to the genu of the internal capsule; fibers to the claustrum, which travel in the external capsule; and transthalamic, subthalamic, and pedunculopontine fibers. Our results indicate that transthalamic and subthalamic pathways supply all terminal sites in the thalamus, subthalamus, and tegmentum of the midbrain and pons, whereas pedunculopontine fibers appear to terminate in the pontine and reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus exclusively. Frontal eye field terminal fields in the striatum were topographically organized: lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Thus, lFEF terminal fields were located centrally in the head and body of the caudate nucleus and a small dorsomedial portion of the putamen, whereas sFEF terminal fields were located in ventrolateral parts of the caudate body and ventromedial parts of the putamen. In the claustrum, lFEF projections terminated dorsal and rostral to sFEF projections. Projections from FEF terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography. By comparison, terminal fields from medial postarcuate area 6 were located more caudally and laterally in the striatum and claustrum than projections from FEF, and more centrally in the subthalamic nucleus. In the thalamus, FEF terminal patches in some thalamic nuclei were also topographically organized. Projections from lFEF terminated in dorsal area X, dorsolateral medial dorsal nucleus, pars parvicellularis (MDpc), and the caudal pole of MDpc, whereas projections from sFEF terminated in ventral area X, medial dorsal nucleus, pars multiformis, and caudal medial dorsal nucleus pars densocellularis. Characteristically, projections from postarcuate area 6 terminated in central ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis. Projections from dorsomedial postarcuate area 6 terminated in the paracentral and central lateral nuclei.",,

AChE histochemistry is very useful in delineating the thalamic nuclei connected with the association cortex and in uncovering thalamic subdivisions that are barely evident on cytoarchitectonic grounds. Moreover, AChE activity reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneities within several thalamic nuclei, like the ventral anterior (VA), where a new ventromedial subdivision (VAvm) is described, the medial pulvinar (PuIM) or the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In this nucleus three distinct chemical domains are present: the medial, ventral and lateral sectors characterized by low, moderate and high AChE activities, respectively. The staining pattern of the lateral sector is markedly heterogeneous with patches of intense AChE activity surrounded by a moderately stained matrix. The MD medial sector is connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the AChE-rich patches in the lateral sector are selectively connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal association cortices. In the PulM, a dorsomedial AChE-rich patch is selectively connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the surrounding territory, which shows moderate AChE activity, is preferentially connected with the parietal and temporal cortices. Chemically specific domains in the anterior, ventral anterior, midline, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are also connected with the examined association cortices. These findings indicate that the topographic patterns of the thalamo-cortical connections of primate association areas conform to the chemical architecture of the thalamus. This implies that because each cortical area is connected to a particular set of thalamic regions, the influence of the thalamus on cortical function is exclusive for each area, highly diverse among the various association areas, and subject to a wide range of modulation at the thalamic level.","Mediodorsal nucleus; Medial pulvinar nucleus; Anterior thalamic nuclei; Midline thalamic nuclei; Intralaminar thalamic nuclei; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; AD, anterodorsal nucleus; AM, anteromedial nucleus; AMdc, anteromedial nucleus, densocellular part; AV, anteroventral nucleus; Cdc, central nucleus, densocellular part; CeM, central medial nucleus; Cif, central nucleus, inferior part; Cim, central nucleus, intermediate part; CL, central lateral nucleus; Clc, central nucleus, latocellular part; CnMd, centromedian nucleus; Cs, central nucleus, superior part; Csl, central nucleus, superior lateral part; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HRP-WGA, peroxidase labeled wheat germ agglutinin; LD, lateral dorsal nucleus; Li, nucleus limitans; LP, lateral posterior nucleus; MD, mediodorsal nucleus; MDI, mediodorsal nucleus, lateral sector; MDm, mediodorsal nucleus, medial sector; MDv, mediodorsal nucleus, ventral sector; Pcn, paracentral nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; Pt, paratenial nucleus; Pull, inferior pulvinar nucleus; PulM, medial pulvinar nucleus; PulL, lateral pulvinar nucleus; Pv, paraventricular nucleus; R, reticular nucleus; Re, nucleus reuniens; SG, suprageniculate nucleus; STP, superior temporal polysensory area; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine; VA, ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc, ventral anterior nucleus, magnocellular subdivision; VApc, ventral anterior nucleus, parvocellular subdivision; VAvm, ventral anterior nucleus, ventromedial subdivision; VLo, ventral lateral nucleus, oral subdivision;",

The results indicate that in addition to its well-known connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, MDm receives fibers from many parts of the basal forebrain, including the ventral pallidum and other parts of the substantia innominata, the amygdaloid complex, the primary olfactory cortex, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and the cortex at the pole of the temporal lobe. Lighter projections arise in the subiculum, the ventral insula, and the superior and inferior temporal gyri. The cells that project to MDm tend to be large, polymorphic neurons. Throughout most of the basal forebrain they are diffusely distributed through several nuclei or cortical layers, without obvious relation to nuclear or laminar boundaries. The major exception to this is in the ventral pallidum, where there is a dense concentration of cells that project to MDm. The lateral part of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDl) receives few if any fibers from the basal forebrain and temporal lobe, but is innervated by several brainstem structures, especially the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the midbrain tegmental fields. In MDm, the fibers are distributed in irregular patches. Three-dimensional analysis indicates that these patches are often clustered into separate bands or columns at different anteroposterior levels. In addition, the strongest projections from the three major regions that innervate MDm are organized in a complex three-dimensional pattern. First, the fibers from the amygdaloid nuclei terminate most heavily (but not exclusively) in the rostral third of MDm. The parvicellular accessory basal amygdaloid nucleus and the amygdalohippocampal area project principally to the dorsal part of the nucleus. The parvicellular basal nucleus and the periamygdaloid cortex project to the ventromedial quadrant of MDm; and the magnocellular basal nucleus, the magnocellular accessory basal nucleus, and the lateral nucleus all project to the ventrolateral quadrant. Second, the substantia innominata projects preferentially to the caudal part of MDm. The medial part of the substantia innominata, especially the ventral pallidum, innervates the dorsomedial quadrant, while more caudal and lateral areas of this region project ventrolaterally. Third, the projections arising from the entorhinal and other temporal cortical areas terminate primarily in the mid-rostrocaudal level of MDm. Fibers from the entorhinal area tend to end dorsally, while those from the perirhinal cortex or the temporal polar cortex end more ventrally. Electrophysiological responses to stimulation of the olfactory bulb were found only in the anterior third of MDm. Responsive units were clustered in short zones along each electrode track, probably corresponding to the patches of afferent fibers seen with axonal tracers.",,

Inputs to different zones of motor, premotor, and postarcuate cortex, supplementary motor area, and areas 3b/1 and 2/5 in the postcentral cortex, were examined. Coincident labeling of thalamocortical neuron populations with different dyes (1) increased the precision with which their soma distributions could be related within thalamic space, and (2) enabled the detection by double labeling, of individual thalamic neurons that were common to the thalamic soma distributions projecting to separate, dye-injected cortical zones. Double-labeled thalamic neurons projecting to sensorimotor cortex were rarely seen in mature macaques, even when the injection sites were only 1–1.5 mm apart, implying that their terminal arborizations were quite restricted horizontally. By contrast, separate neuron populations in each thalamic nucleus with input to sensorimotor cortex projected to more than one cytoarchitecturally distinct cortical area. In ventral posterior lateral (oral) (VPLo), for example, separate populations of cells sent axons to precentral medial, and lateral area 4, medial premotor, and postarcuate cortex, as well as to supplementary motor area. Extensive convergence of thalamic input even to the smallest zones of dye uptake in the cortex (≈0.5 mm3) characterized the sensorimotor cortex. The complex forms of these projection territories were explored using 3-dimensional reconstructions from coronal maps. These projection territories, while highly ordered, were not contained by the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of individual thalamic nuclei. Their organization suggests that the integration of the diverse information from spinal cord, cerebellum, and basal ganglia that is needed in the execution of complex sensorimotor tasks begins in the thalamus.",,

Tritiated amino acid injections limited to the insula revealed autoradiographic label in the principal and parvicellular components of the ventroposterior medial nucleus, the ventroposterior inferior nucleus, the oral and medial pulvinar nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, the parvicellular and magnocellular components of the medial dorsal nucleus, the centromedian-parafasicularis nuclei, and the reticular nucleus. In additional animals, tritiated amino acids and horseradish perioxidase injections were made within different regions of the insula. Although the injection sites in these additional cases may have included minor extensions into claustrum and adjacent structures, several tentative conclusions emerged with respect to the antero-posterior gradient in insulothalamic connectivity. The anterior insula appears to have a more extensive relationship with the ventroposterior medial complex, the medial dorsal nucleus, the centromedian-parafasicularis nuclei and with some midline nuclei. In contrast, the posterior insula is more extensively connected with the ventroposterior inferior nucleus, the oral and medial pulvinar nuclei, and the suprageniculate nucleus. The patterns of insulothalamic connections support conclusions derived from observations on the cortical connectivity of the primate insular cortex indicating that the anterior insula is related to olfactory, gustatory, and viscero-autonomic behavior, whereas the posterior insula is related to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function (Mesulam and Mufson, '82b). The medial pulvinar nucleus has extensive connections with many paralimbic cortical regions including the insula as well as with high order polymodal association cortex. These findings suggest that the medial pulvinar may provide a region for the convergence of multisensory association input with limbic information.",,

It is not known however, whether contralateral thalamocortical projections reach particular cortices or whether they emanate from specific nuclei. In the rhesus monkey different types of cortices, ranging from transitional to eulaminate, vary in their cortical connectional pattern and may also differ in thier thalamic connections. Because olfactory and transitional prefrontal cortices receive widespread projections, we investaged whether they are the target of projections from the contralateral thalamus as well. With the aid of retrograde tracers, we studied the thalamic projections of primary olfactory (olfactory tubercle and prepiriform cortex) and transitional orbital (areas PAPP, Pro 13) and medial (areas 25, 24, 32) areas, and of eulaminate (areas 11, 12, 9) cortices for comparison. To determine the prevalence of neurons in the contralateral thalamus, we compared them with the ipsilateral in each case. The pattern of ipsilateral thalamic projections differed somewhat among orbital, medial, and olfactory cortices. The mediodorsal nucleus was the predominant source of projections to orbital areas, midline nuclei included consistently about 25% of the thalamic neurons directed to medial transitional cortices, and primary olfactory areas were distinguished by receiving thalamic projections predominantly from neurons in midline and intralaminar nuclei. Notwithstanding some broad differences in the ipsilateral thalamofrontal projections, which appeared to depend on cortical location, the pattern of contralateral projections was thalamus were noted in midline, the magnocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the anterior medial and intralaminar nuclei, and ranged from 0 to 14% of the ipsilateral; they were directed primarily to olfactory and transitional orbital and medical cortices but rarely projected to eulaminate areas. Several thalamic nuclei projected from both sides to olfactory and transitional areas, but issued only ipsilateral projections to eulaminate areas. Though ipsilateral thalamocortical projections predominate in adult mammalian species, crossed projections are a common feature in development. The results suggest differences in the persistence of contralateral thalamocortical interactions between transitional and eulaminate cortices. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,

Such dual pattern of corticothalamic projections is well established in rodents and cats for many cortical areas. In non-human primates (monkeys), it has been reported for the primary sensory cortices (A1, V1, S1), the motor and premotor cortical areas and, in the parietal lobe, also for area 7. The present study aimed first at refining the cytoarchitecture parcellation of area 5 into the sub-areas PE and PEa and, second, establishing whether area 5 also exhibits this dual pattern of corticothalamic projection and what is its precise topography. To this aim, the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected in area PE in one monkey and in area PEa in a second monkey. Area PE sends a major projection terminating with small endings to the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LP), ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL), medial pulvinar (PuM) and, but fewer, to ventral lateral posterior nucleus, dorsal division (VLpd), central lateral nucleus (CL) and center median nucleus (CM), whereas giant endings formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL and PuM. For area PEa, the corticothalamic projection formed by small endings was found mainly in LP, VPL, anterior pulvinar (PuA), lateral pulvinar (PuL), PuM and, to a lesser extent, in ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), CL, mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and CM. Giant endings originating from area PEa formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL, PuA, PuM, MD and PuL. Furthermore, the origin of the thalamocortical projections to areas PE and PEa was established, exhibiting clusters of neurons in the same thalamic nuclei as above, in other words predominantly in the caudal thalamus. Via the giant endings CT projection, areas PE and PEa may send feedforward, transthalamic projections to remote cortical areas in the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes contributing to polysensory and sensorimotor integration, relevant for visual guidance of reaching movements for instance.",parietal lobe; primate; thalamus; retrograde and anterograde tracing; axon terminal; BDA; AChE; acetylcholinesterase; BDA; biotinylated dextran amine; CL; central lateral nucleus; CM; center median nucleus; CT; corticothalamic; FEF; frontal eye field; FR; Fluro-Ruby; IPS; intraparietal sulcus; IT; infero-temporal area; LP; lateral posterior nucleus; MD; mediodorsal nucleus; MK1; monkey 1; MK2; monkey 2; PMd-c; caudal part of dorsal premotor cortex; PMd-r; rostral part of dorsal premotor cortex; PMv-c; caudal part of ventral premotor cortex; PMv-r; rostral part of ventral premotor cortex; Pu; pulvinar nucleus; PuA; anterior pulvinar; PuL; lateral pulvinar; PuM; medial pulvinar; TC; thalamocortical; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VLa; ventral lateral anterior nucleus; VPI; ventral posterior inferior nucleus; VPL; ventral posterior lateral nucleus; WGA; wheat germ agglutinin;,

The peripheral zone is located along the medial border and the fovea at the dorsolateral angle adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The superior colliculus also sends a dense projection to the ipsilateral intralaminar complex, i.e., to the parafascicular, central lateral and paracentral nuclei, and a lesser projection to the same contralateral nuclei. Degenerating tectal fibers were also found in the lateral geniculate nuclei. Four types of vesicle containing profiles were observed in the inferior pulvinar and paracentral nucleus. The large RL and small RS terminals contain round vesicles of uniform size and form asymmetric contacts mainly with large and small dendrites respectively. The F terminal contains a mixture of small round and flat vesicles. It forms symmetric contacts with dendrites and cell somata. The P profile is very pale and contains a relatively sparse population of vesicles showing a great variation in size. It forms symmetric contacts with medium to large dendrites. It is frequently found postsynaptic to the other types, especially the RL terminal, and is regularly seen as the intermediate element of serial and triadic synaptic arrangements. The experimental electron microscopic study has shown that many fibers from the superior colliculus terminate as RL profiles, undergoing direct dense degeneration, in both the inferior pulvinar and the paracentral nucleus. Others probably end as smaller RS terminals.",,

Their receptive fields were mapped and classified as corresponding to those of parvi- or magnocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. The axons were then impaled and injected intraaxonally with horseradish peroxidase. Two magnocellular (MA) and two parvicellular (PA) axons were successfully recovered and reconstructed in three dimensions. The two MA axons arborised mainly in layer 4Cβ, as did the two PA axons in layer 4Cβ. Few collaterals formed varicosities in layer 6. Both MA axons had two large, elongated clumps of bouton (approx. 300–500 × 600–1,200 μm each) and a small clump. One PA axon had two clumps (each with a core appr. 200 μm in diameter); the other had only one (appr. 150–200 μm in diameter). The PA axon with two clumps had 1,520 boutons; the other PA axon had 1,380; one MA axon had 3,200 boutons; and those of the more extensive MA axon were not counted. The distribution of postsynaptic targets as well as the number of synapses per bouton has been established for a sample of 150 PA boutons and 173 MA boutons from serial ultrathin sections. The MA axons made on average 2.1 synapses per bouton compared to 1.79 for one PA axon and 2.6 for the other. The sample of boutons taken from the two physiological types of axons contacted similar proportions of dendritic spines (52–68%), shafts (33–47%), and somata (0–3%). The postsynaptic elements were further characterized by immunostaining for GABA. All postsynaptic perikarya and some of the dendrites (4.5–9.5% of all targets) were positive for the amino acid. Near the thalamic synapse GABA-negative dendritic shafts frequently contained lamellar bodies, an organelle identical in structure to spine apparatus. Dendritic shafts and spines postsynaptic to the thalamocortical boutons frequently received an adjacent synapse from GABA-immunoreactive boutons. The similarity between the magno- and parvicellular axons in their targeting of postsynaptic elements, including the GABAergic neurons, suggests that the structural basis of the physiological differences between 4Cα and 4Cβ neurons should be sought in other aspects of the circuitry of layer 4C, such as local cortical circuits, or in the far greater horizontal extent of the thalamocortical and GABAergic axons in layer 4Cα compared to those in the β subdivision.",,

Different portions of the hand representation in area 3b were injected with different anatomical tracers in the same animal, or matched body part representations in parietal areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and areas 2 and 5 were injected with different anatomical tracers in the same animal to directly compare their thalamocortical connections. We found that the somatosensory thalamus is composed of several representations of cutaneous and deep receptors of the contralateral body. These nuclei include the ventral posterior nucleus, the ventral posterior superior nucleus, the ventral posterior inferior nucleus, and the ventral lateral nucleus. Each nucleus projects to several different cortical fields, and each cortical field receives projections from multiple thalamic nuclei. In contrast to other sensory systems, each of these somatosensory cortical fields is uniquely innervated by multiple thalamic nuclei. These data indicate that multiple inputs are processed simultaneously within and across several, “hierarchically connected” cortical fields.","area 1, area 2, area 5, posterior parietal cortex, topographic connections",

However, the underlying basis for this topography as it relates to the organization of the different architectonically defined areas of the prefrontal cortex has not been systematically studied. In the present investigation we have reassessed the thalamic projections from the different architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex by using the technique of autoradiography in the rhesus monkey. The results show that the prefrontomediodorsal projections are organized according to the architectonic differentiation of the prefrontal cortices. Thus architectonically less differentiated medial and orbital prefrontal regions project to the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision. In contrast, highly differentiated prefrontal area 8 projects to the most lateral sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the multiformis subdivision. Lateral prefrontal areas with intermediate architectonic features project to the central parvocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus. Additionally, these projections also reveal a dorsoventral topography. Thus areas in the medial and dorsolateral cortices project to the dorsal part of the mediodorsal nucleus. In contrast, areas in orbital and ventrolateral cortices project to the ventral part of the mediodorsal nucleus. The topographic organization of the corticothalamic connections described in this study corresponds to the progressive elaboration and differentiation of the architectonic features of the different prefrontal areas. This successive and dichotomous organization of prefrontothalamic connections may provide the basis for the observed differential functions of the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal nucleus.",,
