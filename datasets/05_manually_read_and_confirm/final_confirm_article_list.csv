Two distinct types of thalamic nucleus are proposed on the basis of the afferent fibres that they receive from ascending pathways and from the cerebral cortex First order nuclei receive primary afferent fibres definable on the basis of their origin and their intrathalamic synaptic relationships from ascending pathways These nuclei receive corticothalamic afferents from pyramidal cells in cortical layer  which also send branches to the thalamic reticular nucleus and appear to have a modulatory function Higher order nuclei receive most or all of their primary afferents from pyramidal cells in cortical layer  These resemble the ascending primary afferents in the first order nuclei in terms of fine structure synaptic relationships and in lacking a branch to the thalamic reticular nucleus The higher order nuclei also receive modulatory afferents from layer  It is proposed that the higher-order nuclei are largely concerned with transmitting information about the output of one cortical area to another cortical area and that they are likely to play a key role in corticocortical communication and higher cortical functions

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus; especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII; the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII; but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

The pulvinar is an associative thalamic nucleus meaning that most of its input and output relationships are formed with the cerebral cortex The function of this circuitry is little understood and its anatomy though much investigated is notably recondite This is because pulvinar connection patterns disrespect the architectural subunits anterior medial lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei that have been the traditional reference system This article presents a simplified global model of the organization of cortico-pulvinar connections so as to pursue their structure-function relationships Connections between the cortex and pulvinar are topographically organized and as a result the pulvinar contains a map of the cortical sheet However the topography is very blurred Hence the pulvinar connection zones of nearby cortical areas overlap allowing indirect transcortical communication via the pulvinar A general observation is that indirect cortico-pulvino-cortical circuits tend to mimic direct cortico-cortical pathways this is termed the replication principle It is equally apt for certain pairs or groups of nearby cortical areas that happen not to connect with each other The replication of this non-connection is achieved by discontinuities and dislocations of the cortical topography within the pulvinar such that the associated pair of connection zones do not overlap Certain of these deformations can be used to divide the global cortical topography into specific sub-domains which form the natural units of a connectional subdivision of the pulvinar A substantial part of the pulvinar also expresses visual topography reflecting visual maps in occipital cortex There are just two well-ordered visual maps in the pulvinar that both receive projections from area V and several other occipital areas the resulting duplication of cortical topography means that each visual map also acts as a separate connection domain In summary the model identifies four topographically ordered connection domains and reconciles the coexistence of visual and cortical maps in two of them The replication principle operates at and below the level of domain structure It is argued that cortico-pulvinar circuitry replicates the pattern of cortical circuitry but not its function playing a more regulatory role instead Thalamic neurons differ from cortical neurons in their inherent rhythmicity and the pattern of cortico-thalamic connections must govern the formation of specific resonant circuits The broad implication is that the pulvinar acts to coordinate cortical information processing by facilitating and sustaining the formation of synchronized trans-areal assemblies a more pointed suggestion is that owing to the considerable blurring of cortical topography in the pulvinar rival cortical assemblies may be in competition to recruit thalamic elements in order to outlast each other in activity

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study; wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain; especially the temporal lobe and thalamus; were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp; ictal and cortical electroencephalography; MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients; Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition; hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however; corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor. This finding may aid in the lateralization of seizure foci or; interictal brain SPECT.	temporal lobe epilepsy; diaschisis; interictal brain SPECT; CROSSED CEREBELLAR DIASCHISIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; AMYGDALA; PROJECTIONS; SEIZURES; SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN

The hypothesis that the six cytoarchitectonically distinct subdivisions of the zona incerta send efferent projections to different parts of the brain was tested using retrograde fluorescent tracing techniques Injections of tracer in the superior colliculus pontomesencephalic tegmentum thalamus or spinal cord resulted in characteristic and distinctive patterns of labelling in the zona incerta suggesting that the different subdivisions of the zona incerta give rise to different sets of efferent projections Thus injections into the deep layers of the superior colliculus resulted in retrogradely labelled neurons predominantly in the zona incerta pars ventralis whereas injections into the pontomesencephalic tegmentum avoiding the superior colliculus labelled neurons mostly in the zona incerta pars dorsalis Parafascicular thalamic injections resulted in labelled neurons in the zona incerta pars rostropolaris pars dorsalis pars caudalis and a few in the pars ventralis The spinal cord injections labelled predominantly the magnocellular cells of the zona incerta The results of the double labelling experiment also give support to the conclusion that different areas of the zona incerta give rise to largely individual sets of efferent projections Combined injections of tracers into the superior colliculus and thalamus resulted in the labelling of two essentially independent cell groups the tectal projecting cells being found mainly in the zona incerta pars ventralis and the thalamic projecting cells being found in the zona incerta pars rostropolaris pars dorsalis and pars caudalis However a small number of double labelled cells was found These cells which presumably send collateral projections to both the tectum and the thalamus were found mainly in the dorsal part of the zona incerta pars ventralis immediately next to the pars dorsalis In the light of these findings it would appear that the zona incerta may be organised into largely distinct subdivisions each of which has its own set of cytoarchitectonic and efferent projection characteristics

retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient nuclei of the pretectal complex and layers of the superior colliculus to the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar in the macaque monkey	The organization of five projections from the retinorecipient and non-retinorecipient layers of the superior colliculus SC and nuclei of the pre-tectum to the lateral pulvinar medial pulvinar and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus DLG of the thalamus in the macaque monkey were established by using both anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde horseradish perox-idase tracing techniques Some projections from these midbrain regions to the inferior pulvinar are also described as are projections to the thalamus from the tectorccipient parabigeminal nucleus First the retinorecipient and nonretinorecipient pretectal nuclei and SC layers were determined by Nissl stains myelin stains and the distribution of label resulting from intraocular injections of tritiated amino acids The possible projections of these pre-tectal nuclei layers of the SC as well as the parabigeminal nucleus to the pulvinar and DLG were then determined by both horseradish peroxidase and autoradiographic tracing methods The retinal projections to the SC extend throughout layers II-l II- II- and dorsal III with obvious patches in layers II-l and II- as described before by others There were a number of pretectal nuclei which also had connections with the retina In the nomenclature adopted these include the sublentiform nucleus the nucleus of the optic tract not to be confused with the thalamic limitansnucleus the posterior orprincipal pretectalnucleus and the laminatedolivary nucleus with a head and tail The nucleus of the posterior commissure and the nucleus of the pretectal area do not receive retinal projections The retinorecipient midbrain regions which project to the pulvinar are as follows Aside from a complicated multifocal projection to the inferior pulvinar the superficial retinorecipient SC layers project to three terminal foci or zones in one or more of the lateral pulvinar subdivisions alpha beta and gamma Rezak and Benevento  Focus  lies mainly along the dorso-ventral lateral border of subdivisions of PL-gamma and PL-beta extending ventrally to PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- and III Focus  occu-pies the lateral  of PL-alpha and arises from SC layers II- II- and III There is a topographical arrangement to the SC projections to foci  and  which may reflect a representation of more than two visual quadrants in the lateral pulvinar Focus  which consists of several clusters is located medially in PL-gamma and PL-beta and overlaps their mutual border with the medial pul-vinar Focus  is complicated as it is made up of a mixed input from the retinorecipient superficial and nonretinorecipient deep SC layers The portion of focus  located along the medial edge of the lateral pulvinar arises mainly from SC layers II- II- and III while the portion of the focus located along the adjacent lateral edge of the medial pulvinar arises mainly from SC layersIV V and VI These projections to the pulvinar from the superficial SC differ in their origins from those to the DLG which arise mainly from smaller cells in SC sublayer II- The nonretinorecipient SC projections to the pulvinar arise mainly from the deep layers ie IV V and VI and end in focus  within the medial pulvinar and the caudal oral pulvinar The projection from the deep SC layer to the medial half of focus  in the medial pulvinar has already been described above A pretectal projection to the lateral pulvinar from the retinorecipient region consisting of the nucleus of the optic tract the sublentiform nucleus and the posterior pretectal nucleus collectively called SL in our previous study Benevento et al b was confirmed This projection forms a focus focus  in the dorsal shoulder of the rostral lateral pulvinar which extends over foci  and  Our HRP data indicate that these pretectal nuclei might have convergent projections with the SC to foci  to  and the DLG How- ever because of the problem of interruption of fibers of passage this inter- pretation of convergent projections should be viewed with caution The HRP studies also indicate that the parabigeminal nucleus which is inter- connected with the SC projects to the thalamus as it contained a modest number of labelled cells after injections of the inferior pulvinar and focus  in PL-alpha but only a sparse number after injections of the DLG and focus  These results suggest that direct retinal influences can be relayed to visually responsive association cortex via retino-tectal-lateral pulvinar retino-pretectal-lateral pulvinar and retino-tecto-parabigeminal-lateral pulvinar routes in addition to the retino-tectal-geniculate and retino-tectal-inferior pulvinar routes In addition visuomotor and polysensory information influences thalamocortical systems via projections from the deep layers of the SC to the medial pulvinar When these findings are compared with the known organization of pulvinocortical interconnections one can conclude that the cortex of all four neocortical lobes can be influenced rather directly by the midbrain The response properties of the various cortical visual areas thus need not depend solely upon the corticocortical projections

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools; the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan); which used different nomenclatures. In fact; the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic; rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique; comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region; we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures; and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region; a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus'; the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II); the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions; rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar; pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense; in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape; strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory; primarily dentate; also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei; the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape; its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces; can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e'; object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory; in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped; strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension; and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex; the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections; the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory; and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories; is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex; in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal; cerebellar; pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt; caudalis-intermedia-oralis; to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL); which is the main source to the motor cortex; and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus; comprising twelve levels; is presented; with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.	primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI
9				MB	Y	D	review of motor thalamus, not sure if much of connectivity is involved	10.1016/0165-0173(96)00003-3			https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0165017396000033	://linkinghub.elsevier.com/	The primate motor thalamus	The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis

oxidase patches: a new cytoarchitectonic feature of monkey visual cortex	In normal macaque monkeys a histochemical stain for cytochrome oxidase activity revealed a striking pattern of regularly spaced patches in primary visual striate area  V cortex The patches were most obvious in layers II and III but also in layers I IV b V and VI only in layers IV c and IV a were they absent The patches were oval shaped about  by  pm and aligned into rows spaced about  pm apart Along each row a patch was located about every  pm often patches in neighbouring rows were aligned creating a square array T heir density was about one patch per  mm  by  pm in opercular cortex The patches were also labelled preferentially by stains for lactate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase acetylcholinesterase AChE and myelin In V a coarser pattern of broad parallel stripes labelled by cytochrome oxidase lactate dehydrogenase and AChE was present The cytochrome oxidase patches were absent in non-prim ate species like the cat mink tree shrew mouse rat rabbit and ground squirrel However they were present in all prim ate species examined including the rhesus cynomolgus owl and squirrel monkey baboon bushbaby and hum an While more species should be tested it appears that the patches are a cytoarchitectonic feature unique to prim ate visual cortex In the owl monkey patches of anterogradely transported horseradish peroxidase HRP were found in layers IV ca III and II after injection of the tracer into the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn They coincided exactly with the position of patches in adjacent sections processed for cytochrome oxidase A similar result was obtained in the macaque except that patches were not present in layer IV ca These experiments established that the cytochrome oxidase patches receive a direct patchy projection from the lateral geniculate body However retrogradely filled layer VI cells in the owl monkey bore no regular relation to the patches In the macaque the honeycomb of geniculate terminals in layer IV a matched a similar honeycomb pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining In the Nissl stain three sublayers in layer IV a were identified the honeycomb was located in layer IV ap In V in the owl monkey the parallel stripes of enhanced cytochrome oxidase activity received a direct projection from lgn or pulvinar In the macaque after intraocular injection of Hproline the rows of patches in layers II and III lay in register with ocular dominance columns seen by transneuronal radioautography in layer IV c In another macaque one eye was removed and the cortex stained for cytochrome oxidase AChE and Nissl substance after six months survival In layer IV c light and dark bands corresponding to the ocular dominance columns were visible surprisingly the dark cytochrome oxidase bands matched the light AChE and Nissl bands The set of bands belonging to the missing eye was determined by examining cytochrome oxidase staining and proline radioautographs in another macaque that sustained severe eye injury by Hproline injection In striate cortex bands of radioactive label from the injured eye matched ocular dominance columns appearing more lightly stained by cytochrome oxidase In the macaque tested six months after enucleation in every other row the cytochrome oxidase patches appeared pale and shrunken These lighter rows fit into precise register with the lighter ocular dominance columns in layer IV c confirming the correspondence between rows of patches and ocular dominance columns demonstrated by proline injection AChE staining of patches was similarly affected by eye removal The effect of visual deprivation upon cytochrome oxidase staining was tested in two monocularly sutured macaques In the lgn no effect was detected In visual cortex wide light columns alternating with thin dark columns were observed in layer IV In one m acaque the ocular dominance columns were labelled independently by H R P injection into a deprived lgn lamina The H R P labelled ocular dominance columns fit within the pale cytochrome oxidase columns this establishes that monocular deprivation causes a relatively greater loss of enzyme activity in ocular dom inance columns belonging to the closed eye However there was also loss of cytochrome oxidase staining along the borders of the normal eye dominance columns indicating that ocular dominance columns in layer IV are subdivided into core zones flanked by border strips that are susceptible to loss of cytochrome oxidase activity with suture of either eye The core zones are the same width as the rows of cytochrome oxidase patches and correspond to the dark bands seen in Liesegang stains of normal macaque striate cortex In two adult cats the effect of monocular lid suture at  d old was assessed no effect upon cytochrome oxidase staining in lgn or cortex was observed The optic disc representation in visual cortex was studied by -deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining after eye removal or lid suture in m acaque monkeys It appeared as a pale oval  times longer than the optic disc a distortion probably required to m aintain overall isotrophy in magnification factor Patches were present in the disc representation although ocular dominance columns are absent they appeared rounder and more widely separated In the temporal cresent patches were also present They were larger rounder and less densely spaced than patches in binocular cortex Deoxyglucose mapping in a macaque monkey monocularly stimulated with a display of parallel black and white stripes of irregular width and spacing rotated through all orientations has resulted in patches in the upper layers over ocular dominance columns corresponding to the open eye These patches match cytochrome oxidase patches situated in every other row thus suggesting that cells located in cytochrome oxidase patches respond to all orientations of stimulus Macaques binocularly stimulated with vertical or horizontal stripes show a complicated pattern of deoxyglucose uptake overlapping extensively with the pattern of cytochrome oxidase patches In one monkey the right eye was removed and  d later the animal was stimulated with vertical stripes Deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining combined in single tissue sections each revealed a matching pattern of ocular dominance columns in layer IV In the upper layers dots of radioautographic label were present matching cytochrome oxidase patches in alternate rows In foetal monkeys at E- the laminar pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining in visual cortex was remarkable for a prominent wide band of intense activity in layer IV b and upper IV ca absent in mature macaques In tangential section patches were visible in layers II III and in layer IV b -IV ca which indicates that patches form in monkey visual cortex before birth The functional significance of the patches remains uncertain It has been suggested that the visual field is analysed in visual cortex by small modules containing several hypercolumns of each stimulus variable The cytochrome oxidase patches may constitute the anatomical correlate of these proposed modules

When using a stereotaxic instrument for visual field stimulation we found that electrode placements in the thalamus and mesencephalon of prone rhesus monkeys with the aid of avaiable atlases showed considerable errors As these animals are valuable for primate visual system reseach an atlas was constructed with methods that have not been used before for rhesus In addition the specific connections from the visual cortices superior colliculus and retina to the thalamus and mesencephalon are also shown Anesthetized monkeys of specific body dimensions had a matrix of pins inserted into the brain before fixation A matrix was used so that the penetrations seen in the sectioned brain could be cross related as a control for accurate measurements of the stereotaxic planes throughout the brain The surface of the whole brain frozen blocks were photographed on the microtome just before a cut section was taken These calibrated pictures formed the floor plan of the atlas as they represent more accurately the brain geometry than individual sections which are distorted by cutting staining and mounting Cytoarchitectural Nissl stain and axonal connectional Fink-Heimer stain information was transferred and adjusted onto the block pictures from their corresponding stained sections Follow up experiments showed that the present coordinates are accurate for these monkeys of restricted body dimensions In addition referencing visual axonal projections onto the same cytoarchitectural map in stereotaxic coordinates provides an atlas for localizing areas of the thalamus on a basis other than cytoarchitecture which receive combinations of visual inputs for further anatomical and physiological studies of the rhesus monkey visual system The atlas further demonstrates that projections do not necessarily follow the cytoarchitectural definition of an area but rather redefine the thalamus on the basis of specific axonal connections

Parallel enhancement of responses of spinothalamic tract neurons to mechanical stimulation and excitatory amino acids	Somatosensory neurons of the spinal cord including projection neurons become hyperexcitable to mechanical stimuli during the development of experimental arthritis in rats and cats and hence are suggested to participate in the generation of arthritic hyperalgesia in humans The experiments described here show a potentiation of the responses of spinothalamic tract STT neurons in monkeys during the development of an acute arthritis The results demonstrate that the responses of STT neurons to mechanical stimuli and to iontophoretically applied excitatory amino acids EAAs particularly those acting atnon-NMDA receptors become enhanced during the development of inflammation produced by intra-articular injection of kaolin and carrageenan Since the enhancement of both responses follows a similar time course the results of this work suggest a role for EAAs in the hyperalgesia associated with arthritis and hence may provide a possible pharmacologic target for alleviation andor prevention of arthritic pain	Primate; Hyperalgesia; Microiontophoresis; Glutamate; Aspartate; Dorsal horn; Spinal cord;

The pulvinar is the largest of the thalamic nuclei in the primates including humans In the primates two of the three major subdivisions the lateral and inferior pulvinar are heavily interconnected with a significant proportion of the visual association cortex However while we now have a better understanding of the bidirectional connectivity of these pulvinar subdivisions its functions remain somewhat of an enigma Over the past few years researchers have started to tackle this problem by addressing it from the angle of development and visual cortical lesions In this review we will draw together literature from the realms of studies in nonhuman primates and humans that have informed much of the current understanding This literature has been responsible for changing many long-held opinions on the development of the visual cortex and how the pulvinar interacts dynamically with cortices during early life to ensure rapid development and functional capacity Furthermore there is evidence to suggest involvement of the pulvinar following lesions of the primary visual cortex V and geniculostriate pathway in early life which have far better functional outcomes than identical lesions obtained in adulthood Shedding new light on the pulvinar and its role following lesions of the visual brain has implications for our understanding of visual brain disorders and the potential for recovery	visual system; development; thalamus; hemianopia; blindsight; infants; pulvinar

Anatomical observations	We studied the effects of early unilateral blur on the anatomical organization of the visual pathways in  macaque monkeys Blur was induced in one eye beginning  d after birth by  atropine twice a day Atropinization was stopped at  months of age and the animals were studied for anatomy  months later The retina and all other eye tissues showed normal histology In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus LGN cells in parvocellular layers receiving input from the atropine-treated eye were  smaller and were more lightly stained than those in layers innervated by the untreated eye These changes were generally larger in the LGN ipsilateral to the treated eye LGN cell size changes were absent or much smaller in the magnocellular layers In the striate cortex the distribution of the oxidative enzyme cytochrome oxidase CO was markedly altered in layer C beta Layer C beta is uniformly stained in normal animals but showed a distinct pattern of alternating high and low CO bands in the atropine-treated animals the bands of higher CO activity were narrower than the bands of lower activity and had a  micron repeat Fainter banding was seen in layers A C alpha and  but the density of the rows of dark CO-stained dots in layer  was unaffected Double- labeling revealed that the narrow dark CO bands were associated with the centers of the ocular dominance columns devoted to the atropine- treated eye The distribution of C--deoxyglucose uptake in visual cortex produced by  cdeg spatial frequency stimulation was strongly biased toward the untreated eye The treated eye could however elicit reasonably strong uptake when stimulated with patterns containing lower spatial frequencies These results suggest that unilateral neonatal blur preferentially affects the parvocellular layers of the LGN and layer C beta of striate cortex which are the portions of the central visual system associated with the processing of information concerning fine spatial detail These anatomical changes are consistent with the high spatial frequency loss of vision demonstrated behaviorally and electrophysiologically in the atropine eye-driven visual system of these same animals

I. Oculomotor Signals Sent From Superior Colliculus to Frontal Eye Field Via Mediodorsal Thalamus	Neuronal processing in cerebral cortex and signal transmission from cortex to brain stem have been studied extensively but little is known about the numerous feedback pathways that ascend from brain stem to cortex In this study we characterized the signals conveyed through an ascending pathway coursing from the superior colliculus SC to the frontal eye field FEF via mediodorsal thalamus MD Using antidromic and orthodromic stimulation we identified SC source neurons MD relay neurons and FEF recipient neurons of the pathway in Macaca mulatta The monkeys performed oculomotor tasks including delayed-saccade tasks that permitted analysis of signals such as visual activity delay activity and presaccadic activity We found that the SC sends all of these signals into the pathway with no output selectivity ie the signals leaving the SC resembled those found generally within the SC Visual activity arrived in FEF too late to contribute to short-latency visual responses there and delay activity was largely filtered out in MD Presaccadic activity however seemed critical because it traveled essentially unchanged from SC to FEF Signal transmission in the pathway was fast  ms from SC to FEF and topographically organized SC neurons drove MD and FEF neurons having similarly eccentric visual and movement fields Our analysis of identified neurons in one pathway from brain stem to frontal cortex thus demonstrates that multiple signals are sent from SC to FEF with presaccadic activity being prominent We hypothesize that a major signal conveyed by the pathway is corollary discharge information about the vector of impending saccades

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception; often by making the sound seem louder; the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review; we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g.; what circuits underlie multisensory convergence); and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g.; what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact; it seems that the question is no longer whether low level; putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences; but how. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many of the ascending pathways to the thalamus have branches involved in movement control In addition the recently defined rich innervation of higher thalamic nuclei such as the pulvinar from pyramidal cells in layer five of the neocortex also comes from branches of long descending axons that supply motor structures For many higher thalamic nuclei the clue to understanding the messages that are relayed to the cortex will depend on knowing the nature of these layer five motor outputs and on defining how messages from groups of functionally distinct output types are combined as inputs to higher cortical areas Current evidence indicates that many and possibly all thalamic relays to the neocortex are about instructions that cortical and subcortical neurons are contributing to movement control The perceptual functions of the cortex can thus be seen to represent abstractions from ongoing motor instructions

Segregation of functionally distinct optic axons	The fibre organization of the monkeys optic tract was examined by implanting pellets of horseradish peroxidase into different locations within the tract or into the superior colliculus and pretectum Retinae were examined for the distribution size and morphological types of retrogradely labelled ganglion cells optic tracts were examined for the distribution of anterogradely and retrogradely labelled axonal profiles and lateral geniculate nuclei were examined for the distribution of anterogradely labelled processes within distinct geniculate laminae Localized implants in the optic tract produced retrograde labelling of ganglion cells across wide regions of the retinal surface The maximum density of labelled cells was always substantially less than the total ganglion cell density known to be present at those retinal loci Distinct retinal ganglion cell types were labelled from differing regions within the optic tract implants into the deep dorsal portion of the tract far removed from the outer pial surface retrogradely labelled predominantly Pβ retinal ganglion cells whereas implants into the superficial ventral subpial part of the tract retrogradely labelled primarily the other retinal ganglion cell types ie the Pα Pγ and Pϵ cells Within any given class of axon there is a mapping of the centroperipheral retinal axis across the deep-to-superficial dimension of the tract but this retinotopy is extremely coarse Anterograde labelling of axonal terminations within the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a corresponding specificity for distinct geniculate laminae the deep implants labelling the parvocellular laminae superficial implants labelling the magnocellular laminae Implants into the visual centres of the midbrain produced retrograde axonal labelling rostral to the lateral geniculate nucleus only in the superficial part of the optic tract These results demonstrate that the monkeys optic tract is not a simple topographic mapping of retinal eccenticity Rather the primary organizational principle is that of a segregation of functionally distinct optic axon classes As fibre order in the mammalian optic tract is also a chronological index of axonal arrival during development the present results provide specific predictions about the temporal order of ganglion call genesis and axonal addition within the visual pathway They also provide an anatomical basis for the functionally selective visual impairments that may arise following local damage to the optic tract in humans

The cerebral cortex is divisible into a number of cytoarchitectonic areas but developmental mechanisms that regulate their number and size remain unknown Here we provide evidence that reducing the population of selected thalamic fibers projecting into the primary visual cortex area  of monkeys during midgestation induces the formation of a novel cytoarchitectonic area situated along the border of and embedded within area  This region termed area X differs cytoarchitectonically from both area  and the adjacent secondary visual cortex area  We propose that an aberrant combination of thalamic and cortical connections acting on a portion of prospective area  deprived of its normal thalamic input may result in formation of a hybrid cortex Our results support the protomap hypothesis of cortical parcellation and suggest how during evolution new cytoarchitectonic regions may arise by cell-cell interactions that depend on a unique combination of intrinsic properties of cortical neurons and afferent fibers

III. Effects of reversible inactivation by lidocaine on thermal and mechanical discrimination	The present study evaluates the necessity of the ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus VPM for discrimination of the intensity of noxious heating innocuous cooling and innocuous tactile airpuff stimulation of the maxillary skin  Two rhesus monkeys were trained to detect small differences   degrees C in the intensity of noxious heat near  degrees C and innocuous cold near  degrees C as well as differences in the force of an airpuff applied to the skin over the maxilla As a control the monkeys also detected small differences in the intensity of a white light Lidocaine hydrochloride  was microinjected into regions of thalamus where single-unit recordings had identified neuronal responses to the noxious heating andor cooling stimuli The effectiveness of the anesthetic blockade was monitored by multiunit recordings using microelectrodes positioned - mm from the orifice of the injection cannula The monkeys ability to detect near-threshold changes in stimulus intensity was compared before and after each injection  During six experimental sessions single injections of - microliters lidocaine near the dorsomedial border of VPM did not significantly alter the monkeys ability to detect small changes in the intensity of noxious heat cool airpuff or visual stimuli despite neurophysiological evidence that spontaneous neuronal activity was blocked within parts of VPM  During three experiments dual simultaneous microinjections of lidocaine delivered through  microcannulae separated by approximately  mm resulted in profound deficits in noxious heat discrimination with lesser deficits in cool and airpuff discrimination visual discrimination was never altered Monitoring of adjacent microelectrodes revealed that although activity ventral to the injection sites was blocked activity in medial thalamic nuclei implicated in nociceptive processing was probably not altered by these injections  These data suggest that VPM is important for the perception of noxious and innocuous thermal stimuli as well as for the perception of tactile stimuli However considering the ineffectiveness of small single microinjections of lidocaine it appears that some critical proportion of VPM must be inactivated to disrupt thermal or tactile discrimination possibly because of overlapping receptive field properties of neurons in different areas of the nucleus

Manual dexterity of great evolutionary significance to the primates ranges in complexity from the precise opposition of finger and thumb to Brendal playing Mozart All dexterity depends on a sustained and rapid transfer of sensorimotor information between the cerebral cortex and the cervical spinal cord  Multiple separate corticospinal neuron populations originate from cortical areas four the supplementary motor area anterior cingulate postarcuate parietal and insular cortex Each corticospinal neuron population projects in parallel to all spinal segments and has a distinctive pattern of terminations  Each corticospinal neuron population has a unique thalamic input which can relay particular sensorimotor information from the sense organs cerebellum and basal ganglia The overall structural framework of these sensorimotor pathways with many parallel corticospinal channels with interconnections in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord to enable crosstalk between the channels is that needed for parallel distributed processing which would enable the very rapid transfer of information between the cerebral cortex and spinal cord needed for any sophisticated use of the hand  Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord in the macaque results in an immediate hemiplegia with subsequent remarkable although incomplete recovery of hand and finger movements The only direct corticospinal input to the hemicord caudal to the hemisection even after  years is the   of fibres which cross the midline caudal to the lesion the fibres spared by the hemisection A matching sparing of somatosensory input from the paresed limb also occurs No regeneration of the interrupted pathways has been visualized using modern tracer techniques  Cervical hemisection permanently reduces the number of parallel channels which transmit information between cortex and spinal cord but does not reduce their cortical origins nor the neuron populations targeted in the spinal cord We infer that the content of the information that can be transmitted between the cortex and spinal cord is not greatly changed but the rate of transmission of this information is sharply reduced and is the bottleneck that limits the complete recovery of dexterity following hemisection The remarkable recovery that does occur presumably reflects more economic transmission of information by the few spared channels We guess that this involves substantial synaptic reorganization not visualized by the procedures we have used	cerebral cortex; corticospinal neurons; macaque monkey; parallel distributed processing; spinal hemisection; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; MOVEMENTS; REPRESENTATIONS; MAPS

II. Cerebellar projections compared with those of the ascending somatic sensory pathways in lateral diencephalon	Previous studies have shown that ascending somatic sensory pathways arising from the dorsal column nuclei lateral cervical nucleus and spinotha-lamic tract terminate in parts of the thalamus adjacent to those which receive cerebellar terminations This termination pattern creates a border between the ventroposterolateral nucleus VPL and the ventrolateral nucleus VL in the cat and between the caudal and oral parts of VPL VPLc and VPLo respectively in the monkey Since it is not clear how sharp these borders are a double orthograde labeling strategy was used in the present study to make direct comparisons of the projections to the thalamus from these sources of input It was found that there was a change in the sources of afferent input to the different target areas that paralleled changes in cytoarchitecture Moving caudally to rostrally VPL in the cat and VPLc in the monkey received projections predominantly from the middle dorsal clusters portion of the dorsal column nuclei These projections were gradually replaced near the VPL-VL border in the cat and VPLc-VPLo border in the monkey first by input from the lateral cervical nucleus cat only and the rostral and ventral portions of the dorsal column nuclei and then by spinothalamic projections Towards VL in the cat and the rostral parts of VPLo in the monkey referred to as Vim by Hassler  and Mehler  these projections were in turn replaced by those from the cerebellum This sequence resulted in a complex pattern summarized in Fig  where some thalamic territories received input predominantly trom one source and others received converging input from several sources The major region receiving converging ascending somatic sensory and cerebellar terminations was located at the border between VPL and VL in the cat and in the caudal parts of Olszewskis  VPLo in the monkey that is between VPLc and Vim In general the results in the cat were similar to those in the monkey One notable difference was that the domain containing terminals from the cerebellum and the rostral-ventral parts of the dorsal column nuclei was located medially between VPLc and Vim in the monkey whereas it extended across the entire mediolateral border between VPL and VL in the cat In both species thalamic neurons received input predominantly from one afferent source and only minor input if any from other sources This dominance of a single source of afferent input occurred even for neurons located in domains that received converging input from several sources When considered together with the results of others the results presented here indicate that the core and shells regions of VPL noted by a number of authors eg Bowsher  Andersson et al  Whitsel et al  Berkley  Friedman and Jones  Spreafico et al  cannot be sharply separated from each other or from more rostral regions by their pattern of afferent input their efferent output or their cytoarchitecture Such a situation permits flexibility in the processing of different types of somatic information and indicates that regions subserving different functions in the realms of somatic sensation and kinesthesia are only roughly separated from one another In addition in agreement with others the results suggest that in both species one possible function of the domain containing the converging cerebellar and ascending somatic sensory terminations involves the processing of somatic information related to the activation of receptors located in muscles joints tendons vestibular apparatus and other deep tissues

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years; rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models; a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models; cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover; some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models; a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans; the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus; ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments; they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore; we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys; the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter; a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection; the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models; the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP; in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore; the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months; such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently; brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore; the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.

The role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in the control of movements is unclear We summarize results from three groups of PET studies of regional CBF The results show a double dissociation between i selection of movements which induces differential effects in the basal ganglia but not the cerebellum and ii sensory information processing which involves the cerebellum but not the basal ganglia The first set of studies concerned motor learning of a sequence of finger movements there was a shift of activation in the anterior-posterior direction of the basal ganglia which paralleled changes in the motor areas of the frontal cortex During new learning the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum caudate nucleus and anterior putamen were activated When subjects had to select movements the premotor cortex and mid-putamen were activated With automatic overlearned movements the sensorimotor cortex and posterior putamen were activated When subjects paid attention to overlearned actions activation shifted back to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum The cerebellum was not activated when subjects made new decisions attended to their actions or selected movements These results demonstrate components of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops in humans According to earlier studies in animals we propose that the basal ganglia may be concerned with selecting movements or the selection of appropriate muscles to perform a movement selected by cortical areas eg premotor cortex Secondly a visuomotor co-ordination task was examined In the absence of visual control over arm movements subjects were required to use a computer mouse to either generate new lines or to re-trace lines on a computer screen The neocerebellum hemispheres of the posterior lobe cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar vermis not the basal ganglia was more engaged when lines were re-traced compared with new line generation Animal experiments have shown that error detection deviation from given lines and correction occurs during line re-tracing but not line generation Our data suggest that the neocerebellum not the basal ganglia is involved in monitoring and optimizing movements using sensory proprioceptive feedback Thirdly the relative contribution of sensory information processing to the signal during activepassive execution of a motor task flexion and extension of the elbow was examined it was found that - of the neocerebellar signal could be attributed to sensory information processing The basal ganglia were not involved in sensory information processing They may be concerned with movement muscle selection efferent motor component the neocerebellum may be concerned with monitoring the outcome afferent sensory component and optimizing movements using sensory feedback information	basal ganglia; cerebellum; movement control; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR CONTROL; PASSIVE MOVEMENTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPINAL PROJECTIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASIS PONTIS; PET IMAGES; ANATOMY

1630								10.3791/5133					Large-scale Reconstructions and Independent; Unbiased Clustering Based on Morphological Metrics to Classify Neurons in Selective Populations	This protocol outlines large-scale reconstructions of neurons combined with the use of independent and unbiased clustering analyses to create a comprehensive survey of the morphological characteristics observed among a selective neuronal population. Combination of these techniques constitutes a novel approach for the collection and analysis of neuroanatomical data. Together; these techniques enable large-scale; and therefore more comprehensive; sampling of selective neuronal populations and establish unbiased quantitative methods for describing morphologically unique neuronal classes within a population. The protocol outlines the use of modified rabies virus to selectively label neurons. G-deleted rabies virus acts like a retrograde tracer following stereotaxic injection into a target brain structure of interest and serves as a vehicle for the delivery and expression of EGFP in neurons. Large numbers of neurons are infected using this technique and express GFP throughout their dendrites; producing Golgi-like complete fills of individual neurons. Accordingly; the virus-mediated retrograde tracing method improves upon traditional dye-based retrograde tracing techniques by producing complete intracellular fills. Individual well-isolated neurons spanning all regions of the brain area under study are selected for reconstruction in order to obtain a representative sample of neurons. The protocol outlines procedures to reconstruct cell bodies and complete dendritic arborization patterns of labeled neurons spanning multiple tissue sections. Morphological data; including positions of each neuron within the brain structure; are extracted for further analysis. Standard programming functions were utilized to perform independent cluster analyses and cluster evaluations based on morphological metrics. To verify the utility of these analyses; statistical evaluation of a cluster analysis performed on 160 neurons reconstructed in the thalamic reticular nucleus of the thalamus (TRN) of the macaque monkey was made. Both the original cluster analysis and the statistical evaluations performed here indicate that TRN neurons are separated into three subpopulations; each with unique morphological characteristics.

I. Electrophysiology	In squirrel monkeys or macaques under barbiturate anesthesia one or a few electrical pulses applied to the mesencephalic reticular formation or pretectal area alters synaptic transmission through the lateral geniculate nucleus as tested by magnitude of response in optic radiation to stimulation of optic tract The effect begins within  msec after the start of the mesencephalic stimulation and is usually biphasic Initial inhibition lasts for about  msec and is then replaced by facilitation which peaks around  msec and may endure as much as  sec The major site of the effect is upon the lateral geniculate nucleus and both magno- and parvocellular elements are involved Only rarely does the mesencephalic stimulation directly alter excitability of striate cortex In this respect as well as in the strong facilitation of photically elicited responses the effects in primates differ significantly from those in cats Although the inhibition observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus meets criteria commonly believed to signify a presynaptic origin several paradoxical facts see Discussion must be resolved before this interpretation can be secure It is hypothesized that the observed effects arise primarily from intrusion into a system normally concerned with the acquisition of visual information by ocular saccades Saccadic gating of transmission through the lateral geniculate nucleus would distinguish self-generated visual signals from similar extrinsically initiated signals and would thus constitute the corollary discharge	Eye movements; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Mesencephalic reticular formation; Pretectal area; Visual system;

Previously we discovered that the broadband cells in the two magnocellular large cell layers of the monkey lateral geniculate nucleus LGN are much more sensitive to luminance contrast than are the color-sensitive cells in the four parvocellular small cell layers We now report that this large difference in contrast sensitivity is due not to LGN circuitry but to differences in sensitivity of the retinal ganglion cells that provide excitatory synaptic input to the LGN neurons This means that the parallel analysis of color and luminance in the visual scene begins in the retina probably at a retinal site distal to the ganglion cells

Three monkeys were trained to perform a reaction-time task of the wrist and single-cell recordings were made from the motor cortex eighty-four cells ventro-posterior lateralis par caudalis VPLc forty-two cells and cerebellar thalamus seventy-seven cells  The majority   of cerebellar thalamic neurones fired phasically during movement whereas in the motor cortex most neurones   had a phasic-tonic discharge pattern Most neurones in both locations discharged in relation to the direction of movement reciprocal pattern  The cerebellar thalamus is unlike the motor cortex in that it does not usually encode a signal for force or joint position in its discharge  Twenty-two per cent  of cerebellar thalamic neurones had a period of reduced discharge rate before the phasic burst of activity and represent a pattern of discharge not seen in motor cortex or VPLc neurones  The onset of phasic activity in the cerebellar thalamus was significantly later average  ms than in the motor cortex but occurred just before electromyogram EMG activity The phasic activity in the cerebellar thalamus usually ended before the phasic component of motor cortex discharge was completed  Phasic activity in VPLc neurones commenced after the onset of EMG discharge and on average  ms after the commencement of movement Most neurones with deep sensory receptive fields fired with a reciprocal pattern while neurones with cutaneous fields usually fixed bidirectionally in relation to the task Almost one-third of neurones signalled force and a similar number had discharge levels that encoded characteristics of the joint position  The duration of discharge of VPLc neurones during the voluntary movement was marginally less than the duration of the movement velocity peak and the VPLc may therefore be signalling the duration of the velocity Phasic activity in cerebellar thalamic neurones fired for a duration similar to the VPLc neurones but commenced before the movement Therefore if the cerebellar thalamus is carrying information about the duration of the velocity it does so before the movement starts  The phasic burst of activity in cells of the cerebellar thalamus is timed so that it can contribute to the later component of the phasic burst of motor cortical discharge Thus we speculate that in skilled ballistic movements the cerebellum may provide a response which travels via the cerebellar thalamus and helps to determine the magnitude and duration of the phasic part of cortical dischargeABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT  WORDS

This study examined the importance of the primate magnocellular retinocortical pathway in the perception of moving stimuli A portion of the magnocellular pathway was permanently and selectively interrupted by ibotenic acid injections in the LGN of macaque monkeys We then tested contrast sensitivity for detecting moving stimuli as well as two indices of motion perception contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination and speed difference thresholds in the affected portion of the visual field Magnocellular lesions greatly reduced detection contrast sensitivity at high temporal and low spatial frequencies and had a similar effect on contrast sensitivity for opposite direction discrimination under these same stimulus conditions Consequently opposite direction discriminations could be made at contrast threshold suggesting that magnocellular lesions reduced the visibility of stimuli used to test direction perception but did not act directly on direction perception Magnocellular lesions also elevated speed difference thresholds under some stimulus conditions However this deficit was reduced or eliminated by raising the contrast of the test stimulus Together these findings suggest that magnocellular lesions reduce the visibility of stimuli used to test motion perception but that they do not appear to alter motion perception otherwise

Lateral and medial thalamus are traditionally thought to have separate roles in pain processing with lateral lemniscal regions transmitting discriminative information about location and intensity while medial nonspecific regions are involved in emotional responses Contrary to this view the present study shows that some single neurons in medial thalamus of alert monkey discriminate changes in the intensity of noxious stimuli that are equal to or below the monkeys own discrimination threshold Since these neurons are also modulated by anesthesia and attentional factors we suggest that parts of medial thalamus may participate in both discriminative and affective dimensions of pain	Medial thalamus; Sensory-discriminative; Affective; Pain; Monkey;

In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast; saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands; or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain; although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge; for example on visual processing; has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus; in the brainstem; through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field; in the prefrontal cortex. First; the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second; they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third; eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth; eliminating the signals should; however; disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge; such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field; we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals; particularly in the realm of sensory perception; remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover; many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys; and some of these; too; may carry corollary discharge signals.

I. Ascending somatic sensory inputs to lateral diencephalon	Projections to the lateral diencephalon from the dorsal column nuclei DCN lateral cervical n LCN and spinal cord ST in cats and monkeys and from the spinal portion of the trigeminal n sTN in the cat were compared using a double-orthograde labeling strategy This strategy combines autoradiographic and degeneration tracing methods in the same animal and permits direct comparisons of the terminal labeling patterns of two different pathways in each experiment The results suggest that the major part of the lateral diencephalon which receives input from the somatic sensory pathways in both the cat and the monkey is arranged in a core-shell fashion The core consists of the group of nuclei which together constitute the ventrobasal complex VB The shell consists of a group of nuclei which together tend to surround VB nearly completely This group includes the posterior group PO the ventral posteroinferior n VPI and the border region between VB and the ventrolateral n VB-VL In addition to the core and shell regions two other regions in the lateral diencephalon receive input from the somatic sensory pathways These regions are the ventromedial part of the magnocellular portion of the medial geniculate n MGNm and caudomedial portion of the zona incerta ZI The cytoarchitectural and hodological patterns of the core region differ from those of the shell region In both the monkey and the cat the core region VB has a relatively homogeneous cytoarchitectural appearance and is filled by dense inputs from DCN LCN and sTN in the cat and from DCN LCN and ST and probably from sTN in the monkey Direct comparisons of the terminals of fibers from different pathways demonstrate that although there is some convergence on the same neurons within VB the major tendency is for each of the inputs to form its densest terminations on different neurons This partial segregation manifests itself in two ways First each pathway has its own preferred territory within VB where its terminations are the densest Second the terminal fields of the inputs usually have a clustered appearance which is characterized by dense patches of terminals separated by regions in which the terminations appear quite sparse The dense patches from different pathways do not occur in relation to the same groups of neurons In contrast most portions of the shell region have a lower cell density than that of the core and a heterogeneous cytoarchitectonic appearance which can often be described as transitional in character between its neighboring areas In both species different parts of the shell region receive sparse and scattered input from those pathways which project densely and precisely to areas immediately adjacent to that part of the shell Very few of the terminals of these different inputs appear to converge on the same groups of neurons The two otehr recipient targets of somatic senory input ie MGNm ZI each has its own characteristic connective pattern that differs from taht of either the core or the shell region The connective patterns in the cat and monkey are quite similar The mian differences are in the projections of parts of the ST ans LCN pathways The nature of these differences suggest taht it might be useful from a functional perspective to consider the LCN and ST pathways together as part of the same spinal system rather than as separate functional entities The LCN pathyway could then be viewed as having perhaps been dervied from different parts of a single population of diencephalic-projecting neurons in the spinal cord of the two species When these anatomical results are considered together with the available electrophysiological evidence it appears that the response properties and functions of some portions of the somatic senory regions within the diencephalon can be generally predicted from knowledge of the particular pathways whose axons terminate within these regions Such predictions can be made however only when the input pathways have markedly different functions eg vestibular auditory cutaneous At present more precise kinds of predicitions are precluded by the similarity that exists between the functional properties of many of the units in teh DCN sTN LCN and ST pathways and the luck of knowledge of the sorting processes which occur as fibers in each of these pathways diverge to terminate in different parts of the brain

Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH neurons represent the primary neuroendocrine link between the brain and the reproductive system Although they play a key role in stimulating the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland the underlying mechanism by which they trigger the onset of puberty is unclear To address this issue RT-PCR in situ hybridization histochemistry and Affymetrix gene arrays were used to profile hypothalamic GnRH gene expression in prepubertal and adult rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta Like humans these nonhuman primates express two molecular forms of GnRH GnRH-I and GnRH-II both of which are highly effective at stimulating gonadotropin release via the same GnRHR receptor However only GnRH-II shows increased hypothalamic expression in the presence of elevated estrogen concentrations ie positive feedback whereas GnRH-I expression either remains the same or decreases ie negative feedback In the present study the hypothalamic expression levels of GnRH-I and GnRHR were found to be no different between prepubertal and adult animals despite marked differences in circulating sex-steroid hormone levels whereas the hypothalamic expression level of GnRH-II was significantly higher in the adults than in the juveniles Therefore although the traditional GnRH-I neurons are likely to play a fundamental role in initiating FSH and LH release during the early stages of pubertal development GnRH-II neurons may play an important role in maintaining elevated gonadotropin release during the final stages ie at a time when the GnRH-I neurons are subjected to increasing negative sex-steroid feedback from the maturing gonads Taken together the data suggest that sexual maturation in primates is likely to be orchestrated by the concerted action of two distinct GnRH neuronal subtypes that respond differentially to sex-steroid feedback

Anatomical and physiological data obtained from investigations of area V of the macaque monkey visual cerebral cortex have been used in  models outlining possible circuitry underlying functional properties of the region The  models use respectively a fully implemented computer neural network a mathematical formulation of interactions in a descriptive model of anatomical circuitry and a purely descriptive account of circuitry that could underlie particular functions The st  models involve as part of their design an interpolation principle where afferents of opposite physiological property establish spatially offset but adjacent terminal fields and the postsynaptic neurons dendrites have a continuum of different degrees of overlap into the  afferent pools and therefore different synaptic weights from the  afferents this creates a functional and spatial gradient of response properties in the postsynaptic neurons between the properties of the different sets of afferents The rd model examines lateral excitatory and inhibitory interactions in such gradients Model  addresses the transformation of distinct thalamic axon properties to a gradient of response properties in postsynaptic spiny stellate neurons in layer C of V Model  proposes circuitry producing orientation specificity in V that begins by generating specificity of responses to orthogonal orientations this is achieved by means of orthogonally oriented lateral axon projections made by the layer C spiny stellate neurons this is followed by generation of a full cycle of orientation specificities by means of pyramidal neuron dendritic overlap across spatially separated fields of spiny stellate neuron axons responding preferentially to orthogonal orientations Model  describes a circuitry to explain inhibitory and facilitatory interactions observed to occur in single unit responses when the classical receptive field is stimulated concurrently with the surround region All the proposed models make predictions that can be tested by further anatomical and physiological experiments in the real visual cortex

Neurons of laminae 4C and 5A	A study has been made using Golgi preparations of the organization of neurons with smooth or sparsely spined dendrites here called local circuit neurons of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex Since these neurons include those responsible for inhibitory circuitry of the cortex a better understanding of their anatomical organization is essential to concepts of functional organization of the region This account describes those neurons found with cell body and major dendritic spread within the thalamic recipient zone of lamina C and its border zone with lamina A The neurons are grouped firstly in terms of in which laminar division the soma occurred CβbT CβaL or the border zone of A-CβbTand secondly into varieties on the basis of the interlaminar projection patterns of their axons Most if not all of the local circuit neurons of these divisions have interlaminar axon projections as well as an arbor local to their cell body and dendritic field These interlaminar projections are highly specific targeting from one to five laminar divisions depending on the variety of neuron on this basis  varieties of local circuit neuron are described While the number of varieties appears dauntingly large in terms of understanding the functional circuitry of the region the clear-cut organization of the interlaminar links may provide clues as to the information processing that concerns each neuron The local circuit neuron axon projections can be related to a wealth of information already available concerning the laminar organization of afferent axons and efferent cell groups the organization of spiny neuron intrinsic relays presumed to be excitatory and physiological properties of different laminar divisions It is hoped that the information derived from this study can serve as a guide for correlated physiological-anatomical studies on single cells of the region
