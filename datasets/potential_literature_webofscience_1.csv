It is not known, however, whether contralateral thalamocortical projections reach particular cortices or whether they emanate from specific nuclei. In the rhesus monkey different types of cortices, ranging from transitional to eulaminate, vary in their cortical connectional pattern and may also differ in their thalamic connections. Because olfactory and transitional prefrontal cortices receive widespread projections, we investigated whether they are the target of projections from the contralateral thalamus as well. With the aid of retrograde tracers, we studied the thalamic projections of primary olfactory (olfactory tubercle and prepiriform cortex) and transitional orbital (areas PAll, Pro, 13) and medial (areas 25, 24, 32) areas, and of eulaminate (areas 11, 12, 9) cortices for comparison. To determine the prevalence of neurons in the contralateral thalamus, we compared them with the ipsilateral in each case. The pattern of ipsilateral thalamic projections differed somewhat among orbital, medial, and olfactory cortices. The mediodorsal nucleus was the predominant source of projections to orbital areas, midline nuclei included consistently about 25% of the thalamic neurons directed to medial transitional cortices, and primary olfactory areas were distinguished by receiving thalamic projections predominantly from neurons in midline and intralaminar nuclei. Notwithstanding some broad differences in the ipsilateral thalamofrontal projections, which appeared to depend on cortical location, the pattern of contralateral projections was consistent with cortical type rather than location. Labeled neurons in the contralateral thalamus were noted in midline, the magnocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the anterior medial and intralaminar nuclei, and ranged from 0 to 14% of the ipsilateral; they were directed primarily to olfactory and transitional orbital and medial cortices but rarely projected to eulaminate areas. Several thalamic nuclei projected from both sides to olfactory and transitional areas, but issued only ipsilateral projections to eulaminate areas. Though ipsilateral thalamocortical projections predominate in adult mammalian species, crossed projections are a common feature in development. The results suggest differences in the persistence of contralateral thalamocortical interactions between transitional and eulaminate cortices.

Thalamic sections from 15 macaque monkeys were processed for visualization of calbindin (CB), parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (ir). PV-, CR- and SMI-32ir distributions did not show any clear correlation with known functional subdivisions. In contrast, CBir distribution reliably defined two markedly distinct motor thalamic territories, one characterized by high cell and neuropil CBir (CB-positive territory), the other by very low cell and neuropil CBir (CB-negative territory). These two neurochemically distinct compartments, the CB-negative and the CB-positive territories, appear to correspond to the cerebellar- and basal ganglia-recipient territories, respectively. To verify the possible correspondence of the CB-negative territory with the cerebellar-recipient sector of the motor thalamus, we compared the distribution of cerebello-thalamic projections with the distribution of CBir in two monkeys. The distribution of cerebellar afferent terminals was similar to that reported from previous reports and in line with the notion that in the motor thalamus the cerebellar-recipient territory does not respect cytoarchitectonic boundaries. Comparison with CB immunoarchitecture showed very close correspondence in the motor thalamus between the distribution of the anterograde labeling and the CB-negative territory, suggesting that the CB-negative territory represents the architectonic counterpart of the cerebellar-recipient territory. CB immunostaining may therefore represent a helpful tool for describing the association between thalamocortical projections and the basal ganglia or the cerebellar loops and for establishing possible homologies between the motor thalamus of non-human primates and humans.;"Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, I-43100 Parma, Italy; Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Fisiol, I-95125 Catania, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Catania";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Zappalà, Agata/GMX-5010-2022; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019";"Zappalà, Agata/0000-0002-0213-776X; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618";;;;;45;19;19;0;3;WILEY-BLACKWELL;MALDEN;COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.

Whilst binding sites were evident throughout the thalamus, the internuclear differences in the B(max) were up to 10-fold. In the basal ganglia the binding density was on average lower than in the thalamus. The highest number of binding sites was in striatum followed closely by substantia nigra. In both the thalamus and basal ganglia, the binding density was higher than previously described in the rat. Although our results do not allow us to differentiate between presynaptic and postsynaptic locations of GABA(B) sites we conclude that with a few exceptions the distribution pattern of GABA(B) binding sites in the monkey thalamus appears to correlate with the known innervation from the NRT.

Until recently, however, longitudinal characterization of in vivo thalamus dynamics had not been reported. In this study, we investigated the metabolism in the thalamus to identify the changes that occur following Coriaria lactone (CL)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and to observe whether the epileptiform discharges could present a difference between the left and right thalami. Five rhesus monkeys underwent whole-brain MRI and single-voxel MRS on a Siemens Trio Tim 3-T MR scanner with a 12-channel head coil. Spectra were processed using LCModel. Scans were performed in five animals before SE and at 1, 7, 21 and 42?days after the onset of SE. Statistical analysis of the data obtained demonstrated no significant difference in the bilateral thalamus of healthy macaques. Our MRS data showed symmetrical distributions of N-acetylaspartate in the right and left thalami after SE (p?=?0.003). In addition, this longitudinal study demonstrated elevated glutamate/glutamine (p?<?0.05) and reduced myo-inositol (p?<?0.05) in the bilateral thalamus 1?day after SE, and all metabolites approached their baseline levels by the fifth scan. Our results demonstrate that metabolic changes occur in the thalamus during CL-induced SE in rhesus monkeys. The various metabolic changes may indicate that the left thalamus is more vulnerable to epileptic strike.

In order to define the projections of the particular areas, injections of fluorescent tracers were made in three monkeys. Distribution of labeling indicates that area AA1 differs from areas AA2 and AA3 in patterns of both thalamo-cortical and amygdalo-cortical connections. Area AA1 receives its predominant inputs from the ventral and dorsal nuclei of the medial geniculate body (MGB). The amygdaloid projection to the area AA1 originates from the basal nuclei, whereas input from the lateral nucleus was not found. The characteristic thalamic projections to areas AA2 and AA3 originate from the dorsal MGB nucleus and the polymodal nuclei of the posterior thalamus. The density of projections from the dorsal nucleus gradually decreases from area AA1 to area AA3 while projections from the Plm, SE and Lim nuclei increase in the same direction. Areas AA2 and AA3 are the source of strong connections with the lateral nucleus of amygdala, which density increases progressively when injections shift from area AA2 to AA3. The basal and accessory basal nuclei are the source of a less significant amygdalofugal projections to both cortical areas. Thus, our experimental data indicate that influence of the polymodal thalamic nuclei increases substantially in the direction of the higher order association areas. The strong relation of the same cortical areas with the lateral amygdaloid nucleus might suggest that areas AA2 and AA3, in addition to auditory input are the site of transfer of complex sensory information to the amygdala.;;;Kosmal, A (corresponding author), M NENCKI INST EXPT BIOL,DEPT NEUROPHYSIOL,3 PASTEUR ST,PL-02093 WARSAW,POLAND.;;;Malinowska, Monika/0000-0002-9031-6716;;;;;56;25;27;0;1;NENCKI INST EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY;WARSAW;UL PASTEURA 3, 02-093 WARSAW, POLAND;0065-1400;;;ACTA NEUROBIOL EXP;Acta Neurobiol.

The aim of the present study is the characterization of thalamic afferents of these two areas. For this purpose, retrograde neuronal tracers were injected, or placed in crystal form, in areas PEc and PE. We found that the two areas show a similar pattern of thalamic inputs, mainly originating from Lateral Posterior (LP), Pulvinar (Pul), Ventral Posterior Lateral (VPL), and Ventral Lateral (VL) nuclei, all structures known to be involved in visual, somatosensory, and/or sensorimotor processing. Minor afferents were observed from the Centromedian/Parafascicular complex (CM/PF), Central Lateral (CL), Ventral Anterior (VA), and Medial Dorsal (MD) nuclei. LP and VL were more strongly connected to PEc than to PE, while the other main thalamic inputs to the two areas showed slight differences in strength. The part of the Pul mostly connected with areas PEc and PE was the Medial Pul. No labeled cells were found in the retinotopically organized Lateral and Inferior Pul. In the somatotopically organized VPL and VL nuclei, labeled neurons were mainly found in regions likely to correspond to the trunk and limb representations (in particular the legs). These findings are in line with the sensory-motor nature of areas PEc and PE, and with their putative functional roles, being them suggested to be involved in the preparation and control of limb interaction with the environment, and in locomotion.;"[Impieri, Daniele; Gamberini, Michela; Passarelli, Lauretta; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Gamberini, Michela; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Rosa, Marcello G.

As differences in cellular and synaptic thalamic organization would be expected to influence neuronal dendritic architecture, we compared somatosensory thalamocortical projection (TCP) neurons from the rat, cat and macaque. The results show that key features of the dendritic branching pattern remain unchanged despite large differences in the size of TCP neurons between the species. The features examined were: (i) ratio of the length of terminal branches to the length of the entire dendritic tree; (ii) the percentage of branch points that gave rise to two daughter branches as opposed to those that gave rise to three or more daughter branches; (iii) the proportional sum of absolute deviations (a measure of branching symmetry), and (iv) the mean branch order of the terminal segments. The present study provides evidence that somatosensory TCP neurons in these species comprise a homogeneous class and share a common dendritic architecture that is conserved across species despite changes in other aspects of thalamic circuitry. This suggests that TCP neuronal form is based on relatively stable genetic blueprint and that epigenetic factors (e.g. synaptic input) resulting from evolutionary changes in thalamic organization have had less influence on dendritic architecture.";"UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, WM KECK FDN, CTR INTEGRAT NEUROSCI, SAN FRANCISCO, CA USA; STANFORD UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT NEUROL & NEUROL SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Stanford University";OHARA, PT (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, DEPT ANAT, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA.;;;;"NIDCR NIH HHS [DE08973] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS26488, NS23347] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;32;6;6;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;1872-6240;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;JUN 20;1994;648;2;;;;;259;264;;10.1016/0006-8993(94)91125-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91125-8;;;6;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;NU173;7922539;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994NU17300009;View Full Record in Web of Science

(1990). HRP was injected into various regions of the cortex in different animals and hemispheres (see Fig. 1), and plots were made of the retrogradely stained thalamic projection neurons. The thalamocortical projection is virtually identical in both rodent species. It is topological throughout in that nearby cortical injections label nearby, though overlapping cell groups in the thalamus. Cortical injections in a rostro-caudal progression labelled thalamic projection zones on top of each other, layered like tiles on a roof or fish scales, beginning in the rostromedial and ending in the caudo-dorsal thalamus. The progression vector of thalamic zones projecting successively from more rostral to more caudal cortical zones is twisted and turns from a predominantly mediolateral direction in the anterior thalamus to an essentially ventro-dorsal direction in the posterior thalamus (Figs. 8 and 9). In the marmoset, the thalamo-cortical topography follows the same topological rule, with the exception of the lateral geniculate body which is translocated latero-ventrally and separated from the rest of the thalamus as in all primates. This suggests a general thalamo-cortical mapping rule common to all mammals which can be related to gradients and timing of cell birth in the thalamus. It is proposed that this mapping rule is the consequence of successive appositions of neurons in the medio-ventral thalamus during ontogenetic development.;"MAX PLANCK INST BIOPHYS CHEM,DEPT NEUROBIOL,POB 2841,W-3400 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY; UNIV BRASILIA,DEPT CIENCIAS FISIOL,NEUROBIOL LAB,BR-70910 BRASILIA,DF,BRAZIL";"Max Planck Society; Universidade de Brasilia";;;;;;;;;48;29;29;0;3;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Return frontal pathways to the thalamus originate from cortical layers 6 and 5. Information through this integrated thalamo-cortical system is gated by the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus and modulated by dopamine, representing a specialization in primates. The intricate dialogue of distinct thalamic nuclei with the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and specific dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortices associated with language, suggests synergistic roles in the complex but seemingly effortless sequential transformation of cognitive operations for speech production in humans.

Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and different parts of the prefrontal cortex are essential in cognitive processes, such as learning and adaptive decision-making. Cortico-thalamocortical interactions involving other dorsal thalamic nuclei, including the anterior thalamus and pulvinar, also influence these cognitive processes. Our work, and that of others, indicates a crucial influence of these interdependent cortico-thalamocortical neural networks that contributes actively to the processing of information within the cortex. Each of these thalamic nuclei also receives potent subcortical inputs that are likely to provide additional influences on their regulation of cortical activity. Here, we highlight our current neuroscientific research aimed at establishing when cortico-MD thalamocortical neural network communication is vital within the context of a rapid learning and memory discrimination task. We are collecting evidence of MD-prefrontal cortex neural network communication in awake, behaving male rhesus macaques. Given the prevailing evidence, further studies are needed to identify both broad and specific mechanisms that govern how the MD, anterior thalamus and pulvinar cortico-thalamocortical interactions support learning, memory and decision-making. Current evidence shows that the MD (and the anterior thalamus) are crucial for frontotemporal communication, and the pulvinar is crucial for frontoparietal communication. Such work is crucial to advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical and physiological bases of these brain functions in humans. In turn, this might offer avenues to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the cognitive deficits often observed in many debilitating neurological disorders and diseases and in neurodegeneration.;"[Perry, Brook A.

The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation. The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions. Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere-the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated. There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion. This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere. The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric nystagmus or perceived body motion. Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways.

AChE histochemistry is very useful in delineating the thalamic nuclei connected with the association cortex and in uncovering thalamic subdivisions that are barely evident on cytoarchitectonic grounds. Moreover, AChE activity reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneities within several thalamic nuclei, like the ventral anterior (VA), where a new ventromedial subdivision (VAvm) is described, the medial pulvinar (PulM) or the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In this nucleus three distinct chemical domains are present: the medial, ventral and lateral sectors characterized by low, moderate and high AChE activities, respectively. The staining pattern of the lateral sector is markedly heterogeneous with patches of intense AChE activity surrounded by a moderately stained matrix. The MD medial sector is connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the AChE-rich patches in the lateral sector are selectively connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal association cortices. In the PulM, a dorsomedial AChE-rich patch is selectively connected with the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the surrounding territory, which shows moderate AChE activity, is preferentially connected with the parietal and temporal cortices. Chemically specific domains in the anterior, ventral anterior, midline, and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are also connected with the examined association cortices. These findings indicate that the topographic patterns of the thalamo-cortical connections of primate association areas conform to the chemical architecture of the thalamus. This implies that because each cortical area is connected to a particular set of thalamic regions, the influence of the thalamus on cortical function is exclusive for each area, highly diverse among the various association areas, and subject to a wide range of modulation at the thalamic level.;;;CAVADA, C (corresponding author), UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,FAC MED,DEPT MORPHOL,ARZOBISPO MORCILLO S-N,E-28029 MADRID,SPAIN.;;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388";;;;;43;39;39;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0891-0618;;;J CHEM NEUROANAT;J.

Precuneate areas shared strong input from the posterior thalamus (lateral posterior nucleus and pulvinar complex) and moderate input from the medial, lateral, and intralaminar thalamic regions. Area PGm received strong connections from the subdivisions of the pulvinar linked to association and visual function (the medial and lateral nuclei), whereas areas 31 and PEci received afferents from the oral division of the pulvinar. All three cytoarchitectural areas also received input from subdivisions of the lateral thalamus linked to motor function (ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei), with area PEci receiving additional input from a subdivision linked to somatosensory function (ventral posterior lateral nucleus). Finally, only PGm received substantial limbic association afferents, mainly via the lateral dorsal nucleus. These results indicate that area PGm integrates information from visual association, motor and limbic regions of the thalamus, in line with a hypothesized role in spatial cognition, including navigation.

Our goal was to determine the proportion of labeled neurons contributing to this projection system by the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei, and to investigate the relationship of thalamic projections to specific architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex. We selected areas for study within both the basoventral (areas 11, 12, and ventral 46) and the mediodorsal (areas 32, 14, 46, and 8) prefrontal sectors. This choice was based on our previous studies, which indicate differences in cortical projections to these two distinct architectonic sectors (Barbas, '88; Barbas and Pandya, '89). In addition, for each sector we included areas with different architectonic profiles, which is also relevant to the connectional patterns of the prefrontal cortices. The results showed that MD included a clear majority (over 80%) of all thalamic neurons directed to some prefrontal cortices (areas 11, 46, and 8); it contributed just over half to some others (areas 12 and 32), and less than a third to area 14. Clusters of neurons directed to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal areas were largely segregated within MD: the former were found ventrally, the latter dorsally. However, the most striking findings establish a relationship between thalamic origin and laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. Most thalamic neurons directed to lateral prefrontal cortices, which are characterized by a high degree of laminar definition (areas 46 and 8), originated in the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions of MD, and only a few were found in other nuclei. In contrast, orbital and medial cortices, which have a low degree of laminar differentiation, were targeted by the magnocellular subdivision of MD and by numerous other limbic thalamic nuclei, including the midline and the anterior. Thus topographic specificity in the origin of thalamic projections increased as the laminar definition of the target area increased. Moreover, the rostrocaudal distribution of labeled neurons in MD and the medial pulvinar also differed depending on the degree of the laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. The rostral parts of MD and the medial pulvinar projected to the eulaminate lateral prefrontal cortices, whereas their caudal parts projected to orbital and medial limbic cortices. Selective destruction of caudal MD is known to disrupt mnemonic processes in both humans and monkeys, suggesting that this thalamic-limbic prefrontal loop may constitute an important pathway for memory.";BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA;Boston University;BARBAS, H (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV, DEPT HLTH SCI, 635 COMMONWEALTH AVE 431, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.;;;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;NINDS NIH HHS [NS24760] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;72;224;227;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

First published August 19, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91287.2008. A few studies have been performed in primate basal ganglia-thalamo-prefrontal pathways. Nevertheless, their electrophysiological properties and anatomical arrangements remain obscure. This study examined them in nigro-thalamo-cortical pathways from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the frontal cortex (FRC) via the mediodorsal (MD) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus in monkeys. First, single thalamocortical neurons with SNr input were identified by antidromic responses to FRC stimulation and by inhibitory orthodromic responses with short latencies (<5 ms) to SNr stimulation. Second, single nigrothalamic neurons were found by antidromic responses to stimulation of the portions of the MD and VA where the thalamocortical neurons were recorded. The inhibitory orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons were considered to be monosynaptically induced by nigral stimulation because the latency distribution of the orthodromic responses in the thalamocortical neurons was similar to that of the antidromic responses in the nigrothalamic neurons. Almost all relay neurons in the rostrolateral MD received inhibitory afferents from the caudolateral SNr and projected to the prefrontal area ventral to the principal sulcus, which constituted the densest nigro-thalamo-cortical projections. Meanwhile, neurons in the VA received inhibitory signals from the whole rostrocaudal extent of the SNr and projected to wide regions of the FRC; neurons in its pars magnocellularis mostly projected to different prefrontal areas, while those in its pars parvocellularis projected to motor areas. This report substantiated the topography of thalamocortical neurons monosynaptically receiving inhibitory SNr input and projecting to the FRC in the primate MD and VA at the single-neuron level.";"[Tanibuchi, Ikuo; Kitano, Hiroyuki; Jinnai, Kohnosuke] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Kitano, Hiroyuki] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan";"Shiga University of Medical Science; Shiga University of Medical Science";Tanibuchi, I (corresponding author), Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan.;buchi@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp;;;;;;;42;25;25;0;6;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

They are highly expressed in brain and are believed to play an integral role in neural cellular responses to receptor activation. A role for ERKs has been postulated in Alzheimer's disease, where they have been implicated in phosphorylation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles. We explored the neuroanatomic distribution of ERK immunoreactivity in the rhesus monkey brain. The hippocampal formation, especially the messy fiber zone and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are the most heavily immunostained areas. Cerebral cortex is, in general, more intensely stained in the supragranular layers. The caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra contain more immunoreactivity than the claustrum, globus pallidus, or thalamus with the exception of midline thalamic structures.

For this purpose, the left motorcortex was exposed in three animals under narcosis. By electrical brain stimulation, sites were identified yielding vocal fold adduction. Effective sites were injected with the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine. Subcortical projections could be traced within the forebrain to the putamen, caudate nucleus, claustrum, zona incerta, field H of Forel and a number of thalamic nuclei, with the heaviest projections to the nuclei ventralis lateralis, ventralis posteromedialis, including its parvocellular part, medialis dorsalis, centralis medialis, centrum medianum and reuniens. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep mesencephalic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, fibers terminated in the pontine and medullary reticular formation, locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract nucleus and facial nucleus. No projections were found to the nucl. ambiguus. The fact that monkeys, in contrast to humans, lack a direct connection of the motorcortex with the laryngeal motoneurons suggests that this connection has evolved in the last few million years and might represent one of the factors that made speech evolution possible.

Further, consistent evidence in animal models shows the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) contributes to adaptive decision-making. It is assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial temporal lobes govern these cognitive processes so this evidence suggests that MD contributes a role in these cognitive processes too. Anatomically, the MD has extensive excitatory cortico-thalamo-cortical connections, especially with the PFC. MD also receives modulatory inputs from forebrain, midbrain and brainstem regions. It is suggested that the MD is a higher order thalamic relay of the PFC due to the dual cortico-thalamic inputs from layer V ('driver' inputs capable of transmitting a message) and layer VI ('modulator' inputs) of the PFC. Thus, the MD thalamic relay may support the transfer of information across the PFC via this indirect thalamic route. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the anatomy of MD as a higher order thalamic relay. It also reviews behavioral and electrophysio-logical studies in animals to consider how MD might support the transfer of information across the cortex during learning and decision-making. Current evidence suggests the MD is particularly important during rapid trial-by-trial associative learning and decision-making paradigms that involve multiple cognitive processes. Further studies need to consider the influence of the MD higher order relay to advance our knowledge about how the cortex processes higher order cognition. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Retrograde tracing studies revealed that whisker-related VL neurons were found relatively anterior and medial to those labeled following injection of retrograde tracer into hindpaw motor areas. Simultaneous injections of fluorescent microspheres in both cortical regions did not result in double-labeled neurons in VL. Quantitative analysis of dendritic and somatic morphologies did not reveal any differences between hindpaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons within VL.

The known connections of areas 4 and 3b differ substantially, as does the information which they receive, process, and transfer to other parts of the central nervous system. In this analysis the thalamic projections to each of these three cortical fields were examined and compared by using retrogradely transported fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, Rhodamine and Green latex microspheres) as neuron labels. Coincident labeling of projections to 2-3 cortical sites in each monkey allowed the direct comparison of the soma distributions within the thalamic space of the different neuron populations projecting to areas 3a, 3b, and 4, as well as to boundary zones between these cortical fields. The soma distribution of thalamic neurons projecting to a small circumscribed zone (diameter = 0.5-1.0 mm) strictly within cortical area 3a (in region of hand representation) filled out a ''territory'' traversing the dorsal half of the cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus, VPLc (abbreviations as in Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. Basel: Karger). This elongate, rather cylindrical, territory extended caudally into the anterior pulvinar nucleus, but not forward into VPLo. The rostrocaudal extent of the thalamic territory defining the soma distribution of neurons projecting to small zones of cortical area 3b was similar, but typically extended into the ventral part of VPLc, filling out a medially concavo-convex laminar space. Two such territories projecting to adjacent zones of areas 3a and 3b, respectively, overlapped and shared thalamic space, but not thalamic neurons. Contrasting with the 3a and 3b thalamic territories, the soma distribution of thalamic neurons projecting to a circumscribed zone in the nearby motor cortex (area 4) did not penetrate into VPLc, but instead filled out a mediolaterally flattened territory extending from rostral VLo, VLm, VPLo to caudal and dorsal VLc, LP, and Pul.o. These territories skirted around VPLc. All three cortical areas 4, 3a, and 3b) also received input from distinctive clusters of cells in the intralaminar Cn.Md. It is inferred that, in combination, the thalamic territories enveloping those neuron somas projecting to, say, the sensorimotor hand representation in areas 3a, 3b, and 4 (and also areas 1 and 2), which would be coactive during the execution of a manual task, constituted a lamellar space extending from VLo rostrally to Pul.o caudally. How Pul.o neuron populations relate to the more rostral populations within the same thalamic territory projecting to a localized cortical zone remains uncertain. Within the medially located territories the distribution of the neuron population in Pul.o was spatially continuous with the more rostral thalamic cells projecting to the same localized cortex, but in lateral thalamic territories these 2 populations were usually spatially discontinuous. In the newborn macaque an orderly change in the territorial projections to localized zones in areas 4, 3a, and 3b was also demonstable. However, thalamic nuclear projections were more expansive than in the mature animal. As well as the VPLc input, a third of the thalamic input to area 3a was now from VLo, VPLo, and VLm. Area 4 also had a significant input from VPLc, an input not observed in the mature macaque.

Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay, and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain, detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information. To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control. Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation. The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia.

To determine the degree of divergence/convergence of thalamocortical projections to mesial [supplementary motor area (SMA)-proper and pre-SMA] and lateral (PMd-c, PMd-r, PMv-c and PMv-r) premotor (PM) subareas, quantitative analyses were performed on the distribution of retrograde labelling after multiple tracer injections in the same animal. The results demonstrate that all PM and SMA subareas receive common inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the relative contribution of these nuclei to thalamocortical projections differs. The largest difference occurs between subareas of SMA, with much greater contribution from the mediodorsal (MD) and area X, and a smaller contribution from the ventral lateral anterior (VLa) and ventral part of the ventral lateral posterior (VLpv) to pre-SMA than to SMA-proper. In PM, differences between subareas are less pronounced; in particular, all receive a significant contribution from MD, the ventral anterior (VApc) and area X. However, there are clear gradients, such as increasing projections from MD to rostral, from VLa and VLpv to caudal, and from dorsal VLp (VLpd) to dorsal premotor subareas. Intralaminar nuclei provide widespread projections to all premotor subareas. The degree of overlap between thalamocortical projections varies among different PM and SMA subareas and different sectors of the thalamus. These variations, which correspond to different origin and topography of thalamocortical projections, are discussed in relation to functional organizations at thalamic and cortical levels.";"Univ Zurich Hosp, Lab Funct Neurosurg, Neurosurg Clin, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Fribourg, Dept Med, Unit Physiol, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; Univ Fribourg, Program Neurosci, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland";"University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Fribourg; University of Fribourg";Morel, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich Hosp, Lab Funct Neurosurg, Neurosurg Clin, Sternwartstr 6, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland.;anne.morel@usz.ch;;Rouiller, Eric/0000-0003-1355-6019;;;;;107;57;58;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

To not rely an the rough definition of cytoarchitectonic boundaries in the thalamus, monkeys were subjected to multiple injections of tracers (four to seven) in the primary (M1), premotor (PM), and supplementary (SMA) motor cortical areas and in area 46. The cortical areas were distributed into five groups, each receiving inputs from a specific set of thalamic nuclei: 1) M1; 2) SMA-proper and the caudal part of the dorsal PM (PMdc); 3) the rostral and caudal parts of the ventral PM (PMvr and PMvc); 4) the rostral part of the dorsal PM (PMdr); and 5) the superior and inferior parts of area 46 (area 46sup and area 46inf). A major degree of overlap was obtained for the origins of the thalamocortical projections directed to areas 46inf and 46sup and for those terminating in SMA-proper and PMdc. PMvc and PMvr received inputs from adjacent and/or common thalamic regions. In contrast, the degree of overlap between M1 and SMA was smaller. The projection to M1 shared relatively limited zones of origin with the projections directed to PM. Thalamic inputs to the motor cortical areas (M1, SMA, PMd, and PMv), in general, were segregated from those directed to area 46, except in the mediodorsal nucleus, in which there was clear overlap of the territories sending projections to area 46, SMA-proper, and PMdc.

All neurons were located in the ventrobasal complex and responded to non-noxious stimuli. Each neuron was composed of dendrites that Varied considerably in size and each dendrite tended to occupy a particular region of the perisomatic space with minimal overlap with other dendrites. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dendritic arbors of the labeled neurons showed they had an asymmetric distribution so that some regions of the perisomatic space contained more of the dendritic tree than others. Eleven of the thirteen reconstructed neurons had a larger percentage of the dendritic tree projecting into the medial portion of the perisomatic space. These results show that the dendritic arbors of macaque TCP neurons are not organized in a radially symmetric pattern as previously described and the asymmetric distribution of dendrites may be related to synaptic input.;"UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, DEPT ANAT, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA; STANFORD UNIV, DEPT NEUROL & NEUROL SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA; UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, WM KECK FDN CTR INTEGRAT NEUROSCI, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Stanford University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco";;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS23347, NS07067, NS26488] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;27;7;7;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;1872-6240;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;FEB 28;1994;638;1-2;;;;;126;132;;10.1016/0006-8993(94)90641-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)90641-6;;;7;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;MZ355;8199853;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994MZ35500016;View Full Record in Web of Science

ML and STT axons were labeled by the anterograde axon transport of WGA-HRP following injection of the tracer into the contralateral dorsal column nuclei, or the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, respectively. Thalamic tissue was histochemically reacted for the presence of HRP. Serial thin sections were stained with a gold-labeled antibody to GABA, to determine which neuronal elements exhibited GABA immunoreactivity (GABA-ir). Serially sectioned thalamic structures were recorded in electron micrographs and reconstructed in three dimensions by computer. Individual ML axon terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with segments of the proximal dendritic trees of thalamocortical relay neurons and also synapse upon the dendritic appendages of GABA-ir interneurons (local circuit neurons). These GABA-ir dendritic appendages contain synaptic vesicles and are presynaptic (presynaptic dendrites) to the same segments of relay neuron dendrites that receive ML contacts. When analyzed in serial sections and reconstructed by computer, the ML terminals form triadic relationships (ML, GABA appendage, and relay neuron dendrite) or more complex glomerular arrangements involving multiple appendages, all of which then contact the relay neuron dendritic segment. In contrast, multiple STT terminals make synaptic contacts along segments of projection neuron dendrites and are usually the only type of profile to contact that segment of dendrite. More than 85% of the spinal afferents form simple axodendritic synapses with relay cells and do not contact GABA-ir appendages. The thalamic synaptic relationships of ML terminals are fundamentally different from those formed by the STT. Because STT neurons predominately transmit information about noxious stimuli, the simple axodendritic circuitry of the majority of these spinal afferents suggests that the transmission of noxious information is probably not subject to GABAergic modulation by thalamic interneurons, in contrast to the GABAergic processing of non-noxious information carried by the ML afferents. The differences in the GABAergic circuits of the thalamus that mediate ML and STT afferent information are believed to underlie differential somatosensory processing in the forebrain. We suggest that changes in thalamic GABAergic dendritic appendages and GABA receptors following CNS injury may play a role in the genesis of some central pain states.;;;RALSTON, HJ (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO, WM KECK FDN CTR INTEGRAT NEUROSCI, DEPT ANAT, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94143 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 21445, NS 23347] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;53;60;62;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Hierarchical levels of control, reflecting different levels of abstraction, are represented across prefrontal cortex (PFC). Although the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) is extensively interconnected with PFC, the role of MD in cognitive control is unclear. Tract tracer studies in macaques, involving subsets of PFC areas, have converged on coarse MD-PFC connectivity principles; but proposed finer-grained topographic schemes, which constrain interactions between MD and PFC, disagree in many respects. To investigate a unifying topographic scheme, we performed probabilistic tractography on diffusion MRI data from eight macaque monkeys, and estimated the probable paths connecting MD with each of all 19 architectonic areas of PFC. We found a connectional topography where the orderly progression from ventromedial to anterior to posterolateral PFC was represented from anteromedial to posterolateral MD. The projection zones of posterolateral PFC areas in MD showed substantial overlap, and those of ventral and anteromedial PFC areas in MD overlapped. The exception was cingulate area 24: its projection zone overlapped with projections zones of all other PFC areas. Overall, our data suggest that nearby, functionally related, directly connected PFC areas have partially overlapping projection zones in MD, consistent with a role for MD in coordinating communication across PFC. Indeed, the organizing principle for PFC projection zones in MD appears to reflect the flow of information across the hierarchical, multi-level PFC architecture. In addition, cingulate area 24 may have privileged access to influence thalamocortical interactions involving all other PFC areas.";"[Phillips, Jessica M.; Fish, Lesenia R.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Mohanta, Sounak; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Kecskemeti, Steven R.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Ctr, Brain Imaging Core, Madison, WI 53705 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";"Phillips, JM; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.";"jphillips7@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Redinbaugh, Michelle/0000-0003-1367-8606; Mohanta, Sounak/0000-0001-8169-446X; Phillips, Jessica M/0000-0002-8240-7327; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698";"National Institutes of Health [R01MH110311]; Whitehall Foundation [2015-12-71]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation [23017]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Whitehall Foundation; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health R01MH110311, Whitehall Foundation 2015-12-71 and Brain and Behavior Research Foundation 23017 grants.;;111;15;16;2;9;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;APR 1;2019;189;;;;;;832;846;;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.078;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.078;;;15;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";HO7YU;30711468;Green Accepted;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000461166900071;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, examination of the posteroventral retrosplenial region of the rhesus monkey in sections that were orthogonal to its axis of curvature (and therefore appropriate for architectonic analysis) has permitted definition of its architecture and precise extent. This analysis demonstrated that areas 29 and 30 of the retrosplenial cortex, as well as adjacent area 23 of the posterior cingulate cortex, extend together as an arch around the splenium of the corpus callosum and maintain their topographical relationship with one another throughout their entire course. Injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers confined to retrosplenial area 30 revealed that this area has reciprocal connections with adjacent areas 23, 19 and PGm, with the mid-dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex (areas 9, 9/46 and 46), with multimodal area TPO in the superior temporal sulcus, as well as the posterior parahippocampal cortex, the presubiculum and the entorhinal cortex.

In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals.;"[Cavanaugh, James; McAlonan, Kerry; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Cavanaugh, J (corresponding author), NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;jrc@lsr.nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health.;;36;7;7;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits.

The source of the thalamic projections from the medial mammillary nucleus showed strikingly different patterns of organization depending on the site of the injection within the two anterior thalamic nuclei, anterior medialis and anterior ventralis. These data reveal at least two distinct modes by which the primate medial mammillary bodies can regulate anterior thalamic function. Projections to the thalamic nucleus anterior medialis arise mainly from the pars lateralis of the medial mammillary nucleus. A particularly dense source is the dorsal cap in the posterior half of the pars lateralis, a subregion that has not previously been distinguished. In contrast, neurons spread evenly across the medial mammillary nucleus gave rise to projections more laterally in the anterior thalamic nuclei. A third pattern of medial mammillary neurons appeared to provide the source of projections to the rostral midline thalamic nuclei. In contrast, the labeled cells in the lateral mammillary nucleus were evenly spread across that nucleus, irrespective of injection site. In addition to the established projection to anterior dorsalis, the lateral mammillary nucleus appears to project lightly to a number of other thalamic nuclei, including lateralis dorsalis, anterior medialis, anterior ventralis, and the rostral midline nuclei, e.g. nucleus reuniens. These anatomical findings not only reveal novel ways of grouping the neurons within the medial mammillary nucleus, but also indicate that the mammillothalamic connections support cognition in multiple ways.;"NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Cardiff University";Saunders, RC (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;richardsaunders@mail.nih.gov;Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010;"Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308; Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773";;;;;52;38;38;0;4;BLACKWELL PUBLISHING;OXFORD;9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In a previous study (Hackett et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 394:475-95), we determined that the parabelt has topographic connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. Injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (MGd) and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM) nuclei. Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. The rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. The results suggest that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing, which is not influenced by direct inputs from primary cortical or subcortical auditory structures.

Indeed, models of basal ganglia function attribute the primary role for the thalamus to a simple relay of information processed in the basal ganglia to the cortex. The thalamic nuclear groups that are associated primarily with this function are the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. However, recent studies have shown that the corticothalamic projection is important for the dynamics of the thalamocortical processing. Furthermore, the relay nuclei that carry basal ganglia output to the cortex have recently been shown to project back to the basal ganglia directly.

Detailed anatomy and functional connectivity patterns of the thalamocortical system are essential to understanding the cortical organization and pathophysiology of a wide range of thalamus-related neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The current study used resting-state fMRI to investigate the topography of the human thalamocortical system from a functional perspective. The thalamus-related cortical networks were identified by performing independent component analysis on voxel-based thalamic functional connectivity maps across a large group of subjects. The resulting functional brain networks were very similar to well-established resting-state network maps. Using these brain network components in a spatial regression model with each thalamic voxel's functional connectivity map, we localized the thalamic subdivisions related to each brain network. For instance, the medial dorsal nucleus was shown to be associated with the default mode, the bilateral executive, the medial visual networks; and the pulvinar nucleus was involved in both the dorsal attention and the visual networks. These results revealed that a single nucleus may have functional connections with multiple cortical regions or even multiple functional networks, and may be potentially related to the function of mediation or modulation of multiple cortical networks. This observed organization of thalamocortical system provided a reference for studying the functions of thalamic sub-regions. The importance of intrinsic connectivity-based mapping of the thalamocortical relationship is discussed, as well as the applicability of the approach for future studies.";"[Yuan, Rui; Di, Xin; Gohel, Suril; Biswal, Bharat B.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Yuan, Rui] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Taylor, Paul A.] Univ Cape Town, MRC UCT Med Imaging Res Unit, Dept Human Biol, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Taylor, Paul A.] African Inst Math Sci, Muizenberg, Western Cape, South Africa; [Tsai, Yuan-Hsiung] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Diagnost Radiol, Chang Gung Mem Hosp Chiayi, Coll Med, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Tsai, Yuan-Hsiung] Chang Gung Univ, Sch Med Technol, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Biswal, Bharat B.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Radiol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA";"New Jersey Institute of Technology; New Jersey Institute of Technology; University of Cape Town; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Chang Gung University; Rutgers State University Newark; Rutgers State University New Brunswick";Biswal, BB (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.;bbiswal@yahoo.com;Di, Xin/B-2009-2009;"Di, Xin/0000-0002-2422-9016; Taylor, Paul/0000-0003-0488-6796";NIH [5R01 AG032088, DA038895, EB000215];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This research was supported by NIH 5R01 AG032088 (BBB), DA038895 (BBB), EB000215 (JSH).;;121;81;83;0;28;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what neural response a given MiSt will produce and possibly allow the development of natural sensation.  To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here, we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we used MiSt in the VPL of macaques, which have a somatosensory system more like humans, as compared to our previous rat work (Li et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post-stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt toward producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.";"[Francis, Joseph Thachil] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn & Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Francis, Joseph Thachil; Rozenboym, Anna; von Kraus, Lee; Xu, Shaohua; Chhatbar, Pratik; Semework, Mulugeta; Hawley, Emerson; Chapin, John] Suny Downstate Med Sch, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Rozenboym, Anna] CUNY, Kingsborough Community Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Chhatbar, Pratik] Duke Univ, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA";"University of Houston System; University of Houston; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Duke University";"Francis, JT (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn & Elect & Comp Engn, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;Francis, JT (corresponding author), Suny Downstate Med Sch, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA.";Joey199us@gmail.com;;;DARPA Grants [ONR N001498-00-C-8006, N660010-3-C-8041, N66001-10-C-2008];DARPA Grants;This work was supported by the DARPA Grants ONR N001498-00-C-8006 and N660010-3-C-8041 JC, and N66001-10-C-2008 JF.;;50;0;0;0;4;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-453X;;FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ;Front.

The immunostained cells are confined to the dorsal region of this nucleus along its rostrocaudal extent. Measurement of the somatic areas of the immunostained neurons indicated that they correspond to a population of large neurons thought to be projection neurons. Because dorsal paracentral neurons are known to project to the dorsal striatum and specific cortical areas involved in visual and visuomotor mechanisms, these structures might be modulated by cholinergic thalamic neurons.";Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morfol, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;Autonomous University of Madrid;Cavada, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morfol, Arzobispo Morcillo S-N, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.;;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Rico, Beatriz/0000-0002-0581-851X";;;;;36;31;35;0;6;BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Acting on this vital relay is another thalamic nucleus, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). This nucleus receives topographically organized collaterals from both thalamus and cortex and sends similarly organized projections back to thalamus. The inputs to the TRN are excitatory, but the output back to the thalamic relay is inhibitory, providing an ideal organization for modulating visual activity during early processing. This functional architecture led Crick in 1984 to hypothesize that TRN serves to direct a searchlight of attention to different regions of the topographic map; however, despite the substantial influence of this hypothesis, the activity of TRN neurons has never been determined during an attention task. We have determined the nature of the response of visual TRN neurons in awake monkeys, and the modulation of that response as the monkeys shifted attention between visual and auditory stimuli. Visual TRN neurons had a strong (194 spikes/s) and fast (25 ms latency) transient increase of activity to spots of light falling in their receptive fields, as well as high background firing rate (45 spikes/s). When attention shifted to the spots of light, the amplitude of the transient visual response typically increased, whereas other neuronal response characteristics remained unchanged. Thus, as predicted previously, TRN activity is modified by shifts of visual attention, and these attentional changes could influence visual processing in LGN via the inhibitory connections back to the thalamus.";NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20982 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";McAlonan, K (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 2A50,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20982 USA.;km@nei.nih.gov;;;Intramural NIH HHS Funding Source: Medline;Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);;;32;160;162;0;9;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9-17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

MMN is thought to represent a comparison of the features of the present stimulus versus a mnemonic template formed by the prior stimuli. METHODS: We used concurrent thalamic and primary auditory cortical (A1) laminar recordings in 7 macaques to evaluate the relative contributions of core (lemniscal) and matrix (nonlemniscal) thalamic afferents to MMN generation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that deviance-related activity is observed mainly in matrix regions of auditory thalamus, MMN generators are most prominent in layer 1 of cortex as opposed to sensory responses that activate layer 4 first and sequentially all cortical layers, and MMN is elicited independent of the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles. Consistent with prior reports, MMN-related thalamocortical activity was strongly inhibited by ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate distinct matrix versus core thalamocortical circuitry underlying the generation of a higher-order brain response (MMN) versus sensory responses.;"[Lakatos, Peter; O'Connell, Monica N.; Barczak, Annamaria; McGinnis, Tammy; Neymotin, Samuel; Schroeder, Charles E.; Smiley, John F.; Javitt, Daniel C.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY USA; [Lakatos, Peter; Smiley, John F.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.; Javitt, Daniel C.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; Columbia University; Columbia University";Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, 140 Old Orangeburg Rd, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Peter.Lakatos@nki.rfmh.org;Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019;"Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Neymotin, Samuel/0000-0003-3646-5195; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021";"National Institutes of Health [R01DC012947, R01MH109289, R01MH49334, P50MH109429]; Army Research Office [W911NF-19-1-0402]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Army Research Office";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant No. R01DC012947 [to PL and SN], Grant Nos.

In rats and mice RE is distinguished by bidirectional connections with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a role in memory and cognition. In primates, many foundational questions pertaining to RE remain unresolved. We addressed these issues by investigating the composition of the rhesus monkey RE in both sexes by labeling for GABA, a marker of inhibitory neurons, and for the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR), which label thalamic excitatory neurons that project to cortex. As in rats and mice, the macaque RE was mostly populated by CB and CR neurons, characteristic of matrix-dominant nuclei, and had bidirectional connections with hippocampus and mPFC area 25 (A25). Unlike rodents, we found GABAergic neurons in the monkey RE and a sparser but consistent population of core-associated thalamocortical PV neurons. RE had stronger connections with the basal amygdalar complex than in rats or mice. Amygdalar terminations were enriched with mitochondria and frequently formed successive synapses with the same postsynaptic structures, suggesting an active and robust pathway to RE. Significantly, hippocampal pathways formed multisynaptic complexes that uniquely involved excitatory projection neurons and dendrites of local inhibitory neurons in RE, extending this synaptic principle beyond sensory to high-order thalamic nuclei. Convergent pathways from hippocampus, A25, and amygdala in RE position it to flexibly coordinate activity for memory, cognition, and emotional context, which are disrupted in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases in humans.;"[Joyce, Mary Kate P.; Marshall, Laura G.; Banik, Shimrani L.; Wang, Jingyi; Xiao, Danqing; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Marshall, Laura G.; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wang, Jingyi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Xiao, Danqing] Regis Coll, STEM Dept, Weston, MA 02493 USA; [Bunce, Jamie G.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Joyce, Mary Kate P.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Regis University; Northeastern University; Yale University";"Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.";barbas@bu.edu;"wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023";"Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Wang, Jingyi/0000-0002-7903-0952; Marshall, Laura Garcia/0000-0001-7100-6846";National Institutes of Health [R01MH057414, R01MH117785];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01MH057414 and R01MH117785.

Methods: Thirty minutes before intraperitoneal induction of SE by Coriaria lactone (CL), rhesus monkeys were treated with LEV (15 or 150 mg/kg) delivered intravenously as a single bolus. CL dose and epileptic behavior were recorded. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before and during the experiment. All rhesus monkeys were killed after 1-month video monitoring and processed for pathological investigation of neuronal injury, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. Results: No animal exhibited spontaneous seizures during 1-month video monitoring. Development of acute SE was significantly inhibited in the group given 150 mg/kg LEV, compared with controls and the 15 mg/kg LEV group. Delayed latency, reduction of SE duration, decreased cumulative time of tonic convulsions, slight severity of SE, and a high CL induction dose were observed in the high LEV dose group (p < 0.05). The EEG showed less frequent epileptic discharges in the group administered with 150 mg/kg LEV. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, ultrastructural examination, TUNEL and GFAP staining revealed serious damage, including neuron loss, swollen mitochondrion, and strong positivity for TUNEL in the hippocampus and thalamus of controls, whereas moderate damage in the group administered with 15 mg/kg LEV, and very mild damage in the 150 mg/kg LEV group. Gliosis was found in the hippocampus of controls, not in the LEV groups and normal rhesus monkey.

To address this issue, the patterns of thalamic and cortical inputs to the rostral (CMAr), dorsal (CMAd), and ventral (CMAv) cingulate motor areas were investigated in the macaque monkey. Tracer injections were made into identified forelimb representations of these areas, and the distributions of retrogradely labeled neurons were analyzed in the thalamus and the frontal cortex. The cells of origin of thalamocortical projections to the CMAr were located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus and the oral division of the ventrolateral nucleus (VLo). On the other hand, the thalamocortical neurons to the CMAd/CMAv were distributed predominantly in the VLo and the oral division of the ventroposterolateral nucleus-the caudal division of the ventrolateral nucleus. Additionally, many neurons in the intralaminar nuclear group were seen to project to the cingulate motor areas. Except for their well-developed interconnections, the corticocortical projections to the CMAr and CMAd/CMAv were also distinctively preferential. Major inputs to the CMAr arose from the presupplementary motor area and the dorsal premotor cortex, whereas inputs to the CMAd/CMAv originated not only from these areas but also from the supplementary motor area and the primary motor cortex. The present results indicate that the CMAr and the caudal cingulate motor area (involving both the CMAd and the CMAv) are characterized by distinct patterns of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, reflecting their functional differences.

The locations of injection sites and resulting labeled neurons were further determined by relating sections processed to reveal tracers to those processed for myeloarchitecture in the cortex and multiple architectural stains in the thalamus. The ventroposterior medial subnucleus (VPM) for touch was identified as separate from the ventroposterior medial parvicellular nucleus (VPMpc) for taste by differential expression of several types of proteins. Our results revealed somatotopically matched projections from VPM to the part of 3b representing intra-oral structures and the face. Retrogradely labeled cells resulting from injections in area 3b were also found in other thalamic nuclei including: anterior pulvinar (Pa), ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior superior (VPS), ventroposterior lateral (VPL), ventral lateral (VL), center median (CM), central lateral (CL), and medial dorsal (MD). None of our injections, including those into the representation of the tongue, labeled neurons in VPMpc, the thalamic taste nucleus. Thus, area 3b does not appear to be involved in processing taste information from the thalamus. This result stands in contrast to those reported for New World monkeys. J. Comp.

This is reflected by the influence of thalamic stimulation on cortical activity and behavior as well as apparently cortical lesion syndromes occurring as a function of small thalamic insults. Here, we attempt to noninvasively test the correspondence of structural and functional connectivity of the human thalamus using diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI. Using a large sample of 102 adults, we apply tensor independent component analysis to diffusion MRI tractography data to blindly parcellate bilateral thalamus according to diffusion tractography-defined structural connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI collected in the same subjects, we show that the resulting structurally defined thalamic regions map to spatially distinct, and anatomically predictable, whole-brain functional networks in the same subjects. Although there was significant variability in the functional connectivity patterns, the resulting 51 structural and functional patterns could broadly be reduced to a subset of 7 similar core network types. These networks were distinct from typical cortical resting-state networks. Importantly, these networks were distributed across the brain and, in a subset, map extremely well to known thalamocortico-basal-ganglial loops.;"[O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan; Barker, Gareth J.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Neuroimaging, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Keller, Simon S.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Mol & Clin Pharmacol, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Keller, Simon S.] Walton Ctr Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Dept Radiol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Richardson, Mark P.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Clin Neurosci, London WC2R 2LS, England";"University of London; King's College London; N8 Research Partnership; University of Liverpool; Walton Centre; University of London; King's College London";O'Muircheartaigh, J (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Neuroimaging Sci, Dept Neuroimaging, P089, London SE5 8AF, England.;jonathanom@kcl.ac.uk;"O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan/D-8154-2011; Richardson, Mark P/E-5385-2010; Keller, Simon/IQR-7228-2023; Barker, Gareth J/C-9616-2009";"Richardson, Mark P/0000-0001-8925-3140; Barker, Gareth J/0000-0002-5214-7421; Keller, Simon/0000-0001-5247-9795; O'Muircheartaigh, Jonathan/0000-0002-8033-6959";"Wellcome Trust [096195]; UK Medical Research Council grant [MR/K023152/1]; UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant [MR/K013998/1]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsey NHS Foundation Trust; MRC [MR/K013998/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/K013998/1] Funding Source: researchfish";"Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); UK Medical Research Council grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UK Medical Research Council Programme Grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Maudsey NHS Foundation Trust; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";J.O.M. is supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant Number 096195).

Previous work has shown that parenchymal delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) in the thalamus by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) can lead to largescale transduction via axonal transport in distal areas including cortex. We used this approach to obtain widespread cortical expression of light-sensitive ion channels. New method: AAV vectors co-expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes were infused into thalamus of three rhesus macaques under MR-guided CED. After six to twelve weeks recovery, in vivo optical stimulation and single cell recording in the cortex was carried out using an optrode in anesthetized animals. Post-mortem immunostaining against YFP was used to estimate the distribution and level of expression of ChR2 in thalamus and cortex. Results: Histological analysis revealed high levels of transduction in cortical layers. The patterns of expression were consistent with known thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits. Dense expression was seen in thalamocortiocal axonal fibers in layers III, IV and VI and in pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI, presumably corticothalamic neurons. In addition we obtained reliable in vivo light-evoked responses in cortical areas with high levels of expression. Comparison with existing methods: Thalamic CED is very efficient in achieving large expressing areas in comparison to convectional techniques both in minimizing infusion time and in minimizing damage to the brain. Conclusion: MR-guided CED infusion into thalamus provides a simplified approach to transduce large cortical areas by thalamo-cortico-thalamic projections in primate brain. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In humans, similar to 3.4 million afferents from the LGN are distributed within a V1 surface of similar to 2400 mm(2), an afferent number that is reduced by half in the macaque and by more than two orders of magnitude in the mouse. Thalamocortical afferents are sorted in visual cortex based on the spatial position of their receptive fields to form a map of visual space. The visual resolution within this map is strongly correlated with total number of thalamic afferents that V1 receives and the area available to sort them. The similar to 20,000 afferents of the mouse are only sorted by spatial position because they have to cover a large visual field (similar to 300 deg) within just 4 mm(2) of V1 area. By contrast, the similar to 500,000 afferents of the cat are also sorted by eye input and light/dark polarity because they cover a smaller visual field (similar to 200 deg) within a much larger V1 area (similar to 400 mm(2)), a sorting principle that is likely to apply also to macaques and humans. The increased precision of thalamic sorting allows building multiple copies of the V1 visual map for left/right eyes and light/dark polarities, which become interlaced to keep neurons representing the same visual point close together. In turn, this interlaced arrangement makes cortical neurons with different preferences for stimulus orientation to rotate around single cortical points forming a pinwheel pattern that allows more efficient processing of objects and visual textures.;"[Mazade, Reece; Alonso, Jose Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;;NIH [EY027157, EY05253];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);Supported by NIH grants EY027157 (RM) and EY05253 (JMA).;;122;18;18;2;15;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN;2017;34;;;;;;;;e007;10.1017/S0952523817000049;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523817000049;;;9;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";FG0IB;28965507;Green Accepted;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000409404300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Three such networks are centered on lateral orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal and cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex and all have been identified with distinct cognitive roles. Although these areas differ in a number of their cortical connections, some of the first anatomical evidence for these networks came from tracer studies demonstrating their distinct patterns of connectivity with the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus. Here, we present evidence for a similar topography of MD thalamus prefrontal connections, using non-invasive imaging and diffusion tractography (DWI-DT) in human and macaque. DWI-DT suggested that there was a high probability of interconnection between medial MD and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, between caudodorsal MD and medial frontal/cingulate cortex, and between lateral MD and lateral prefrontal cortex, in both species. Within the lateral prefrontal cortex a dorsolateral region (the principal sulcus in the macaque and middle frontal gyrus in the human) was found to have a high probability of interconnection with the MD region between the regions with a high probability of interconnection with other parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex and with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. In addition to suggesting that the thalamic connectivity in the macaque is a good guide to human prefrontal cortex, and therefore that there are likely to be similarities in the cognitive roles played by the prefrontal areas in both species, the present results are also the first to provide insight into the topography of projections of an individual thalamic nucleus in the human brain.

In three macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we observed up to five finger-like protrusions that emanated from the posterior pole of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extended posteriorly between the lateral pulvinar and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. These anomalous fingers measured up to 1.7 mm in length and contained dense accumulations of neurons and glia. The fingers received a direct retinal input from the contralateral eye indicating that they were part of the LGN rather than of other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In order to determine with which subcompartment(s) of the LGN the fingers were associated (parvocellular, magnocellular, or intercalated layers), we examined the immunochemical properties and size of neurons in the fingers and LGN subcompartments. We concluded that the fingers were not associated with the intercalated layers, since neurons in the fingers did not stain with an antibody to calbindin-D28k, whereas intercalated neurons stained intensely with this antibody. In addition, neurons located in the fingers were significantly smaller than those found in the magnocellular layers but were not significantly different in size from neurons in the parvocellular layers. We therefore consider that the fingers are an anomaly of the parvocellular subcompartment of the LGN. Interestingly, in two of the three cases with anomalous fingers, we also observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae, suggesting that these two anomalies were related. In five additional animals, however, we observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae without anomalous fingers. Thus, if there are common mechanisms underlying the development of both anomalous fingers and subsidiary layers, our data indicate that they do not always result in the concomitant expression of both anomalies.;;;OBrien, BJ (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT PSYCHOL,GRAD PROGRAM BEHAV NEUROSCI,BOX 351525,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.;;O'Brien, Brendan/D-1165-2009;;;;;;25;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0302-766X;;;CELL TISSUE RES;Cell Tissue Res.;JUL;1997;289;1;;;;;11;16;;10.1007/s004410050847;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004410050847;;;6;Cell Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Cell Biology;XG820;9182596;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1997XG82000002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated the distribution of thalamocortical neurons projecting to forelimb representations of the SMA and the MI using a multiple retrograde labeling technique in the monkey. The forelimb area of the SMA, and the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI were identified by electrophysiological techniques of intracortical microstimulation and single neuron recording. Injections were made into these three representations with three different dyes in the same animal (horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin, diamidino yellow, and fast blue), and the thalamic neurons were retrogradely labeled. Injections into the SMA densely labeled thalamic neurons in nuclei ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo), ventralis lateralis pars medialis (VLm) and ventralis lateralis pars caudalis (VLc), but not in nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo). Injections into the MI labeled thalamic neurons primarily in VLo, VLc, and VPLo. We found that the distribution of projection neurons to the three areas was largely separate in the thalamus. However, in the middle part of VLo, and in a limited portion of VLc, thalamic neurons projecting to the SMA partially overlapped with those to the distal forelimb area of the MI. They overlapped little with those to the proximal forelimb area of the MI. We noted no overlap between the distributions of thalamic projection neurons to the distal and proximal forelimb areas of the MI. These findings suggest that the SMA. and MI receive separate information from the thalamus, while sharing minor sources of common inputs.

In Old World monkeys, rostral and caudal aspects of the hand representation are located in the precentral gyrus and the anterior bank of the central sulcus, respectively. We previously reported the organization of the cortico-cortical connections of the grasp zone in rostral M1. Here we describe the organization of thalamocortical connections that were labeled from the same tracer injections. Thalamocortical connections of a grasp zone in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the M1 orofacial representation are included for direct comparison. The M1 grasp zone was primarily connected with ventral lateral divisions of motor thalamus. The largest proportion of inputs originated in the posterior division (VLp) followed by the medial and the anterior divisions. Thalamic inputs to the M1 grasp zone originated in more lateral aspects of VLp as compared to the origins of thalamic inputs to the M1 orofacial representation. Inputs to M1 from thalamic divisions connected with cerebellum constituted three fold the density of inputs from divisions connected with basal ganglia, whereas the ratio of inputs was more balanced for the grasp zone in PMv. Privileged access of the cerebellothalamic pathway to the grasp zone in rostral M1 is consistent with the connection patterns previously reported for the precentral gyrus. Thus, cerebellar nuclei are likely more involved than basal ganglia nuclei with the contributions of rostral M1 to manual dexterity.;"[Gharbawie, Omar A.; Stepniewska, Iwona; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Gharbawie, Omar A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Syst Neurosci Inst, Dept Neurobiol,Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Gharbawie, Omar A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, 3501 Fifth Ave,4069 BST 3, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";"Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Syst Neurosci Inst, Dept Neurobiol,Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Gharbawie, OA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, 3501 Fifth Ave,4069 BST 3, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.";omar@pitt.edu;;;"CIHR Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY002686] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [U54 HD083211] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R00 NS079471, K99 NS079471, R03 NS055843] Funding Source: Medline";"CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;49;1;1;1;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

The primate thalamus is densely and heterogeneously innervated with dopaminergic axons, most of which express the dopamine transporter, as does the nigrostriatal system. We hypothesized that dopamine depletion may be present in the thalamus of the parkinsonian brain and set out to ascertain possible regional differences. Methods The toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was administered to adult macaque monkeys using a slow intoxication protocol. The treated macaques were classified into 2 groups according to their motor status: nonsymptomatic and parkinsonian. Dopamine innervation was studied with immunohistochemistry for the dopamine transporter. Topographic maps of the dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon distribution were generated and the total length and length density of these axons stereologically estimated using a 3-dimensional fractionator. Results Parkinsonian macaques exhibited lower dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density than controls in mediodorsal and centromedian-parafascicular nuclei. Dopamine denervation in the mediodorsal nucleus was already noticeable in nonsymptomatic macaques and was even greater in parkinsonian macaques. Reticular nucleus dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon length density presented an inverse pattern, increasing progressively to the maximum density seen in parkinsonian macaques. No changes were observed in ventral thalamic nuclei. Dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axon maps supported the quantitative findings. Conclusions Changes in the dopamine innervation of various thalamic nuclei are heterogeneous and start in the premotor parkinsonian stage. These changes may be involved in some poorly understood nonmotor manifestations of PD. (c) 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society;"[Monje, Mariana H.

Paired intracortical deposits of Fast blue (FB) and Diamidino yellow (DY) separated by 100-1500 mu m were made by inserting crystals of dye into the tracks of tungsten microelectrodes used to record receptive field data on area 3b cells. Each injection gave retrograde labeling of one or more clusters of cells extending in elongated anteroposterior arrays through the ventral posterior medial (VPM) or ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus. Double-labeled cells were only found when the distance between the centers of the dye deposits was less than 600 mu m. With interdeposit distances greater than 600 mu m, most clusters of retrogradely labeled cells had a majority of cells labeled by FB or DY, However, even with interdeposit distances of 1-1.5 mm the labeled clusters also contained significant numbers of cells labeled with the other dye. These results and an accompanying regression analysis indicate that the extent of intracortical arborization of single thalamocortical axons in area 3b is no greater than 600 pm. However, adjoining cells in the same part of the thalamic body representation can project to cortical targets as discrepant as 1.5 mm. It is proposed that the fine grain of the cortical representation depends upon inputs from the majority population of each thalamic cell cluster. However, divergent and convergent projections from minority populations of the clusters form a preexisting basis for rapid changes in the cortical representational map under activity-dependent conditions.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;Rausell, Estrella/L-8781-2014;Rausell Tamayo, Estrella/0000-0002-1129-7116;NINDS NIH HHS [NS22317, NS21377] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;61;58;58;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Here, we examine neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus, with focus on the mediodorsal (MD) and the anterior nuclei (ANT), to determine if neurogenesis of rostral and caudal thalamic nuclei is concurrent or instead temporally staggered. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N = 10) of [H-3]dT labeled specimens, with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Slides were scanned to create digital images for subsequent analysis using Stereo Investigator software. Labeled neurons were mapped within a contour that encompassed the entire rostral thalamus. These maps were superimposed onto closely corresponding sections from the online BrainMaps macaque atlas to facilitate analysis. Our novel approach uncovered a previously undetected spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus. At E30, labeled neurons were located in a compact medial band; at E38-E40, labeling was dense ventrolaterally, and at E43, labeling predominated laterally at rostral levels and was widely distributed at caudal levels. Peak neurogenesis occurs earlier in MD (E30-E43) and ANT (E31-E43) than in LGN (E36-E43) and PUL (E36-E45).

These afferents may arise from neocortex or from subcortical centers; however, their exact distribution, segregation, or putative absence in given thalamic nuclei are unknown. To unravel the nucleus-specific composition of drivers, we mapped the entire macaque thalamus using vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 to label cortical and subcortical afferents, respectively. Large thalamic territories were innervated exclusively by either giant vGLUT2- or vGLUT1-positive boutons. Codistribution of drivers with different origin was not abundant. In several thalamic regions, no giant terminals of any type could be detected at light microscopic level. Electron microscopic observation of these territories revealed either the complete absence of large multisynaptic excitatory terminals (basal ganglia-recipient nuclei) or the presence of both vGLUT1- and vGLUT2-positive terminals, which were significantly smaller than their giant counterparts (intralaminar nuclei, medial pulvinar). In the basal ganglia-recipient thalamus, giant inhibitory terminals replaced the excitatory driver inputs. The pulvinar and the mediodorsal nucleus displayed subnuclear heterogeneity in their driver assemblies. These results show that distinct thalamic territories can be under pure subcortical or cortical control; however, there is significant variability in the composition of major excitatory inputs in several thalamic regions. Because thalamic information transfer depends on the origin and complexity of the excitatory inputs, this suggests that the computations performed by individual thalamic regions display considerable variability. Finally, the map of driver distribution may help to resolve the morphological basis of human diseases involving different parts of the thalamus.";"[Rovo, Zita; Acsady, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Lab Thalamus Res, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary";"Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Institute of Experimental Medicine; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University";Acsady, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, POB 67, H-1450 Budapest, Hungary.;acsady@koki.hu;"Acsady, Laszlo/C-7773-2014; Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010";"Acsady, Laszlo/0000-0002-0679-2980; ";"Wellcome Trust; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA T 75676, OTKA 81357]; National Office for Research and Technology-ANR TeT";"Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); National Office for Research and Technology-ANR TeT(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (a Wellcome Project Grant to L.

We investigated how multiple projection systems to the thalamus are organized in prefrontal cortex after injection of distinct retrograde tracers in the principal mediodorsal (MD), the limbic anterior medial (AM), and the motor-related ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Neurons projecting to these nuclei were organized in interdigitated modules extending vertically within layers VI and V. Projection neurons were also organized in layers. The majority of projection neurons to MID or AM originated in layer VI (similar to 80%), but a significant proportion (similar to 20%) originated in layer V. In contrast, prefrontal neurons projecting to VA/VL were equally distributed in layers V and VI. Neurons directed to VA/VL occupied mostly the upper part of layer V, while neurons directed to MD or AM occupied mostly the deep part of layer V. The highest proportions of projection neurons in layer V to each nucleus were found in dorsal and medial prefrontal areas. The laminar organization of prefrontal cortico-thalamic projections differs from sensory systems, where projections originate predominantly or entirely from layer VI. Previous studies indicate that layer V corticothalamic neurons innervate through some large terminals thalamic neurons that project widely to superficial cortical layers. The large population of prefrontal projection neurons in layer V may drive thalamic neurons, triggering synchronization by recruiting several cortical areas through widespread thalamocortical projections to layer I. These pathways may underlie the synthesis of cognition, emotion and action. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Area 46 has complex connections with somatosensory, visual, visuomotor, motor, and limbic systems and a key role in cognition, which frequently declines with age. An important question is what alterations might account for this decline. We are nowhere near having a complete answer, but as will be shown in this review, it is now evident that there is no single underlying cause. There is no significant loss of cortical neurons and although there are a few senile plaques in rhesus monkey cortex, their frequency does not correlate with cognitive decline. However, as discussed in this review, the following do correlate with cognitive decline. Loss of white matter has been proposed to result in some disconnections between parts of the central nervous system and changes in the structure of myelin sheaths reduce conduction velocity and the timing in neuronal circuits. In addition, there are reductions in the inputs to cortical neurons, as shown by regression of dendritic trees, loss of dendritic spines and synapses, and alterations in transmitters and receptors. These factors contribute to alterations in the intrinsic and network physiological properties of cortical neurons. As more details emerge, it is to be hoped that effective interventions to retard cognitive decline can be proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.";;;Percheron, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, LAB NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPT MOUVEMENT, INSERM U106, F-75015 PARIS, FRANCE.;;"Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013; Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;387;158;159;0;28;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-0173;1872-6321;;BRAIN RES REV;Brain Res.

In labeling experiments, four macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received injections of biotinylated dextran amine and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into the cerebellar nuclei or internal segment of the globus pallidus and cervical segments of the spinal cord, respectively. Each tracer was visualized in brain sections by sequentially using a different chromogen. Labeled terminals were plotted and superimposed on adjacent brain sections processed for Nissl substance, acetylcholinesterase, and the antigens for calbindin and Cat-301 to reveal thalamic nuclei. The labeled cerebellar terminals were distributed throughout the posterior VL (VLp), whereas the labeled pallidothalamic terminals were concentrated in the anterior VL and the ventral anterior nucleus. The spinothalamic input was directed mostly to the ventral posterior complex and cells just caudal to it. In addition, the patches of spinothalamic terminations intermingled and partly overlapped with the cerebellothalamic, but not with the pallidothalamic terminations within VLp. The regions of overlap of somatosensory and cerebellar inputs within the VLp of the present study appear to correspond to the reported locations of the tremor-related cells in parkinsonian patients. Thus, the overlapping spinothalamic and cerebellar inputs may provide a substrate for the altered activity of motor thalamic neurons in such patients.;"Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Program Neurosci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University";Stepniewska, I (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;iwona.stepniewska@vanderbilt.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS 38564] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;84;52;53;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Calretinin immunoreactivity was weak in the geniculate bodies and in nuclei of the ventral and posterior groups, moderate in the reticular nucleus and in nuclei of the anterior, medial, and lateral groups, and strong in nuclei of the midline group and anterior intralaminar nuclei. The mediodorsal nucleus was unique among thalamic nuclei because it contained a wide variety of intensely immunostained perikarya embedded in a moderately-labelled neuropil. The reticular nucleus displayed several small and uniformly distributed neuronal clusters composed of immunostained perikarya lying in a moderately-labelled neuropil. Intense and uniform immunostaining was observed in all midline nuclei and in the anterior intralaminar nuclei, including the paracentral and central lateral nuclei. These nuclei, which harboured numerous intensely-stained perikarya lying in a dense immunoreactive neuropil, were the most strongly-immunoreactive structures of the entire human thalamus. At the level of the posterior intralaminar nuclei, the central median nucleus was virtually free of immunostaining whereas the parafascicular nucleus was moderately labelled. The nucleus submedius located just beneath the central median/parafascicular complex displayed a very intense calretinin immunostaining. This study has provided evidence for the presence of the protein calretinin in the human thalamus. The pattern of distribution of calretinin, as delineated in the present study, suggests that this calcium-binding protein may participate in various subcortical and cortical thalamic systems involved in the modulation of emotional and motivational states.

This study examined the connections of MITN in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Experiments with retrograde and anterograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) showed that MITN are strongly connected with the medial prefrontal network. The dorsal nuclei of the midline thalamus, including the paraventricular (Pa) and parataenial nuclei (Pt), had heavy connections with medial network areas 25, 32, and 14c in the subgenual region. Areas 13a and 12o, which are associated with both networks, were strongly connected with the Pt and the central intermedial nucleus, respectively. Otherwise, orbital network areas had weak connections with MITN. Anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline thalamus resulted in heavy terminal labeling in the medial prefrontal network, most notably in areas ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum (25, 32, and 14c), but also in adjacent areas (13a and 13b). Retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline labeled similar areas. The medial network, particularly the subgenual region, is involved in visceral and emotional control and has been implicated in mood disorders. The strong connections between the subgenual cortex and the Pa provide a pathway through which stress signals from the Pa may influence these prefrontal circuits.

The following findings were obtained. The superficial thalamocortical (T-C) projections, terminating in the (superficial half of) cortical layer I, arise mainly from the nucleus ventralis anterior, pars principalis (VApc) and nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and possibly from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis (VLm) and nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc). The VApc gives rise to the superficial T-C and deep T-C projections onto the postarcuate premotor area around the arcuate genu and spur, and onto the dorsomedial part of the caudal premotor area as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA). The VApc also gives rise to only deep T-C projections onto the remaining premotor area and onto the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus as well as the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level of the premotor area. The VLo gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the ventrolateral part of the motor area (mainly to the forelimb motor area) and onto the dorsomedial part to the mesial cortex at the rostral level of the motor area. The VAmc gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the banks of the arcuate genu and adjacent region of area 8. Area X, the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc), nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and possibly the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) send only deep T-C projections. The dorsal and medial parts of the VLc project onto the premotor area, the rostral part of the motor area and the SMA, and also the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Area X projects onto the premotor area, the SMA, and the caudal part of area 8.

However, the underlying basis for this topography as it relates to the organization of the different architectonically defined areas of the prefrontal cortex has not been systematically studied. In the present investigation we have reassessed the thalamic projections from the different architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex by using the technique of autoradiography in the rhesus monkey. The results show that the prefrontomediodorsal projections are organized according to the architectonic differentiation of the prefrontal cortices. Thus architectonically less differentiated medial and orbital prefrontal regions project to the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision. In contrast, highly differentiated prefrontal area 8 projects to the most lateral sector of the mediodorsal nucleus, the multiformis subdivision. Lateral prefrontal areas with intermediate architectonic features project to the central parvocellular sector of the mediodorsal nucleus. Additionally, these projections also reveal a dorsoventral topography. Thus areas in the medial and dorsolateral cortices project to the dorsal part of the mediodorsal nucleus. In contrast, areas in orbital and ventrolateral cortices project to the ventral part of the mediodorsal nucleus. The topographic organization of the corticothalamic connections described in this study corresponds to the progressive elaboration and differentiation of the architectonic features of the different prefrontal areas. This successive and dichotomous organization of prefrontothalamic connections may provide the basis for the observed differential functions of the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal nucleus.;BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA;Boston University;SIWEK, DF (corresponding author), EDITH NOURSE ROGERS MEM VET ADM HOSP, 200 SPRINGS RD, BEDFORD, MA 01730 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS16842] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;140;80;82;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

This study attempts to identify the correlation between thalamic relay cells and functional activity evoked in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) of cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys. Wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA:HRP) was iontophoretically injected into physiologically determined sites in the somatosensory cortex, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminals in corresponding somatosensory thalamic regions. In the same animals, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) experiments were carried out 2 days later, using the somatic stimuli identified as best exciting the cortical neurons. Stimulation to the limbs produced crescent-shaped clusters of metabolic label arranged in a somatotopically organized fashion in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Following WGA:HRP injections into area 3b, the stimulus-evoked 2DG label was colocalized with the retrograde and anterograde tracer. This finding suggests that the location of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity can be predicted by the presence of transported WGA:HRP clusters.;;;MA, W (corresponding author), UNIFORMED SERV UNIV HLTH SCI,DEPT ANAT,4301 JONES BRIDGE RD,BETHESDA,MD 20814, USA.;;Juliano, Sharon/AAO-1030-2020;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 24014] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;27;4;4;0;0;GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC;NEW YORK;72 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

Such dual pattern of corticothalamic projections is well established in rodents and cats for many cortical areas. In non-human primates (monkeys), it has been reported for the primary sensory cortices (A1, V1, S1), the motor and premotor cortical areas and, in the parietal lobe, also for area 7. The present study aimed first at refining the cytoarchitecture parcellation of area 5 into the sub-areas PE and PEa and, second, establishing whether area 5 also exhibits this dual pattern of corticothalamic projection and what is its precise topography. To this aim, the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected in area PE in one monkey and in area PEa in a second monkey. Area PE sends a major projection terminating with small endings to the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus (LP), ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL), medial pulvinar (PuM) and, but fewer, to ventral lateral posterior nucleus, dorsal division (VLpd), central lateral nucleus (CL) and center median nucleus (CM), whereas giant endings formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL and PuM. For area PEa, the corticothalamic projection formed by small endings was found mainly in LP, VPL, anterior pulvinar (PuA), lateral pulvinar (PuL), PuM and, to a lesser extent, in ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), CL, mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and CM. Giant endings originating from area PEa formed restricted terminal fields in LP, VPL, PuA, PuM, MD and PuL. Furthermore, the origin of the thalamocortical projections to areas PE and PEa was established, exhibiting clusters of neurons in the same thalamic nuclei as above, in other words predominantly in the caudal thalamus. Via the giant endings CT projection, areas PE and PEa may send feedforward, transthalamic projections to remote cortical areas in the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes contributing to polysensory and sensorimotor integration, relevant for visual guidance of reaching movements for instance.

In each monkey, different fluorescent retrograde tracers (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow) were injected separately into the distaI and proximal forelimb areas of the primary motor cortex after physiological mapping with intracortical microstimulation. In the same individual monkeys, an anterograde tracer, wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was injected into the internal segment of the globus pallidus after the forelimb part was identified physiologically. A small group of projection neurons to the distal and proximal representations of the motor cortex were found in the terminal fields from the pallidum, but a majority of the projection neurons were distributed outside the terminal area in the thalamus. These results confirm the existence of the pathway from the pallidum through the thalamus to the primary motor cortex, but also indicate that the primary motor cortex receives its major thalamic inputs from outside of the pallidal projection area, and that the pallidum sends its major outputs to nonprimary motor areas through the thalamus.

Over the course of the last decades, diverse attempts have been made to map and describe subcortical neuromodulatory afferents to the primate thalamus, including axons using acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and histamine. Our group has been actively involved in this endeavor. The published descriptions on neuromodulatory afferents to the primate thalamus have been made in different laboratories and are not fully comparable due to methodological divergences (for example, fixation procedures, planes of cutting, techniques used to detect the afferents, different criteria for identification of thalamic nuclei horizontal ellipsis ). Such variation affects the results obtained. Therefore, systematic methodological and analytical approaches are much needed. The present article proposes reproducible methodological and terminological frameworks for primate thalamic mapping. We suggest the use of standard stereotaxic planes to produce and present maps of the primate thalamus, as well as the use of the Anglo-American school terminology (vs. the German school terminology) for identification of thalamic nuclei. Finally, a public repository of the data collected under agreed-on frameworks would be a useful tool for looking up and comparing data on the structure and connections of primate thalamic nuclei. Important and agreed-on efforts are required to create, manage, and fund a unified and homogeneous resource of data on the primate thalamus.

Neurosurgeons mostly use the stereotactic atlas of Schaltenbrand with Hassler's nomenclature of the thalamus. Neuroanatomists use different nomenclatures for the primate thalamus. The cytoarchitectonic definition of nuclei is difficult in the motor thalamus. and it would be best to define the nuclei based on their subcortical afferents. However, tracing studies are not available in humans. Thus, human thalamic nomenclature is based entirely on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and transfer of knowledge by analogy from monkey to man. Problems arise when trying to transfer the detailed knowledge from monkey to the human brain. By doing so, different authors have come to different conclusions concerning the subcortical afferents of Hassler's motor nuclei, which inevitably leads to confusion when attempting neurophysiological interpretations of the surgical data. The present review draws attention to the discrepancies and open questions in the literature. There is a need to better define the limits of the sensory and cerebellar afferent receiving thalamic nuclei as well as those of the cerebellar and pallidal afferent receiving territories in humans.

The mediodorsal thalamus receives a large projection from the rhinal cortex, and has been implicated in recognition memory performance. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier studies, then examined the effect of bilaterally ablating the medial portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Mediodorsal lesion impaired postoperative delayed matching-to-sample performance with a large stimulus set, but had no effect on performance of DMS with a small stimulus population. In comparison with the earlier data from rhinal cortex lesions with the same methods, wherever a deficit was seen in the rhinal-lesioned animals the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals showed a smaller deficit. We conclude that other efferents from the rhinal cortex, possibly those to the adjacent inferior temporal cortex, enable better performance in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus-lesioned animals than in the animals with rhinal cortex ablation.;"Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England; Univ Durham, Dept Psychol, Sci Labs, Durham DH1 LE, England";"University of Oxford; N8 Research Partnership; Durham University";Parker, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England.;;Eacott, madeline J/D-6194-2013;Eacott, madeline J/0000-0002-1694-2137;;;;;25;60;60;0;1;BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Thalamic labeling was analyzed following injections of the anterograde tracers, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPI) and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the contralateral cerebellar interpositus and dentate nuclei. In addition, the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the physiologically identified hand/arm representation of SMA. The tissue was processed sequentially using different chromogens in order to visualize all three tracers in a single section. We found that the SMA thalamocortical neurons occupied a wide band extending from the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) through the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars medialis (VLm) and into to the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc) including a portion of ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X. The heaviest CTB labeling was found in VLo with dense plexuses of BDA labeled pallidothalamic fibers and swellings often observed superimposed upon retrogradely labeled CTB cells. In addition, dense foci of cerebellothalamic WGA-HRP anterograde label were observed coinciding with the occasional retrogradely CTB labeled neurons in VLc and transitional zones between VApc, VLo and VPLo.

Yet, the distribution of GABA(B) receptors in the thalamus has only been studied in the rat, and there is no comparable information in primates. The potent GABA(B) receptor antagonist [H-3]CGP 62349 was used to study the distribution and binding properties of the receptor in control monkeys and those with small ibotenic acid lesions in the anterodorsal segment of the nucleus reticularis thalami. Eight-micrometer-thick cryostat sections of the fresh frozen brains were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the ligand. Autoradiographs were analysed using a quantitative image analysis technique, and binding parameters were calculated for select thalamic nuclei as well as basal ganglia structures present in the same sections. The overall number of GABA(B) binding sites in the monkey thalamus and basal ganglia was several-fold higher than previously reported values for the rat. In the thalamus, the receptors were distributed rather uniformly and the binding densities and affinities were high (B-max range of 245.5-437.9 fmol/mg of tissue, K-d range of 0.136-0.604 nM). In the basal ganglia, the number of binding sites and the affinities were lower (B-max range of 51.1-244.2 fmol/mg of tissue; Kd range of 0.416-1.394 nM), and the differences between nuclei were more pronounced, with striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta displaying the highest binding densities. Seven days post-lesion, a 20-30% decrease in B-max values (P < 0.05) was found in the nuclei receiving input from the lesioned nucleus reticularis thalami sector (the mediodorsal nucleus and densicellular and magnocellular parts of the ventral anterior nucleus) without changes in affinity. No significant changes were detected in any other structures. The results of the lesioning experiments suggest that a portion of thalamic GABA(B) receptors is in a presynaptic location on the nucleus reticularis thalami efferents. The overall distribution pattern in the thalamus also suggests a partial association of GABA(B) receptors with corticothalamic terminals presynaptically. (C) 1999 IBRO.

Attention focused on the routes taken by these projections, which were delineated by combining surgical tract section with the placement of a tracer. Projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei almost exclusively used the fornix. These relatively light projections, which arose from all areas of the entorhinal cortex, from the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and area 35 of the perirhinal cortex, terminated mainly in the anterior ventral nucleus. In contrast, the projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus from the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum were denser than those to the anterior thalamic nuclei. The projections to the lateral dorsal nucleus used two routes. While nearly all of the projections from the subicular complex used the fornix, many of the entorhinal cortex projections passed caudally in the temporopulvinar bundle to reach the lateral dorsal nucleus. The perirhinal cortex, as well as the entorhinal cortex, also projects to nucleus medialis dorsalis. These projections exclusively used the external capsule and thence the inferior thalamic peduncle. Other temporal-thalamic projections included those to the medial pulvinar, via the temporopulvinar bundle, from the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, and those to the paraventricular nucleus from the entorhinal cortex. By identifying these routes, it is possible to appreciate how different lesions might disconnect temporal-diencephalic pathways and so contribute to memory disorders.;"Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;aggleton@cf.ac.uk;;Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308;;;;;73;82;83;0;5;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

This report analyzes the distribution of the GABA-producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), stained with monoclonal antibody, in human and rhesus monkey thalami and compares it with staining patterns of some widely used cytoskeletal and calcium binding protein markers. GAD65 immunoreactivity distinctly labeled two systems: fibers and terminals of basal ganglia thalamic afferents and local circuit neurons, revealing fine features of GABAergic circuitry in the human thalamus. Gross distribution patterns of GAD65 were identical in human and rhesus monkey thalami. The area displaying specific staining of large-caliber beaded fibers coincided with nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent territories previously identified in monkeys with anterograde tracers. Accordingly, a similarly stained region in the human thalamus was considered basal ganglia territory. Except for cytoarchitecture, no specific markers differentiating between the nigro- and pallidothalamic projection zones within this territory were found. GAD65 staining in the cerebellar afferent territory reflected organization of its local circuit neuron network, distinguishing it from adjacent nuclei. Specific GAD65 staining pattern and negative calcium binding protein immunoreactivity identify the cerebellar afferent territory in humans. It is subdivided further into ventral and dorsal regions based on the cytoskeletal protein SMI31 staining pattern. The nuclear outlines revised according to the results are compared with those of Hassler (Schaltenbrand G and Bailey P [1959] Einfuhrung in die stereotaktishen Operationen mit einem Atlas des menschlichen Gehirns, vol 3.

Methods: High-resolution MR images were acquired in patients with schizophrenia (n=106) and normal comparison subjects (n=42). Patients were divided into good-outcome (n=52) and poor-outcome (Kraepelinian, n=54) subtypes based on their ability for self-care. Correlations between the relative gray and white matter volumes of the individual cortical Brodmann's areas and five dorsoventral levels of the thalamus were assessed. Results: Compared to normal subjects, schizophrenia patients lacked significant thalamic gray matter volume correlations with the prefrontal and medial temporal cortical regions in the right hemisphere, and with frontal, cingulate, posterior parietal and occipital regions in the left hemisphere, while normal white matter volume cortical-thalamic correlations along the cingulate gyrus and in the temporal lobe were not found in schizophrenia patients in both hemispheres. In contrast to both normal comparison subjects and good-outcome group, schizophrenia patients with poor outcomes showed significant bilateral gray matter volume correlations between the dorsal thalamus and ventral prefrontal cortex, while the group differences in the white matter volume correlations were mostly restricted to the cingulate arch. Conclusions: Whereas patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficiencies in cortical-thalamic correlational patterns, poor outcome is associated with abnormal interregional correlations not observed in either normal subjects or patients with good outcomes.

In an effort to shed light on the neuroanatomical organization of the PMC, we undertook a study to identify and analyze the thalamocortical connections of these cortices. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in the posterior cingulate (PCC), retrosplenial (RSC), medial parietal cortices (MPC), and posterior cingulate sulcus (PCS), and the labeling patterns within the thalamus were analyzed. Three afferent projection patterns were observed to the PMC from the thalamus: a PCC/RSC pattern that involved the anterior thalamic nuclei, an MPC pattern that involved the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, and a PCS pattern that involved the ventral thalamic nuclei. Additionally, a shared pattern of projections from the anterior intralaminar nuclei (AILN) and posterior thalamic nuclei (PTN) to all cortical regions of the PMC was observed. Our findings suggest that distinct regions within the PMC are supplied by distinctive patterns of thalamic input, but also share common projections from intralaminar and posterior thalamic sources. In addition, we relate our findings to functional abnormalities in aging and dementia, and address a domain-like pattern of thalamocortical labeling of the PMC that is drawn selectively and collectively from multiple thalamic nuclei.;"[Buckwalter, Joseph A.; Parvizi, Josef; Van Hoesen, Gary W.] Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Buckwalter, Joseph A.; Parvizi, Josef; Van Hoesen, Gary W.] Univ Iowa, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Morecraft, Robert J.] Univ S Dakota, Sch Med, Lab Neurol Sci, Div Basic Biomed Sci, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA";"University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of South Dakota";Buckwalter, JA (corresponding author), Univ S Dakota, Ctr Autishm Res, 8110 La Jolla Shores Dr Suite 201, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;jbuckwalter@ucsd.edu;;Buckwalter, Joseph/0000-0001-9758-7255;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 046367, R01 NS046367, R01 NS014944, NS 19632, NS 14944, R56 NS046367, P01 NS019632] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;101;29;30;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

In the course of mapping the dorsal thalamus, we also studied neurons in a subset of thalamic nuclei ( the caudal part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), the oral part of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPLo), the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)) lateral to the MD and just across the internal medullary lamina. We compared these paralaminar neurons to MD neurons by having monkeys perform the same spatial and nonspatial cognitive tasks as those used to investigate the MD; these included two saccadic tasks-one requiring delayed and the other immediate responses-and one picture fixation task. Of the paralaminar thalamic neurons modulated by the saccadic tasks, a majority had saccade-related activity, and this was nearly always spatially tuned. Also, for about half of these neurons, the saccade-related activity occurred exclusively during the delayed-response task. No neurons with event-related activity in the saccadic tasks were preferentially modulated by specific picture stimuli, although other neurons were. All of these results were similar to what we had found for MD neurons. However, in contrast to the high proportion of presaccadic responses observed in the MD, the majority of saccade-related neurons in paralaminar thalamus exhibited mid-or postsaccadic activity, i.e., that started during or after the saccade. Our findings suggest that neurons in the paralaminar thalamus may be possible conduits of oculomotor feedback signals, especially during memory-guided saccades.";"Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Shiga 5202192, Japan; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"Shiga University of Medical Science; Yale University";Tanibuchi, I (corresponding author), Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Shiga 5202192, Japan.;buchi@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp;;;NIMH NIH HHS [MH-38546] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;34;24;24;0;3;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.";"[Bakouie, F.; Gharibzadeh, S.] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Inst Cognit & Brain Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Towhidkhah, F.] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Cybernet & Modeling Biol Syst Lab, Biomed Engn Fac, Tehran, Iran";"Shahid Beheshti University; Amirkabir University of Technology";Gharibzadeh, S (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Inst Cognit & Brain Sci, Tehran, Iran.;"f_bakouie@sbu.ac.ir; gharibzadeh@aut.ac.ir";Towhidkhah, Farzad/M-3911-2018;"Towhidkhah, Farzad/0000-0002-6977-5029; Towhidkhah, Farzad/0000-0003-3135-9609; gharibzadeh, shahriar/0000-0002-9604-8433";Iran National Science Foundation (INSF);Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF));This study was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF).;;21;1;1;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0090-2977;1573-9007;;NEUROPHYSIOLOGY+;Neurophysiology;OCT;2014;46;5;;;;;391;397;;10.1007/s11062-015-9463-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11062-015-9463-8;;;7;"Neurosciences; Physiology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology";AZ6UQ;;Green Submitted;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000348356400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Disease-triggered pathological processes in the basal ganglia can compromise any of these pathways either directly or indirectly, yet the effects of basal ganglia lesioning on its thalamic afferent-receiving territories has not been studied in primates. Two GABA(A) receptor ligands, [H-3]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, were used to study the distribution and binding properties of the receptor in intact monkeys, those with kainic acid lesions in the globus pallidus, and those with ibotenic acid lesions in the reticular nucleus using quantitative autoradiographic technique on cryostat sections of fresh frozen brain tissue. In control monkeys the binding affinities for [H-3]muscimol averaged 50 nM in the thalamic nuclei and 86 nM in the basal ganglia while the binding densities varied (maximum density of binding sites [Bmax] range of 99.4-1000.1 fmol/mg of tissue). Binding affinities and Bmax values for [H-3]flunitrazepam averaged 2.02 nM and 81-113 fmol/mg of tissue, respectively. Addition of 100-muM GABA increased average affinity to 1.35 nM whereas Bmax values increased anywhere from 1-50% in different nuclei. Zolpidem (100 nM) decreased binding by 68-80%. Bmax values for both ligands were decreased at the two survival times in both medial and lateral globus pallidus implying involvement of both nuclei in the lesion. Statistically significant, 40% decrease (P=0.055) of Bmax for [H-3]muscimol was observed in the ventral anterior nucleus pars densicellularis (VAdc, the main pallidal projection territory in the thalamus) 1 week after globus pallidus lesioning and a 36% decrease (P=0.017) 4 months post-lesioning. In contrast, [H-3]flunitrazepam Bmax values in the VAdc of the same animals were increased by 23% (P=0.021) at 1 week and 28% (P=0.005) 4 months postlesion, respectively. One week after the reticular nucleus lesioning, the binding densities of [H-3]muscimol and [H-3]flunitrazepam were decreased in the thalamic nuclei receiving projections from the lesioned reticular nucleus sector by approximately 50% (P<0.05) and 10-33% (P<0.05), respectively. The results suggest that different GABAA receptor subtypes are associated with different GABAergic systems in the thalamus which react differently to deafferentation. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Thalamocortical neurons in most of these nuclei are modulated by the affective and cognitive signals which funnel through the basal ganglia. We review how PFC-connected thalamic nuclei likely contribute to all aspects of cognitive control: from the processing of information on internal states and goals, facilitating its interactions with mnemonic information and learned values of stimuli and actions, to their influence on high-level cognitive processes, attentional allocation and goaldirected behavior. This includes contributions to transformations such as rule-to-choice (parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus), value-to-choice (magnocellular mediodorsal nucleus), mnemonic-to-choice (anteromedial nucleus) and sensory-to-choice (medial pulvinar). Common mechanisms appear to be thalamic modulation of cortical gain and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. The anatomy also implies a unique role for medial PFC in modulating processing in thalamocortical circuits involving other orbital and lateral PFC regions. We further discuss how cortico-basal ganglia circuits may provide a mechanism through which PFC controls cortico-cortical functional connectivity.;"[Phillips, Jessica M.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Mohanta, Sounak; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, 1202 Capitol Ct, Madison, WI 53715 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";"Phillips, JM (corresponding author), Brogden Bldg 619,1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Brogden Bldg 518,1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.";"jphillips7@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Mohanta, Sounak/0000-0001-8169-446X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698; Phillips, Jessica M/0000-0002-8240-7327";"National Institutes of Health [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [201732]; Whitehall Foundation [2015-12-71]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation [23017]; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center pilot grant; National Science Foundation Growing Convergence Research [2021011]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); Whitehall Foundation; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center pilot grant; National Science Foundation Growing Convergence Research";"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation [201732]; the Whitehall Foundation [2015-12-71]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation [23017]; Wisconsin National Primate Research Center pilot grant; and National Science Foundation Growing Convergence Research [2021011].";;345;11;11;1;18;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0149-7634;1873-7528;;NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R;Neurosci.

In this paper this issue is addressed by investigating the connectivity pattern of a brain structure with many, well characterized structural connections, namely the thalamus. Diffusion-weighted and resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected in a group of 38 healthy participants. Probabilistic tractography was performed to parcellate the thalamus into regions structurally connected to different cortical areas. The resulting regions were used as seeds for seed-based analysis of RS fMRI data. The tractographic parcellation was thus cross-validated against functional connectivity data by evaluating the overlap between the functional and structural thalamo-cortical connections originating from the parcellated regions. Our data show only a partial overall correspondence between structural and functional connections, in the same group of healthy individuals, thus suggesting that the two approaches provide complementary and not overlapping information. Future studies are warranted to extend the results we obtained in the thalamus to other structures, and to confirm that the mechanisms behind functional connectivity are more complex than just expressing structural connectivity.;"[Mastropasqua, Chiara; Bozzali, Marco; Spano, Barbara; Cercignani, Mara] Santa Lucia Fdn, Neuroimaging Lab, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Rome, Italy; [Mastropasqua, Chiara] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Brain Ctr Neurosci, Trieste, Italy; [Koch, Giacomo] Santa Lucia Fdn, Dept Clin & Behav Neurol, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Rome, Italy; [Koch, Giacomo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Neurosci, Rome, Italy; [Koch, Giacomo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Neurosci, Stroke Unit, Rome, Italy; [Cercignani, Mara] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Clin Imaging Sci Ctr, Brighton, E Sussex, England";"IRCCS Santa Lucia; University of Trieste; IRCCS Santa Lucia; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Brighton; University of Sussex";Mastropasqua, C (corresponding author), Santa Lucia Fdn, Neuroimaging Lab, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, Rome, Italy.;c.mastropasqua@hsantalucia.it;"Spano', Barbara/K-9535-2016; Spano', Barbara/AAG-1671-2021; Bozzali, Marco/AAC-1031-2022; Mastropasqua, Chiara/AAA-7415-2019; KOCH, Giacomo/IQS-0156-2023";"Spano', Barbara/0000-0002-5291-0984; Spano', Barbara/0000-0002-5291-0984; Bozzali, Marco/0000-0002-0568-2026; Cercignani, Mara/0000-0002-4550-2456; KOch, Giacomo/0000-0001-6155-9439";Italian Ministry of Health;Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy);The Neuroimaging Laboratory is supported in part by grants from the Italian Ministry of Health.;;34;12;12;0;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0896-0267;1573-6792;;BRAIN TOPOGR;Brain Topogr.;JUL;2015;28;4;;;;;548;558;;10.1007/s10548-014-0422-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-014-0422-2;;;11;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;CK8WX;25549779;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000356521700003;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to investigate the functional connectivity of the thalamus in youth with ADHD, using both anatomically and functionally defined thalamic seed regions. Methods:Resting-state functional MRIs obtained from the publicly available ADHD-200 database were analyzed. Thalamic seed regions were defined functionally and anatomically based on Yeo's 7 resting-state-network parcellation atlas and the AAL3 atlas, respectively. Functional connectivity maps of the thalamus were extracted, and thalamocortical functional connectivity was compared between youth with and without ADHD. Results:Using the functionally defined seeds, significant group differences in thalamocortical functional connectivity and significant negative correlations between thalamocortical connectivity and ADHD symptom severity were observed within the boundaries of corresponding large-scale networks. However, in the analysis using the anatomically defined thalamic seeds, significant group differences in connectivity and significant positive correlations were observed outside the expected boundaries of major anatomic projections. The thalamocortical connectivity originating from the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus was significantly correlated with age in youth with ADHD. Limitations:The small sample size and smaller proportion of girls were limiting factors. Conclusion:Thalamocortical functional connectivity based on the intrinsic network architecture of the brain appears to be clinically relevant in ADHD. The positive association between thalamocortical functional connectivity and ADHD symptom severity may represent a compensatory process recruiting an alternative neural network.;"[Hong, Soon-Beom] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, Div Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Hong, Soon-Beom] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Human Behav Med, Med Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Hong, Soon-Beom] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, Div Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Coll Med, 103 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea";"Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU)";Hong, SB (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Psychiat, Div Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Coll Med, 103 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea.;hsbmdmore@hanmail.net;;;;;;;49;0;0;2;2;CMA-CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOC;OTTAWA;1867 ALTA VISTA DR, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1G 5W8, CANADA;1180-4882;1488-2434;;J PSYCHIATR NEUROSCI;J.

Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([H-3]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA-VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA-VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits.;Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA;University of Rochester;Haber, SN (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;suzanne_haber@urmc.rochester.edu;McFarland, Nikolaus R/I-4209-2017;McFarland, Nikolaus R/0000-0002-8699-8857;"NIMH NIH HHS [F31 MH011661, MH11661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS022511, NS22511] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;64;334;342;0;12;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. Modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant in the rodent thalamus. We show that dopaminergic axons profusely target the human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype ( tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). The dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. We also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. The origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. We propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Investigating this thalamic dopaminergic system should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.";Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;Autonomous University of Madrid;Cavada, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, C Arzobispo Marcillo S-N, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.;carmen.cavada@uam.es;"García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/HTO-1533-2023; Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/K-4737-2019; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; García-Cabezas, Miguel Ángel/0000-0003-0534-5182; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Rico, Beatriz/0000-0002-0581-851X";;;;;53;217;220;1;18;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Cortical areas of the supratemporal plane were delineated in Macaca fuscata (M. fuscata) by immunocytochemical staining for parvalbumin, staining for cytochrome oxidase, examination of cyto- and myeloarchitecture, and retrograde tracing of corticocortical connections. Comparative observations were made on Macaca fascicularis (M. fascicularis). Differential staining of fiber plexuses, probably of thalamic origin, identifies a central core zone of dense immunostaining and a surrounding zone of moderate-to-dense immunostaining composed of anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields. Outside the second zone, there is a third anterolateral zone of weaker immunoreactivity, and, outside that zone, there is a fourth zone in which immunoreactivity is virtually absent. Differences in parvalbumin immunostaining in the auditory fields may reflect differences in relative contributions of thalamic inputs from parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells in the medial geniculate complex. The central core zone and the surrounding three fields can be correlated with major auditory fields previously defined by multiunit mapping and thalamocortical connectivity. The core zone contains a large principal field and an anterior extension, The pattern of corticocortical connections between these and adjoining fields suggests that the anteromedial, lateral, and posteromedial fields represent first steps in three streams of connections passing outward from auditory into association cortex. M. fuscata has an unusually large auditory cortex that is more deeply placed in the lateral sulcus in comparison to that of M. fascicularis. A small annectant gyrus provides a guide to the position of the primary auditory area.

Nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were found in the periphery of the contralateral integument compartment of the VB complex. Thus, they formed a shell at the perimeter of this compartment with a somatotopic organization. The compartment consisted of large parts of nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc). NS neurons were located more caudally than WDR neurons. In the NS zone of VPM, the forehead was represented caudally, and oral structures rostrally. In the ventral NS zone of VPM, there was a sequential representation of the tongue, gum and mandibular skin from the medial to the lateral edge. The hand was represented medially in the NS zone of VPLc, and its representation dominated in the rostral NS zone. There was a sequential representation of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudal segments mediolaterally along the dorsal VPLc. In the medial half of ventral NS zone of VPLc, the upper body half was represented, and in the lateral half, the lower body half. The foot was represented at or near the medial edge of lateral half.

According to Hassler, this area includes ventro-oralis posterior (Vop) and ventral intermedius (Vim) nuclei, although some investigators believe that Vop is associated with the pallidothalamic pathway. We sought to correlate our experimental data on distribution of nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents to the monkey thalamus with Hassler's motor thalamic parcelations. We concluded that Hassler's parcelations retained their value, although some adjustments were needed to relate them to the current neuroanatomic data; particularly, the cerebellothalamic zone that represents the monkey ventral lateral nucleus (VL) corresponds topographically to Hassler's Vop, Vim, and most of Voi. Electron microscopic tracing studies have shown very complex circuitry in this region of the monkey thalamus, as the cerebellar and cortical afferents innervating it are engaged in complex synapses with thalamocortical projection neurons, and this interaction is strongly modulated by local circuit neurons and the input from the reticular thalamic nucleus, which are both inhibitory and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic. Spinothalamic afferents also reach the VL. but this input is less studied in the monkey. The circuitry subserving the activity of thalamocortical projection neurons in the VL should be considered while interpreting the functional data obtained in stereotactic surgery.

Recent work in macaques suggests that the thalamus conveys corollary discharge information of upcoming saccades passing from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye field. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the thalamus in humans by assessing the effect of thalamic lesions on the processing of corollary discharge information. Thirteen patients with selective thalamic lesions and 13 healthy age-matched control subjects performed a saccadic double-step task in which retino-spatial dissonance was induced, i.e. the retinal vector of the second target and the movement vector of the second saccade were different. Thus, the subjects could not rely on retinal information alone, but had to use corollary discharge information to correctly perform the second saccade. The amplitudes of first and second saccades were significantly smaller in patients than in controls. Five thalamic lesion patients showed unilateral deficits in using corollary discharge information, as revealed by asymmetries compared with the other patients and controls. Three patients with lateral thalamic lesions including the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) were impaired contralaterally to the side of damage and one patient with a lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) was impaired ipsilaterally to the lesion. The largest asymmetry was found in a patient with a bilateral thalamic lesion.

The vestibular sensors in the inner ear detect self-motion and in turn send projections via the vestibular nuclei to multiple cortical areas through 2 principal thalamocortical pathways, 1 anterior and 1 posterior. While the anterior pathway has been extensively studied, the role of the posterior pathway is not well understood. Accordingly, here we recorded responses from individual neurons in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus of macaque monkeys during externally applied (passive) and actively generated self-motion. The sensory responses of neurons that robustly encoded passive rotations and translations were canceled during comparable voluntary movement (similar to 80% reduction). Moreover, when both passive and active self-motion were experienced simultaneously, neurons selectively encoded the detailed time course of the passive component. To examine the mechanism underlying the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active motion, we experimentally controlled correspondence between intended and actual head movement. We found that suppression only occurred if the actual sensory consequences of motion matched the motor-based expectation. Together, our findings demonstrate that the posterior thalamocortical vestibular pathway selectively encodes unexpected motion, thereby providing a neural correlate for ensuring perceptual stability during active versus externally generated motion.;"[Dale, Alexis; Cullen, Kathleen E.] McGill Univ, Dept Physiol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada";McGill University;Cullen, KE (corresponding author), McIntyre Med Bldg,Room 1219, Montreal, PQ H3G 1Y6, Canada.;kathleen.cullen@mcgill.ca;;;"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health [R01-DC002390, R01-DC009255, R01-DC013069]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research";"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))";The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health (grants R01-DC002390, R01-DC009255, and R01-DC013069 to K.E.C.) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.;;78;22;22;1;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

TrkC-like immunoreactivity was widespread and consisted primarily of varicose fibers. The most dense populations of fibers were in the basal forebrain (in the cholinergic cell groups Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4), in the raphe complex throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and in the locus coeruleus. Other fibers were present in the thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray matter of the midbrain, dorsal midline of the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The only neuronal cell bodies with consistent labeling were located in the lateral hypothalamus. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum showed variable labeling. Specific labeling of varicosities and cell bodies was abolished by omission of the primary antiserum or by preabsorption with the TrkC peptide antigen. We conclude that TrkC-like immunoreactivity can be detected in a wide variety of subcortical locations in the adult rhesus monkey. Labeling was particularly prominent in the vicinity of the major cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic nuclei, known from other studies to be vulnerable in the ageing brain.

Each pathway processes information relevant to directed reaching tasks, but whereas VPLc receives its major input from the spinal cord and external environment, the primary afferent to the pulvinar is cortical. Using combined tracer and thick fixed slice procedures, the some/dendritic morphology of TC neuron populations (with known destination) was shown to be quantitatively similar within VPLc and the pulvinar. This implies that differences in information processing in VPLc (a primary relay) and the pulvinar (an integrative thalamic nucleus) are not defined by a distinctive TC morphology, but rather by the connections of these neuron populations. Two morphologically distinct types of CT axon were observed within the medial pulvinar and VPLc. The more common Type E were fine, had boutons en passant and diffuse terminal bifurcations ending in masses of tiny boutons. Type R axons were thicker, smooth, and terminated in localised clusters of large terminal boutons. Each type had a unique pattern of termination reflecting a distinct action on target neuron populations. The spatial relationship between TC distribution territories and CT terminal fields was examined within the medial pulvinar and VPLc by using anterograde and retrograde tracers injected together within cortical areas 7a, and 3b/1, respectively. Spatial overlap was incomplete within both thalamic nuclei. Our findings show a more complex relationship between TC and CT neuron populations than previously demonstrated.

In the caudorostral dimension, stepwise serial projections convey information through the primary, rostral, and rostrotemporal (AI, R, and RT) core areas on the supratemporal plane, continuing to the rostrotemporal polar area (RTp) and adjacent auditory-related areas of the rostral superior temporal gyrus (STGr) and temporal pole. In addition to this cascade of corticocortical connections, the auditory cortex receives parallel thalamocortical projections from the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Previous studies have examined the projections from MGN to auditory cortex, but most have focused on the caudal core areas AI and R. In this study, we investigated the full extent of connections between MGN and AI, R, RT, RTp, and STGr using retrograde and anterograde anatomical tracers. Both AI and R received nearly 90% of their thalamic inputs from the ventral subdivision of the MGN (MGv; the primary/lemniscal auditory pathway). By contrast, RT received only approximate to 45% from MGv, and an equal share from the dorsal subdivision (MGd). Area RTp received approximate to 25% of its inputs from MGv, but received additional inputs from multisensory areas outside the MGN (30% in RTp vs. 1-5% in core areas). The MGN input to RTp distinguished this rostral extension of auditory cortex from the adjacent auditory-related cortex of the STGr, which received 80% of its thalamic input from multisensory nuclei (primarily medial pulvinar). Anterograde tracers identified complementary descending connections by which highly processed auditory information may modulate thalamocortical inputs.";"[Scott, Brian H.; Saleem, Kadharbatcha S.; Kikuchi, Yukiko; Fukushima, Makoto; Mishkin, Mortimer; Saunders, Richard C.] NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 1B80, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kikuchi, Yukiko] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Sch Med, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Fukushima, Makoto] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Saitama, Japan";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK; RIKEN";Scott, BH (corresponding author), NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 1B80, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;brianscott@mail.nih.gov;Scott, Brian H/G-7932-2012;"Fukushima, Makoto/0000-0002-8809-7892; Kikuchi, Yukiko/0000-0002-0365-0397; Scott, Brian/0000-0003-3949-9737";Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH [ZIA MH001101];Division of Intramural Research Programs, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH;Supported by: Division of Intramural Research Programs grant ZIA MH001101, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH.;;87;12;12;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two alpha-, two beta- and one gamma- or delta-subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits alpha 1, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were found in all layers, alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, all three beta-subunits, gamma 2, and delta. Subunits alpha 3 and alpha 5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2, and delta were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2, whereas alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 1, and gamma 2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, and delta, and in the central amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit alpha 3-IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.;"[Sperk, Guenther; Kirchmair, Elke; Drexel, Meinrad] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Pharmacol, Peter Mayr Str 1a, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Bakker, Jaco] Biomed Primate Res Ctr, Div Vet Care, Dept Anim Sci, Rijswijk, Netherlands; [Sieghart, Werner] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, Dept Mol Neurosci, Vienna, Austria; [Kondova, Ivanela] Biomed Primate Res Ctr, Anim Sci Dept, Div Pathol & Microbiol, Rijswijk, Netherlands";"Medical University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Vienna";Sperk, G (corresponding author), Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Pharmacol, Peter Mayr Str 1a, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;guenther.sperk@i-med.ac.at;"Bakker, Jaco/AGZ-0463-2022; Sieghart, Werner/A-4877-2013";"Bakker, Jaco/0000-0001-6670-1887; Sperk, Guenther/0000-0001-6561-8360; Sieghart, Werner/0000-0002-0443-0302; Drexel, Meinrad/0000-0002-2705-9673";Austrian Science Fund [P 19464, P 26680];Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF));Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Numbers: P 19464, P 26680;;42;15;15;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

To detail these interactions better, the present study used retrograde tracers to reveal the origins of the corticothalamic projections in two closely related monkey species (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis). The medial dorsal thalamic nucleus received only light cortical inputs, which predominantly arose from area 23. Efferents to the anterior medial thalamic nucleus also arose principally from area 23, but these projections proved more numerous than those to the medial dorsal nucleus and also involved additional inputs from areas 29 and 30. The anterior ventral and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei had similar sources of inputs from the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. For both nuclei, the densest projections arose from areas 29 and 30, with numbers of thalamic inputs often decreasing when going dorsal from area 23a to 23c and to area 31. In all cases, the corticothalamic projections almost always arose from the deepest cortical layer. The different profiles of inputs to the anterior medial and anterior ventral thalamic nuclei reinforce other anatomical and electrophysiological findings suggesting that these adjacent thalamic nuclei serve different, but complementary, functions supporting memory. While the lack of retrosplenial connections singled out the medial dorsal nucleus, the very similar connection patterns shown by the anterior ventral and laterodorsal nuclei point to common roles in cognition.;"[Aggleton, John P.; Wright, Nicholas F.; Vann, Seralynne D.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Saunders, Richard C.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, 70 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;Aggleton@cf.ac.uk;"Wright, Nicholas/HHY-7227-2022; Wright, Nick G/O-1092-2013; Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010";"Wright, Nicholas/0000-0003-0798-333X; Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773; Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308";Wolfson Research Merit Award;Wolfson Research Merit Award(Royal Society);This research received support from a Wolfson Research Merit Award.;;77;25;25;0;9;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

To characterize the pathways and types of signals supplied to cortex, we recorded responses to rotational and/or translational stimuli in the macaque thalamus. Few cells responded to rotation alone, with most showing convergence between semicircular canal and otolith signals. During sinusoidal rotation, thalamic responses lead head velocity by similar to 30 degrees on average at frequencies between 0.01-4 Hz. During translation, neurons encoded combinations of linear acceleration and velocity. In general, thalamic responses were similar to those recorded in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei using identical testing paradigms, but differed from those of vestibular afferents. Thalamic responses represented a biased continuum: most cells more strongly encoded translation and fewer cells modulated primarily in response to net gravitoinertial acceleration. Responsive neurons were scattered within a large area that included regions of the ventral posterior and ventral lateral nuclei, and so were not restricted to the known vestibular nuclei projection zones. To determine the origins of these responses, a retrograde tracer was injected into a dorsolateral thalamic site where rotation/translation-sensitive cells were encountered. This injection labeled neurons in the rostral contralateral anterior interposed and fastigial nuclei, but did not label cells within the vestibular nuclei. Examination of thalamic terminations after tracer injections into the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei indicated that most vestibular responsive units fall within the thalamic terminal zones of these nuclei. Thus, vestibular signals, which are supplied to the thalamus from both vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, are positioned for distribution to widespread cortical areas.;"[Meng, Hui; Dickman, J.

The aim of this study was to establish whether information about force, velocity or duration of movement is encoded in cerebellar thalamic discharge and could therefore be involved in the modulation of motor cortical activity. Extracellular single cell recordings were made from the cerebellar thalamus (66 neurones) and VPLc (49 neurotics) of four conscious macaques performing simple wrist movements with various load and gain conditions imposed. A significant correlation (Spearman's; P < 0.05) was found between movement duration and the duration of neuronal discharge of most cerebellar thalamic neurones (65%), the velocity of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of some cerebellar thalamic neurotics (23%), but not between force of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of any cerebellar thalamic neurones. Similar relationships were found between the activity of VPLc neurones and these movement parameters. The strength of the correlations increased when many cells were grouped and analysed as an ensemble, suggesting that populations of cerebellar thalamic (and VPLc) neurones can encode a signal with higher fidelity than single neurones alone. The ensemble data confirmed that the most robust association was between the duration of neuronal discharge and movement duration. We propose that the cerebellum does not provide the motor cortex with specific information about movement force or velocity, but rather that its major role is in activating many motor cortical regions for a specific duration, thus influencing the timing of complex movements involving many muscles and joints.

Here, we demonstrate by combined retrograde tracing and immunocytochemistry that at least some of these are pulvinocortical relay neurons, and further report several distinctive features. First, in contrast with non-giant relay neurons, the giant neurons are often solitary and isolated from a main projection focus. The question thus arises of whether their cortical projections may be non-reciprocal or otherwise distinctive. Second, these neurons are positive for GluR4; but third, they are otherwise neurochemically heterogeneous, in that about one-third are positive for both parvalbumin (PV) and CB. Presumably, these subpopulations are also functionally heterogeneous. These results provide further evidence for the idea of multiple, interleaved organizations within the pulvinar; and they imply that thalamocortical projections are more disparate than has yet been appreciated. Finally, we found that giant CB+ neurons have a distinctive meshwork of large, PV+ terminations, prominent at the first dendritic branch point. In size and location, these resemble inhibitory terminations from the zona incerta or anterior pretectal nucleus (APT), as recently described in higher order thalamic nuclei in rats. One can speculate that giant neurons in the macaque pulvinar participate in a layer 5-APT-thalamus (giant neuron) extrareticular pathway, functionally distinct from the layer 6-reticular nucleus-thalamus network.";"[Imura, Kosuke; Rockland, Kathleen S.] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Rockland, Kathleen S.] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Saitama, Japan";"RIKEN; Saitama University";Rockland, KS (corresponding author), RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;rockland@brain.riken.jp;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;RIKEN Brain Science Institute;RIKEN Brain Science Institute;We thank Elena Borra for assistance with Figure 1, Hiromi Mashiko and Yoshiko Abe for expert assistance with histology, Michiko Fujisawa for assistance with manuscript preparation, and members of the Lab for Cortical Organization and Systematics for discussion and general cooperation.

The long held view that the thalamus serves as a simple hi fidelity relay station for sensory information to the cortex, however, has over recent years been dispelled. Indeed, multiple projections from the vestibular nuclei to thalamic nuclei (including the ventrobasal nuclei, and the geniculate bodies)regions typically associated with other modalities-have been described. Further, some thalamic neurons have been shown to respond to stimuli presented from across sensory modalities. For example, neurons in the rat anterodorsal and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus respond to visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and somatosensory stimuli and integrate this information to compute heading within the environment. Together, these findings imply that the thalamus serves crucial integrative functions, at least in regard to vestibular processing, beyond that imparted by a simple relay. In this mini review we outline the vestibular inputs to the thalamus and provide some clinical context for vestibular interactions in the thalamus. We then focus on how vestibular inputs interact with other sensory systems and discuss the multisensory integration properties of the thalamus.;"[Wijesinghe, Rajiv; Camp, Aaron J.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Biomed Sci, Sydney Med Sch, Sensory Syst & Integrat Lab, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Protti, Dario A.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Physiol, Sydney Med Sch, Vis Lab, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";"University of Sydney; University of Sydney";Camp, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Discipline Biomed Sci, Sydney Med Sch, Sensory Syst & Integrat Lab, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;aaron.camp@sydney.edu.au;;Wijesinghe, Rajiv/0000-0002-6215-6719;Support of the Garnett Passe and Rodney Williams Memorial Foundation;Support of the Garnett Passe and Rodney Williams Memorial Foundation;The authors would also like to acknowledge The Support of the Garnett Passe and Rodney Williams Memorial Foundation.;;68;45;48;3;8;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5110;;;FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT;Front.

Here we report on the distribution of response modalities to 487 intraoperative thalamic stimulations performed in 24 neurogenic pain (NP), 17 parkinsonian (PD) and 10 neuropsychiatric (Npsy) patients. Threshold responses were subdivided into somatosensory, motor and affective, and compared between medial (central lateral nucleus) and lateral (ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral medial) thalamic nuclei and between patients groups. Major findings were as follows: in the medial thalamus, evoked responses were for a large majority (95%) somatosensory in NP patients, 47% were motor in PD patients, and 54% affective in Npsy patients. In the lateral thalamus, a much higher proportion of somatosensory (83%) than motor responses (5%) was evoked in NP patients, while the proportion was reversed in PD patients (69% motor vs. 21% somatosensory). These results provide the first evidence for functional cross-modal changes in lateral and medial thalamic nuclei in response to intraoperative stimulations in different functional disorders. This extensive functional reorganization sheds new light on wide-range plasticity in the adult human thalamocortical system. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For light microscopic analysis small biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or biocytin injections were placed in midrostral and dorsal portions of inferior parietal lobule (IPL), respectively. The distribution anterograde and retrograde labeling was charted, and representative axons and terminal fields were reconstructed in the sagittal plane to examine their features. Two types of fibers were identified-those of thin diameter forming diffuse terminal fields with small boutons, and thick fibers forming focal terminal fields with large boutons. Area PFG injection of BDA resulted in labeling of both types of fibers in LP, MD, and pulvinar, whereas only fibers of the first type were found in VL. Biocytin injection in area Opt resulted in preferential labeling of large fibers terminating in LP and pulvinar. Further electron microscopic analysis of labeled boutons in VL and LP, following a large wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase injection in the middle of IPL, confirmed the existence of small and large corticothalamic boutons and their different termination sites: the small boutons formed synapses on distal dendrites while the large boutons were found close to somata of thalamocortical projection neurons, on the dendrites of local circuit neurons and in complex synaptic arrangements, such as glomeruli. The results demonstrate that projections from small loci of the PPC to functionally and connectionally different thalamic nuclei differ anatomically, implying a different functional impact on these diverse targets.

Each radiotracer is a propylsulfonamide-containing benzamide and was labeled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18. [C-11]CMPyPB was synthesized by the alkylation of a 3-hydroxypyridine precursor using [C-11]MeI, and [F-18]MK-6577 was synthesized by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction using a 2-chloropyridine precursor. Each tracer shows good uptake into rhesus monkey brain with the expected distribution of highest uptake in the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum and lower uptake in the striatum and gray matter of the frontal cortex. In vivo blockade and chase studies of [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal and reversible binding. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal in both rhesus monkey and human brain slices and a distribution consistent with the in vivo results and those reported in the literature. In vivo metabolism studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that only more-polar metabolites are formed for each tracer.

We investigated whether the organization of the thalamocortical (TC) systems for different modalities partly overlap, representing an anatomical support for multisensory and sensorimotor interplay in thalamus. In 2 macaque monkeys, 6 neuroanatomical tracers were injected in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex (PE/PEa in area 5), and dorsal and ventral premotor cortical areas (PMd, PMv), demonstrating the existence of overlapping territories of thalamic projections to areas of different modalities (sensory and motor). TC projections, distinct from the ones arising from specific unimodal sensory nuclei, were observed from motor thalamus to PE/PEa or auditory cortex and from sensory thalamus to PMd/PMv. The central lateral nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus project to all injected areas, but the most significant overlap across modalities was found in the medial pulvinar nucleus. The present results demonstrate the presence of thalamic territories integrating different sensory modalities with motor attributes.

To this purpose, restricted injections of neuronal tracers were made into areas F3, F6, F2, and F7 after physiological identification of the injection sites. The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. The main inputs to F3 [supplementary motor area properly defined (SMA-proper)] originate in the nuclei ventral lateral, pars oralis (VLo), ventral posterior lateral, pars oralis (VPLo), and ventral lateral, pars caudalis (VLc) as well as in caudal parts of the VPLo and VLc (VPLo/VLc complex). F6 (pre-SMA) is mainly the target of nucleus ventral anterior, pars parvocellularis (VApc), and area X of Olszewski. The input to F2 originates mainly in the VPLo/VLc complex, in VLc, and in VLo. The dorsal part of F7 (supplementary eye field) mainly receives from area X, VApc, and nucleus ventral anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc), whereas the ventral F7 is connected with VApc, area X, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). It is concluded that each cortical area is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia circuits. F3 and F2 are targets of the so-called ''motor'' basal ganglia circuit and a cerebellar circuit originating in dorsorostral sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. In contrast, F6 and ventral F7 receive a basal ganglia input mainly from the so-called ''complex'' circuit and a cerebellar input originating in the ventrocaudal sectors of dentate and interpositus nuclei. Finally, with respect to the rest of F7, dorsal F7 also receives a basal ganglia input from the ''oculomotor circuit.''

Despite the pervasive role of the midline thalamus in cognition and disease, there is a limited understanding of its function in humans, likely due to the absence of a rigorous noninvasive neuroimaging methodology to identify its location. Here, we introduce a new method for identifying the midline thalamus in vivo using probabilistic tractography and k-means clustering with diffusion weighted imaging data. This approach clusters thalamic voxels based on data-driven cortical and subcortical connectivity profiles and then segments the midline thalamus according to anatomical connectivity tracer studies in rodents and macaques. Results from two different diffusion weighted imaging sets, including adult data (22-35 years) from the Human Connectome Project (n = 127) and adolescent data (9-14 years) collected at Florida International University (n = 34) showed that this approach reliably classifies midline thalamic clusters. As expected, these clusters were most evident along the dorsal/ventral extent of the third ventricle and were primarily connected to the agranular medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), nucleus accumbens, and medial temporal lobe regions. The midline thalamus was then bisected based on a human brain atlas into a dorsal midline thalamic cluster (paraventricular and paratenial nuclei) and a ventral midline thalamic cluster (rhomboid and reuniens nuclei). This anatomical connectivity-based identification of the midline thalamus offers the opportunity for necessary investigation of this region in vivo in the human brain and how it relates to cognitive functions in humans, and to psychiatric and neurological disorders.;"[Reeders, Puck C.; Nunez, M.

Anterograde and retrograde labeling patterns in the thalamus were charted and individual labeled axons traced in continuous serial sections. Both anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus was extensive, spanning several millimeters mediolaterally and including ventral lateral, ventral anterior, centromedian, and centrolateral nuclei. Paracentral, mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and medial pulvinar nuclei were also labeled. Two basic types of corticothalamic axons were identified: small to medium-width, type 1 axons that formed large terminal fields with small boutons, and thick, type 2 axons that formed small terminal fields with large boutons. Within each group, subtypes were identified based on specific features of the axons and terminals: two subtypes of type 1 axons and four subtypes of type 2 axons. The results revealed multiple modes of corticothalamic connectivity: sparsely distributed type I axons, dense plexuses of type 1 axons, type 2 axon terminal fields either singly or in clusters, and mixed plexuses of type 1 and type 2 axons. Only some cells in the plexuses were retrogradely labeled; some plexuses did not contain any labeled neurons, and many retrogradely labeled neurons were in the regions devoid of anterograde labeling. These connectivity patterns differed between thalamic nuclei. The results revealed much more complex relationships between M1 and thalamus than were previously thought to exist. It is suggested that this connectivity is neither of exclusively a feedback nature nor perfectly reciprocal but is subserved by a multitude of channels, most likely originating from different populations of cortical neurons, and feeding into a variety of functionally different neuronal networks, with each processing specific information.

However, the mechanisms through which these therapeutic benefits are mediated remain poorly understood. Although the regulatory role of mGluR5 on glutamatergic transmission has been examined in various basal ganglia nuclei, very little is known about the localization and function of mGluR5 in the ventral motor and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the main targets of basal ganglia output in mammals. Thus, we used immuno-electron microscopy to map the cellular and subcellular localization of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) in the ventral motor and caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, using double immuno-electron microscopy, we examined the subsynaptic localization of mGluR5 in relation to cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Four major conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, mGluR1a and mGluR5 are expressed postsynaptically on the plasma membrane of dendrites of projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving regions of the ventral motor thalamus and in CM. Second, the plasma membrane-bound mGluR5 immunoreactivity is preferentially expressed perisynaptically at the edges of cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Third, the mGluR5 immunoreactivity is more strongly expressed in the lateral than the medial tiers of CM, suggesting a preferential association with thalamocortical over thalamostriatal neurons in the primate CM. Overall, mGluR5 is located to subserve powerful modulatory role of cortical and subcortical glutamatergic transmission in the primate ventral motor thalamus and CM.;"[Masilamoni, Gunasingh Jeyaraj; Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Masilamoni, Gunasingh Jeyaraj; Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Udall Ctr Excellence Parkinsons Dis, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA";"Emory University; Emory University; Emory University";"Masilamoni, GJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.;Masilamoni, GJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Udall Ctr Excellence Parkinsons Dis, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.";gjeyara@emory.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [P50NS098685]; NIH/ORIP base Grant [P51OD011132]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH/ORIP base Grant";This work was supported by the UDALL Center of Excellence Grant from the National Institutes of Health (P50NS098685 to YS) and the NIH/ORIP base Grant to the Yerkes Primate Center (P51OD011132).;;141;2;2;1;8;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

It is centrally placed on a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network connecting the primary motor cortex, to the dentate nucleus of the contralateral cerebellum through the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT). The VIM is not readily visible on conventional MR imaging, so identifying the surgical target traditionally involved indirect targeting that relies on atlas-defined coordinates. Unfortunately, this approach does not fully account for individual variability and requires surgery to be performed with the patient awake to allow for intraoperative targeting confirmation. The aim of this study is to identify the VIM and the DRT using probabilistic tractography in patients that will undergo thalamic DBS for tremor. Four male patients with tremor dominant PD and five patients (three female) with ET underwent high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) (128 diffusion directions, 1.5mm isotropic voxels and b value = 1500) preoperatively. Patients received VIM-DBS using an MR image guided and MR image verified approach with indirect targeting. Postoperatively, using parallel Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) processing, thalamic areas with the highest diffusion connectivity to the primary motor area (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory area (S1) and contralateral dentate nucleus were identified. Additionally, volume of tissue activation (VTA) corresponding to active DBS contacts were modelled. Response to treatment was defined as 40% reduction in the total Fahn-Tolosa-Martin Tremor Rating Score (FTMTRS) with DBS-ON, one year from surgery. Three out of nine patients had a suboptimal, long-term response to treatment. The segmented thalamic areas corresponded well to anatomically known counterparts in the ventrolateral (VL) and ventroposterior (VP) thalamus. The dentate-thalamic area, lay within the M1-thalamic area in a ventral and lateral location. Streamlines corresponding to the DRT connected M1 to the contralateral dentate nucleus via the dentate-thalamic area, clearly crossing the midline in the mesencephalon. Good response was seen when the active contact VTA was in the thalamic area with highest connectivity to the contralateral dentate nucleus. Non-responders had active contact VTAs outside the dentate-thalamic area.

Various nomenclatures have been proposed to subdivide the motor thalamus, none of which are universally accepted. Both thalamic lesions and high-frequency stimulation ameliorate tremor in diverse pathological conditions. Modern neurophysiological techniques have allowed the recording of the activity of thalamic neurons in patients with different clinical conditions. This has provided a better understanding of the functions of the motor thalamus in humans.

Biochemical studies have shown the presence of adrenaline or its biosynthetic enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, in the rat and human thalamus. However, the distribution of the adrenergic fibres in the thalamus has only been demonstrated in rats. We study the adrenergic innervation of the macaque monkey thalamus using immunohistochemistry against phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase. The distribution of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive fibres is markedly heterogeneous and principally restricted to those nuclei, or their portions, that are located in or close to the midline, with the highest density being found in the paraventricular, parafascicular and mediodorsal nuclei. The paraventricular nucleus is densely innervated by adrenergic axons throughout, while the densest innervation of the parafascicular nucleus is located in its medial part and the strongest mediodorsal nuclear immunolabelling is found in its most posterior and medial region. Moderate or low concentrations of phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunopositive fibres are present in the paratenial nucleus, and all parts of the central nucleus, nucleus reuniens, central medial nucleus, centromedian nucleus, medial geniculate body and medial pulvinar nucleus, while only scattered immunoreactive axons are found in other thalamic nuclei. The morphology of the phenyletanolamine-N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive axons is quite diverse, as they have different diameters and most are endowed with diversely-shaped varicosities. These findings are the first morphological evidence for the presence of adrenergic innervation in the primate thalamus and reveal that this innervation is highly selective, heterogeneous and more widely distributed in primates than in rats. The thalamic nuclei innervated by adrenaline are connected to widespread limbic and associative cortical areas as well as to subcortical structures, in particular the neostriatum and amygdala. We hypothesize that thalamic adrenaline may be implicated in emotional, social and attentional mechanisms through its facilitation of co-ordinated action by these brain regions. (C) 1998 IBRO.

The accumulated burden of inorganic mercury (IHg) within these same cell types has been determined by autometallographic methods. Four groups of monkeys were exposed to methylmercury (MeHg; 50 mu g Hg/kg body weight/day) by mouth for 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, or 12 months followed by 6 months without exposure (clearance group). Neurons, oligodendrocytes, endothelia, and pericytes did not show a significant change in cell number for any exposure group. Astrocyte cell number exhibited a significant decline for both the 6 month and clearance exposure groups. The microglia, in contrast, showed a significant increase in the 18 month and clearance exposure groups. Results from mercury speciation and quantification ana lysis of contralateral matched samples from the thalamus of the right side of the brain from these same monkeys indicated that MeHg concentrations plateaued at around 72 months exposure, whereas the inorganic levels, presumably derived from demethylation of MeHg, continued to increase throughout all exposure durations. Autometallographic determination of the distribution of IHg by cell type indicates that both the astrocytes and microglia contain substantially elevated IHg deposits relative to all other cell types. The data suggest that the inorganic mercury present in the brains, accumulating after long-term subclinical methyl mercury exposure, may be a proximate toxic form of mercury responsible for the changes within the astrocyte and microglial populations.

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

Using simultaneous intracortical and intrathalamic recordings, we demonstrate here that the thalamic deactivation occurring at sleep onset most often precedes that of the cortex by several minutes, whereas reactivation of both structures during awakening is synchronized. Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep. Thus, asynchronous thalamocortical deactivation while falling asleep probably explains the production of hypnagogic hallucinations by a still-activated cortex and the common self-over estimation of the time needed to fall asleep.;"[Magnin, Michel; Bastuji, Helene; Mauguiere, Francois; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, U879, F-69677 Bron, France; [Magnin, Michel; Bastuji, Helene; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Univ Lyon 1, F-69000 Lyon, France; [Rey, Marc] Hop Enfants La Timone, CHU Timone, Serv Neurophysiol Clin, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Bastuji, Helene; Mauguiere, Francois] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonct & Epileptol, F-69677 Bron, France; [Guillemant, Philippe] Univ Aix Marseille 1, Inst Univ Syst Therm Ind, F-13453 Marseille, France";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite";Magnin, M (corresponding author), Inst Natl Sante & Rech Med, U879, F-69677 Bron, France.;michel.magnin@univ-lyon1.fr;mauguiere, frederic a l/C-6383-2013;"mauguiere, frederic a l/0000-0002-9150-8584; BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707; Garcia-Larrea, Luis/0000-0002-9873-789X; MAUGUIERE, Francois/0000-0003-4291-4727";;;;;49;141;144;0;17;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Lesions of the anterior thalamus in macaques produce impairments which resemble those seen after lesions of the fornix-mamillary pathway, which carries projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus, while lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, which receives inputs from frontal and temporal cortex, produce moderate impairments on a wider range of memory tasks. In the present study, we have made bilateral excitotoxic lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus, or both, in marmoset monkeys. Monkeys with lesions of both thalamic nuclei were severely impaired on retention and new learning of examples of the visuospatial conditional task, a task which is specifically impaired by lesions of the fornix or hippocampus. They were not impaired on performance of a visuovisual conditional task on which monkeys with hippocampal lesions are impaired, nor were they impaired on any visual discrimination task, including the concurrent discrimination task on which monkeys with temporal neocortical ablations are impaired. Monkeys with separate lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus were not impaired on any of these tasks. These results suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus and the anterior thalamus are both involved in processing the output of the hippocampal-fornix-thalamic circuit. Dense amnesia may result from damage to circuits additional to the temporal lobe efferents to either the anterior or the mediodorsal nuclei. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While Aggleton and Brown (1999) suggested a role for recognition and not recall, Van der Werf et al. (2003) suggested that this nucleus is functionally related to executive function and strategic retrieval, based on its connections to the prefrontal cortices (PFC). The present study used a lesion approach including patients with focal thalamic lesions to examine the functions of the MD, the intralaminar nuclei and the midline nuclei in memory processing. A newly designed pair association task was used, which allowed the assessment of recognition and cued recall performance. Volume loss in thalamic nuclei was estimated as a predictor for alterations in memory performance. Patients performed poorer than healthy controls on recognition accuracy and cued recall. Furthermore, patients responded slower than controls specifically on recognition trials followed by successful cued recall of the paired associate. Reduced recall of picture pairs and increased response times during recognition followed by cued recall covaried with the volume loss in the parvocellular MD. This pattern suggests a role of this thalamic region in recall and thus recollection, which does not fit the framework proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). The functional specialization of the parvocellular MD accords with its connectivity to the dorsolateral PFC, highlighting the role of this thalamocortical network in explicit memory (Van der Werf et al., 2003).

The main sources of thalamocortical inputs to the auditory cortex are the medial geniculate complex (MGC), medial pulvinar (PM), and several adjoining nuclei in the posterior thalamus. The distribution of inputs varies topographically by cortical area and thalamic nucleus, but in a manner that has not been fully characterized in primates. In this study, the thalamocortical connections of the lateral belt and parabelt were determined by placing retrograde tracer injections into various areas of these regions in the marmoset monkey. Both regions received projections from the medial (MGm) and posterodorsal (MGpd) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC); however, labeled cells in the anterodorsal (MGad) division were present only from injections into the caudal belt. Thalamic inputs to the lateral belt appeared to come mainly from the MGC, whereas the parabelt also received a strong projection from the PM, consistent with its position as a later stage of auditory cortical processing. The results of this study also indicate that the organization of the marmoset auditory cortex is similar to other primates. Anat Rec, 2012.

In two awake, juvenile male Macaca fascicularis monkeys, microstimulation was applied in ventralis anterior (VA), ventralis lateralis (VL), or ventralis posterior lateralis (VPL) of the thalamus. Thalamic recording was used to identify the region that contained pallidal-receiving (PR) thalamic neurons, cells that responded orthodromically to stimulation in the internal pallidal segment (GPi). Thalamic stimulation was used to elicit motor responses. Penetrations in the thalamus and the pallidum focused on areas with activity related to contralateral arm movement. Fifty one PR cells were identified electrophysiologically in VL oralis (VLo), VL caudalis (VLc) and VA pars parvocellularis (VApc). 2. With a subject at rest, trains of stimuli were applied through the thalamic microelectrode. Palpable or visible muscle twitches or joint movements were evoked by short trains (12 pulses) of stimuli applied in VLc and VPL oralis (VPLo); thresholds there ranged from 5 to 75 mu A. In VA and VLo, areas where PR neurons were located, even longer trains (24 pulses) of stimuli with currents up to 200 mu A usually failed to evoke movement. In the caudal portions of VLo, near VPLo, there were some microexcitable sites found near PR cells where stimuli at similar to 50 mu A elicited movement. 3. From microstimulation studies combined with histological reconstruction, Ashe and co-workers hypothesized that microexcitable zones were cerebellar receiving areas (CR) and nonexcitable zones were PR areas. Our data support theirs and add electrophysiological identification of PR areas. Further, we injected wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the thalamus at one of the more rostral microexcitable sites, just caudal and lateral to identified PR cells. The tetra-methyl benzidine-reacted HRP label was found in the contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but not in ipsilateral GPi, showing that even this rostral microexcitable zone was a CR area. 4. Together with evidence from the literature, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that PR cells have relatively weak access to spinal-destined motor outputs, whereas thalamocortical neurons from VPLo and VLc have more secure access. In addition to characteristics of cell discharge and responses to somatosensory stimulation, microexcitability may be a further aid in tentative electrophysiological identification of PR versus CR areas of the motor thalamus without necessarily recording thalamic neuronal responses to stimulation in GPi or the DCN.";"UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT PHYSIOL & BIOPHYS, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT REHABIL MED, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV WASHINGTON, REG PRIMATE RES CTR, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";;;Buford, John A/B-4413-2011;Buford, John A/0000-0001-6464-2617;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00166] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-07097, NS-15017] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;72;28;30;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Severity of deficits and the degree of recovery have been associated with widespread network dysfunction, yet it is not clear how these behavioural and functional brain changes relate with the underlying structural white matter tracts. Here, we investigated whether recovery after unilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions was associated with changes in white matter microstructure across large-scale frontoparietal cortical and thalamocortical networks. Diffusion-weighted imaging was acquired in four male rhesus macaques at pre-lesion, week 1, and week 8-16 post-lesion when target selection deficits largely recovered. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct cortical frontoparietal fiber tracts, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and transcallosal fibers connecting the PFC or posterior parietal cortex (PPC), as well as thalamocortical fiber tracts connecting the PFC and PPC to thalamic nuclei. We found that the two animals with small PFC lesions showed increased fractional anisotropy in both cortical and thalamocortical fiber tracts when behaviour had recovered. However, we found that fractional anisotropy decreased in cortical frontoparietal tracts after larger PFC lesions yet increased in some thalamocortical tracts at the time of behavioural recovery. These findings indicate that behavioural recovery after small PFC lesions may be supported by both cortical and subcortical areas, whereas larger PFC lesions may have induced widespread structural damage and hindered compensatory remodeling in the cortical frontoparietal network.;"[Adam, Ramina; Everling, Stefan] Univ Western Ontario, Grad Program Neurosci, London, ON, Canada; [Adam, Ramina; Menon, Ravi S.; Everling, Stefan] Univ Western Ontario, Robarts Res Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Adam, Ramina; Johnston, Kevin; Menon, Ravi S.; Everling, Stefan] Univ Western Ontario, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Schaeffer, David J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Johnston, Kevin; Everling, Stefan] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, London, ON, Canada; [Menon, Ravi S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Med Biophys, London, ON, Canada";"Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario)";Everling, S (corresponding author), Robarts Res Inst, Ctr Funct & Metab Mapping, 1151 Richmond St North, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.;severlin@uwo.ca;"Johnston, Kevin/U-4453-2018; Menon, Ravi S/K-5500-2013; Menon, Ravi/GQY-7621-2022";"Menon, Ravi S/0000-0002-7916-0263; Menon, Ravi/0000-0002-7916-0263; Everling, Stefan/0000-0001-9714-9757; Johnston, Kevin/0000-0001-9481-6251";"Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant [FRN148365]; Canada First Research Excellence Fund; Brain Canada; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Canada Graduate Scholarship-Master's (CGS-M)";"Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canada First Research Excellence Fund; Brain Canada; Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Canada Graduate Scholarship-Master's (CGS-M)";This research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant FRN148365 to S.E., the Canada First Research Excellence Fund to BrainsCAN, and Brain Canada to R.S.M.

However, injections in the motor area resulted in retrograde and anterograde labelling of nuclei in both the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus. These nuclei included the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the intralaminar nuclei (ILN), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and midline nuclei. Large unilateral injections located mainly laterally in the thalamus labelled cells, contralaterally, in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus but never in VL, ILN and MD. The present results confirm previously described bilateral thalamocortical projections from the VL to the somatosensorimotor area in this species (Regidor and Divac, Brain Behav. Evol., 39, 265 - 269, 1992) and in addition demonstrate that (i) bilateral thalamocortical projections are established preferentially with the motor area, (ii) several nuclei are involved in such connections, (iii) these connections are reciprocal and topographically organized, and (iv) labelling in the contralateral thalamus observed in the present study is not a result of transneuronal transport of the tracer through thalamothalamic connections. This organization is unique among mammals and supports previous anatomical and electrophysiological findings, on the basis of which it has been suggested that the hedgehog retains a primitive character in neocortical and thalamic evolution.;;;DINOPOULOS, A (corresponding author), UNIV THESSALONIKI,SCH VET MED,DEPT ANAT,GR-54006 THESSALONIKI,GREECE.;;;;;;;;46;6;7;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Here, we describe the thalamic projections to two of these areas (V6 and V6A), based on 14 retrograde neuronal tracer injections in 11 hemispheres of 9 Macaca fascicularis. The injections were placed either by direct visualisation or using electrophysiological guidance, and the location of injection sites was determined post mortem based on cyto- and myeloarchitectural criteria. We found that the majority of the thalamic afferents to the visual area V6 originate in subdivisions of the lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei, with weaker inputs originating from the central densocellular, paracentral, lateral posterior, lateral geniculate, ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei. In contrast, injections in both the dorsal and ventral parts of the visuomotor area V6A revealed strong inputs from the lateral posterior and medial pulvinar nuclei, as well as smaller inputs from the ventrolateral complex and from the central densocellular, paracentral, and mediodorsal nuclei. These projection patterns are in line with the functional properties of injected areas: dorsal stream extrastriate area V6 receives information from visuotopically organised subdivisions of the thalamus; whereas visuomotor area V6A, which is involved in the sensory guidance of arm movement, receives its primary afferents from thalamic nuclei that provide high-order somatic and visual input.";"[Gamberini, Michela; Bakola, Sophia; Passarelli, Lauretta; Fattori, Patrizia; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Pharm & Biotechnol, Piazza Porta S Donato 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bakola, Sophia; Burman, Kathleen J.; Rosa, Marcello G.

Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus.;"[Galvan, Adriana; Hu, Xing; Smith, Yoland; Wichmann, Thomas] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Galvan, Adriana; Smith, Yoland; Wichmann, Thomas] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA";"Emory University; Emory University";Galvan, A (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.;agalvan@emory.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P51-OD011132]; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center) [P50-NS071669, GR01-NS083386]";"National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center)";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (Grant P51-OD011132 to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center), NIH/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS Udall Center Grant P50-NS071669 and Grant GR01-NS083386 to T.W.).

Thalamocortical inputs arise in parallel from four divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), which have regionally distinct projection patterns. These inputs terminate in layers IIIb and/or IV, and are assumed to be glutamatergic, although this has not been verified. In the present study, immunoreactivity (-ir) for the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2, was used to estimate the regional and laminar distribution of the glutamatergic thalamocortical projection in the macaque auditory cortex. Coronal sections containing auditory cortex were processed for VGluT2 and other markers concentrated in the thalamorecipient layers: cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and parvalbumin. Marker expression was studied with wide field and confocal microscopy. The main findings were: (1) VGkuT2-ir was highest in the core, intermediate in the belt, and sparse in the parabelt; (2) VGluT2-ir was concentrated in the neuropil of layers IIIb/IV in the core and layer IIIb in the belt; (3) VGluT2-ir matched regional and laminar expression of the other chemoarchitectonic markers. The results indicate that the glutamatergic thalamic projection to auditory cortex, as indexed by VGluT-2-ir, varies along the core-belt-parabelt axis in a manner that matches the gradients of other markers. These chemoarchitectonic features are likely to subserve regional differences in neuronal activity between regions of auditory cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Human transcripts were used for the synthesis of alpha(2), alpha(4), beta(2), beta(3), gamma(1) and delta subunit messenger RNA probes. Rat complementary DNAs were used for generating alpha(1), alpha(3), beta(1) and gamma(2) subunit messenger RNA probes. Nigral, pallidal and cerebellar afferent territories in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei all expressed alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(4), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3), delta and gamma(2) subunit messenger RNAs but at different levels. Each intralaminar nucleus displayed its own unique expression pattern. In the thalamus, gamma(1) subunit messenger RNA was detected only in the parafascicular nucleus. Comparison of the expression patterns with the known organization of GABA(A) connections in thalamic nuclei suggests that (i) the composition of the receptor associated with reticulothalamic synapses, except for those in the intralaminar nuclei, may be alpha(1) alpha(4) beta(2) delta, (ii) receptors of various other subunit compositions may operate in the local GABAergic circuits, and (iii) the composition of receptors at nigro- and pallidothalamic synapses may differ, with those at nigrothalamic probably containing beta(1) and gamma(2) subunits. In the medial and lateral parts of the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticularis, the alpha(1) beta(2) and gamma(2) messenger RNAs were co-expressed at a high level suggesting that this subunit composition was associated with all GABAergic synapses in the direct and indirect striatal output pathways. Various other subunit messenger RNAs were also expressed but at a lower level. In the substantia nigra pars compacta the most highly expressed messenger RNAs were alpha(3), alpha(4) and beta(3); all other subunit messenger RNAs studied, except for gamma(1), alpha(1) and alpha(2), were expressed at a moderate to high level. In the striatum, the following subunit messenger RNAs were expressed (listed in order of decreasing signal intensity): alpha(4), beta(3), alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(2), delta, gamma(2), alpha(1). The expression patterns found in the monkey were similar to those described in comparable nuclei in the rat by Wisden et al. [J. Neurosci. (1992), 12, p. 1040]; however, the monkey nuclei displayed a much greater variety of GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs. (C) 1998 IBRO.

In order to further test these differences, we used electrical stimulation to map the ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei of the thalamus in three ketamine anaesthetised monkeys. Movements were readily evoked from VL at currents of down to 10 mu A. The movements were typically multijoint, and stimulation could evoke arm and trunk or arm and facial movement at the same current threshold. Evoked arm movements often involved multiple joints, with or without finger movements. Facial movements included the lips, tongue, jaw, eyebrows and, occasionally, the eyes. The thalamic map was topographic, but complex with at least two separate regions related to arm movement. Very few sites within the VA could stimulate movement, even at high currents. We therefore suggest that the cerebellar projections to motor regions of the cortex, which pass through the VL thalamic nuclei, have a different relationship and are closer to movement execution than the projections from basal ganglia via the ventro-anterior nucleus.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England";University of Oxford;Miall, RC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PT, England.;;Miall, R.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the sensorimotor nuclei of the thalamus in humans using task-based fMRI at a field strength of 9.4T by assessing the individual subject-specific sensorimotor BOLD response during a combined active motor (finger-tapping) and passive sensory (tactile-finger) stimulation. We demonstrate that both tasks increase BOLD signal response in the lateral nuclei group (VPL, VA, VLa, and VLp), and in the pulvinar nuclei group (PuA, PuM, and PuL). Finger-tapping stimuli evokes a stronger BOLD response compared to the tactile stimuli, and additionally engages the intralaminar nuclei group (CM and Pf). In addition, our results demonstrate reproducible thalamic nuclei activation during motor and tactile stimuli. This work provides important insight into understanding the function of individual thalamic nuclei in processing various input signals and corroborates the benefits of using ultra-high-field MR scanners for functional imaging of fine-scale deeply located brain structures.;"[Charyasz, Edyta; Heule, Rahel; Erb, Michael; Scheffler, Klaus] Univ Tubingen, Dept Biomed Magnet Resonance, Tubingen, Germany; [Charyasz, Edyta; Heule, Rahel; Molla, Francesko; Erb, Michael; Kumar, Vinod Jangir; Grodd, Wolfgang; Scheffler, Klaus; Bause, Jonas] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept High Field Magnet Resonance, Tubingen, Germany; [Charyasz, Edyta; Molla, Francesko] Grad Training Ctr Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Heule, Rahel] Univ Childrens Hosp, Ctr MR Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Molla, Francesko] Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Ctr Neurol, Tubingen, Germany";"Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; University Children's Hospital Zurich; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital";"Charyasz, E (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Biomed Magnet Resonance, Tubingen, Germany.;Charyasz, E (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept High Field Magnet Resonance, Tubingen, Germany.;Charyasz, E (corresponding author), Grad Training Ctr Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany.";edyta.charyasz@tuebingen.mpg.de;;Heule, Rahel/0000-0002-4589-6483;"DFG [SCHE 658/12, SCHE 658/17]; BMBF [01GQ1805A]";"DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))";Funding This work was supported by DFG (grant numbers: SCHE 658/12 and SCHE 658/17) and BMBF (grant number: 01GQ1805A).;;56;0;0;1;1;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-453X;;FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ;Front.

Changes in the activity of thalamic neurons receiving input from the basal ganglia or the cerebellum were examined in two models of Parkinson's disease, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys. Metabolic activity of the neurons was evaluated at the cellular level by quantitative in situ hybridization, using the expression of messenger RNA for subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (COI), encoded by the mitochondrial genome, as the marker. COI mRNA expression decreased significantly in thalamocortical neurons receiving input from the substantia nigra (-50.6%) or the cerebellum (-45%) in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats compared with controls. The decrease was observed in all thalamic neurons whether or not they were retrogradely labelled with a tracer injected into the motor cortex. Similarly, COI mRNA expression decreased in projection neurons and interneurons of the thalamus receiving input from the substantia nigra (-39 and -38%, respectively), the internal pallidum (-20 and -42.4%, respectively) and the cerebellum (-36.2 and -50%, respectively) of MPTP-treated monkeys compared with controls. These decreases in COI mRNA levels show that nigrostriatal denervation results in a decrease in the metabolic activity of thalamic neurons in the territories innervated by the substantia nigra, pallidum and cerebellum, which in turn is indicative of a decrease in their neuronal activity. The decrease did not concern the entire thalamus, however, since metabolic activity was unchanged in two thalamic nuclei considered to be limbic structures, the laterodorsal nucleus in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and the anterior nucleus in MPTP-treated monkeys. Hypoactivity of both the basal ganglia-thalamic and cerebellar-thalamic pathways might therefore be implicated in the development of parkinsonian symptoms.;"Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, UMR679, F-75013 Paris, France; Univ Paris 06, Fac Med, Paris, France; INSERM, UMR679, Paris, France; Univ Murcia, Sch Med, Dept Human Anat & Psychobiol, Murcia, Spain";"Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); University of Murcia";Francois, C (corresponding author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, UMR679, 47 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.;cfrancoi@ccr.jussieu.fr;"Hirsch, Etienne/AAC-7655-2019; MARTINEZ, VIRGINIA GM GARCIA/C-6313-2017";"Hirsch, Etienne/0000-0003-4823-276X; Rolland, Anne-Sophie/0000-0001-7888-9354; HERRERO, MARIA TRINIDAD/0000-0003-4953-1446";;;;;70;59;60;0;12;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;JAN;2007;130;;1;;;;265;275;;10.1093/brain/awl337;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awl337;;;11;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;120CP;17148469;Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000243061500024;View Full Record in Web of Science

We provide novel evidence for neurochemical and synaptic specificity of two complementary circuits linking one such system, the prefrontal cortex with the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus in primates. One circuit originated from the neurochemical group of parvalbumin-positive thalamic neurons and projected focally through large terminals to the middle cortical layers, resembling 'drivers' in sensory pathways. Parvalbumin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by small 'modulatory' type cortical terminals, forming asymmetric (presumed excitatory) synapses at thalamic sites enriched with the specialized metabotropic glutamate receptors. A second circuit had a complementary organization: it originated from the neurochemical group of calbindin-positive thalamic neurons and terminated through small 'modulatory' terminals over long distances in the superficial prefrontal layers. Calbindin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by prefrontal axons through small and large terminals that formed asymmetric synapses preferentially at sites with ionotropic glutamate receptors, consistent with a driving pathway. The largely parallel thalamo-cortical pathways terminated among distinct and laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons that differ markedly in inhibitory control. The balance of activation of these parallel circuits that link a high-order association cortex with the thalamus may allow shifts to different states of consciousness, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.;"[Zikopoulos, Basilis; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832; Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104";"NIMH; NINDS";"NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";Supported by NIH grants from NIMH and NINDS.

Summary of Review-Thalamic nuclei are composed of 5 major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions. Posterior choroidal lesions result in visual field deficits, variable sensory loss, weakness, dystonia, tremors, and occasionally amnesia and language impairment. Conclusions-These vascular syndromes reflect the reciprocal cerebral cortical-thalamic connections that have been interrupted and provide insights into the functional properties of the thalamus.";Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, VBK 915, Boston, MA 02114 USA;"Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";Schmahmann, JD (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, VBK 915, Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;jschmahmann@partners.org;Schmahmann, Jeremy/ABF-1215-2021;Schmahmann, Jeremy/0000-0003-0706-5125;;;;;140;489;512;0;24;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0039-2499;1524-4628;;STROKE;Stroke;SEP;2003;34;9;;;;;2264;2278;;10.1161/01.STR.0000087786.38997.9E;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.STR.0000087786.38997.9E;;;15;"Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology";718FW;12933968;Green Submitted, Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000185135300056;View Full Record in Web of Science

Glutamatergic inputs to these cells arise predominantly from corticothalamic (in both basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving ventral motor thalamic territories; BGMT and CBMT, respectively) and cerebellothalamic terminals (in CBMT). In Parkinson's disease patients and animal models, neuronal activity is abnormal within both BGMT and CBMT. Historically, such motor thalamic dysregulation has been largely attributed to changes in inhibitory tone from the basal ganglia output nuclei, ignoring the potential role of other thalamic inputs in such processes, particularly within the CBMT, which is largely devoid of direct basal ganglia afferents. We have recently reported changes in the abundance and structural morphology of corticothalamic terminals in BGMT of parkinsonian monkeys. In this study, we assessed potential changes in the prevalence of cortical (vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive, vGluT1-positive) and subcortical (vGluT2-positive) glutamatergic inputs in contact with GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CBMT of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. Our findings revealed that interneurons represent a major target of both sets of glutamatergic terminals. In both BGMT and CBMT of control and parkinsonian monkeys, 29%-38% of total asymmetric axodendritic synapses (putative glutamatergic) were formed by vGluT1-positive terminals and 11%-17% of total vGluT1-positive terminals targeted dendrites of GABAergic interneurons. In CBMT, 16%-18% of asymmetric synaptic inputs on interneurons involved vGluT2-containing terminals. No major differences in the extent of glutamatergic innervation of thalamic GABAergic interneurons were found between control and parkinsonian monkeys.";"[Albaugh, Daniel L.; Huang, Christina; Ye, Sherry; Pare, Jean-Francois; Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neuropharmacol & Neurol Disorders, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Albaugh, Daniel L.; Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Udall Ctr Excellence Parkinsons Dis Res, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Smith, Yoland] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA";"Emory University; Emory University; Emory University";Albaugh, DL (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neuropharmacol & Neurol Disorders, 954 Gatewood Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;dalbaugh001@gmail.com;;"Albaugh, Daniel/0000-0001-6642-5448; Ye, Changtian/0000-0002-5381-410X; Huang, Christina/0000-0002-1200-7520";"National Institutes of Health [P51-OD011132]; Parkinson's Foundation [PF-FBS-1928]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [P50-NS098685]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Parkinson's Foundation; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";"National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: P51-OD011132; Parkinson's Foundation, Grant/Award Number: PF-FBS-1928; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Grant/Award Number: P50-NS098685 (Udall Center grant)";;47;5;5;1;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

One likely source is the central thalamus, which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Because the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye position signals arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, because the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye position signals in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye position signals in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye position signals were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye position signals to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that 2 distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye position signals from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye position signals through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks.;Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan;Hokkaido University;Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, North 15,West 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.;masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp;Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011;Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;;;;;55;35;36;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

These connections are organized according to the recently described architectonic parcellation of the STR. The core line regions of the supratemporal plane (STP) project to the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). All regions except the primary auditory area also have projections to additional thalamic nuclei. The rostral STP has strong connections with the caudal part of the ventral subdivision (MGv) of MGN as well as with medial pulvinar (PM). In contrast the primary auditory area projects mainly to rostral MGv. The caudalmost STP projects mainly to the dorsal subdivision (MGd) and to the magnocellular subdivision (MGmc) as well as to the PM and the lateral (PL) and oral (PO) pulvinar, nucleus limitans (Li), and mediodorsal (MD) nucleus. The belt line regions of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) project mainly to the pulvinar but also have projections to MGd and MGmc. Specifically, rostral STG projects to the caudal part of PM, to MGmc, and to the suprageniculate (SG) nucleus, whereas caudal STG projects to the rostral part of PM and to FL, PO, MGd, MGmc, SG-Li and MD nuclei. The root line areas in the circular sulcus of the Sylvian fissure project mainly to MGmc but also to MGd, PM, and SG-Li nuclei. These connections originate mainly from neurons in cortical layer VI, with some from layer Vb. It is suggested that these connections may be involved in different aspects of auditory information processing.

Retrogradely labeled neurons for each injection were related to architectonically defined thalamic nuclei. Nissl, acetylcholinesterase, cytochrome oxidase, myelin, parvalbumin, calbindin, and Cat 301 preparations allowed the ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamic regions, parvocellular and magnocellular subdivisions of ventral anterior nucleus, and anterior and posterior subdivisions of ventral lateral nucleus of monkeys to be identified. The results indicate that each cortical area receives inputs from several thalamic nuclei, but the proportions differ. Ill receives major inputs from the posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus while premotor areas receive major inputs from anterior parts of ventral lateral nucleus (the anterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus and the anterior portion of posterior subdivision of ventral lateral nucleus). PMD and SMA have connections with more dorsal parts of the ventral lateral nucleus than PMV. The results suggest that galagos share many subdivisions of the motor thalamus and thalamocortical connection patterns with simian primates, while having less clearly differentiated subdivisions of the motor thalamus.

Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. Methods: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. Results: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. Conclusion: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGrNs of humans.

The cartographic method relied on the use of intracerebral, ventricular landmarks (CA: anterior commissure and CP: posterior commissure). The basal ganglia outlines, first drawn in transverse sections perpendicular to the CA-CP plane, were reconstructed on the horizontal and midsagittal planes. Maps from several individuals were superimposed and statistical variations studied. The results confirm that the length between the two CA and CP points is statistically greater (7%) in the Macaca mulatta than Macaca fascicularis but reveal considerable inter-individual differences. The closer a given nucleus is from a ventricular reference point, the more stable its outline. Superimpositions led to a statistical determination of the stereotaxic coordinates required to reach a given target center.

Interestingly, in an early stage of brain development, communicative innervations between the dorsal thalamus and telencephalon must pass through the ventral thalamus, the major derivative of which is the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The TRN occupies a striking control position in the brain, sending inhibitory axons back to the thalamus, roughly to the same region where they receive afferents. [Hypotheses]: The present study hypothesizes that the TRN plays a pivotal role in dynamic attention by controlling thalamocortical synchronization. The TRN is thus viewed as a functional networking filter to regulate conscious perception, which is possibly embedded in thalamocortical networks. Based on the anatomical structures and connections, modality-specific sectors of the TRN and the thalamus appear to be responsible for modality-specific perceptual representation. Furthermore, the coarsely overlapped topographic maps of the TRN appear to be associated with cross-modal or unitary conscious awareness. Throughout the latticework structure of the TRN, conscious perception could be accomplished and elaborated through accumulating intercommunicative processing across the first-order input signal and the higher-order signals from its functionally associated cortices. As the higher-order relay signals run cumulatively through the relevant thalamocortical loops, conscious awareness becomes more refined and sophisticated. [Conclusions]: I propose that the thalamocortical integrative communication across first- and higher-order information circuits and repeated feedback looping may account for our conscious awareness. This TRNmodulation hypothesis for conscious awareness provides a comprehensive rationale regarding previously reported psychological phenomena and neurological symptoms such as blindsight, neglect, the priming effect, the threshold/duration problem, and TRN-impairment resembling coma. This hypothesis can be tested by neurosurgical investigations of thalamocortical loops via the TRN, while simultaneously evaluating the degree to which conscious perception depends on the severity of impairment in a TRN-modulated network.;Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA;"Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard Medical School";Min, BK (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;minbk@bwh.harvard.edu;Min, Byoung-Kyong/F-3192-2013;Min, Byoung-Kyong/0000-0002-1999-8275;;;;;126;70;74;0;24;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1742-4682;;;THEOR BIOL MED MODEL;Theor.

Here we test this hypothesis using immunohistochemistry against the dopamine transporter (DAT) in adult macaque and rat brains. The extent and density of DAT-immunoreactive (-ir) axons were remarkably greater in the macaque dorsal thalamus, where the mediodorsal association nucleus and the ventral motor nuclei held the densest immunolabeling. In contrast, sparse DAT immunolabeling was present in the rat dorsal thalamus; it was mainly located in the mediodorsal, paraventricular, ventral medial, and ventral lateral nuclei. The reticular nucleus, zona incerta, and lateral habenular nucleus held numerous DAT-ir axons in both species. Ultrastructural analysis in the macaque mediodorsal nucleus revealed that thalamic interneurons are a main postsynaptic target of DAT-ir axons; this suggests that the marked expansion of the dopamine innervation in the primate in comparison to the rodent thalamus may be related to the presence of a sizable interneuron population in primates.

We examined the topography of pulvinar projections to these two cortical regions by placing multiple injections of different tracers (fluorescent dyes, horseradish peroxidase) in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of macaque monkeys. The patterns of label observed after injections in inferotemporal gyrus indicate that area TEO and the ventral part of area V4 receive a major input from the ventral part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLv) while area TE has strong connections with the caudal pole of the medial pulvinar (PuM) and only minor connections with PuLv. In contrast, injections in the caudal inferior parietal cortex demonstrate that area PGc, on the lateral surface of the inferior parietal gyrus, and area POa, in the ventral bank of intraparietal sulcus, receive strong projections from PuM and the adjacent fringe of the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLd). Paired injections of two different tracers in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of the same hemisphere revealed a nearly complete segregation of the two populations of labeled neurons in the pulvinar, with only a small region of overlap in PuM, close to the PuM/PuLd border. These results demonstrate a clear separation of the thalamic afferents to the inferior parietal and inferotemporal cortex which parallels the separation of prestriate afferents to these two cortical territories (Morel & Bullier, 1990).;;;BALEYDIER, C (corresponding author), INSERM, U94, 16 AVE DOYEN LEPINE, F-69500 BRON, FRANCE.;;;;;;;;78;76;76;0;3;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;MAY;1992;8;5;;;;;391;405;;10.1017/S0952523800004922;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800004922;;;15;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";HQ063;1375095;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1992HQ06300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the first investigation that explores the problem by direct comparison, in the same animal, of thalamic zones that 1) project to M1 and SMA and 2) receive cerebellar-nuclear (CN) and pallidal (GP) afferents. These four zones were mapped in two monkeys by means of two retrograde tracers for M1 and SMA injections and of two anterograde tracers for CN and GP injections. All injections were performed under electrophysiological control (microstimulation and multiunit recordings). Injections in cortical areas were restricted to the hand/arm representation; in the SMA, the tracer deposit was within the ''SMA-proper'' (or ''area F3'') and did not include its rostral extension (''pre-SMA'' or ''area F6''). It was found that zones of all four types formed a number of highly complex patches of labeling that were usually not confined to one cytoarchitectonically defined thalamic nucleus. The overlap of clusters of labeled terminals and perikarya was evaluated morphometrically (area measurements) on a number of coronal sections along the anteroposterior extent of the motor thalamus. In line with previous studies, the thalamic territories innervated by CN and GP afferents rarely overlapped. However, zones projecting to M1 and/or to SMA included thalamic regions receiving CN as well as GP projections, providing the first evidence of such overlap from individual animals. The present observations support the previous conclusion from this laboratory (based on transsynaptic labeling) that the SMA receives, apart from its strong pallidal transthalamic input, a CN transthalamic input. These present findings that both M1 and SMA are recipients of transthalamic inputs from GP and CN thus support the concept that a mixed subcortical input consisting of weighted contributions from cerebellum, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and spinothalamic tract is directed to each functional component of the sensorimotor cortex.

The data indicated that the pars principalis of VA (VApc) projected mainly to CN and additionally to Put, and that the pars magnocellularis of VA (VAmc) or pars oralis of VL (VLo) projected selectively to CN or Put, respectively. It was also indicated that CM projected to the middle and caudal parts of Put, while Pf projected to CN and the rostral part of the Put. The data further indicated that the dorsomedial, ventromedial, or lateral part of CM projected respectively to the dorsolateral, ventromedial, or intermediate part of Put, and that the medial or lateral part of Pf projected respectively to the medial or lateral part of the head of CN. Direct projections from STN and PPN to the striatum were confirmed. The subthalamostriatal projections showed a mediolateral topography. The PPN was shown to project bilaterally to the striatum with an ipsilateral predominance.;"KAGOSHIMA UNIV,FAC MED,DEPT ANAT,KAGOSHIMA 890,JAPAN; KYOTO UNIV,FAC MED,DEPT MORPHOL BRAIN SCI,KYOTO 606,JAPAN";"Kagoshima University; Kyoto University";NAKANO, K (corresponding author), MIE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT,TSU,MIE 514,JAPAN.;;;;;;;;56;120;121;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;DEC 24;1990;537;1-2;;;;;54;68;;10.1016/0006-8993(90)90339-D;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(90)90339-D;;;15;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;EP961;1707734;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1990EP96100007;View Full Record in Web of Science

We observed the same 15 distinct architectonic areas in 10 brains. Within the granular, dysgranular, and agranular regions described in prior studies, we identified 4, 4, and 7 distinct areas, respectively. Across brains, these areas have consistent architectonic characteristics, and in flat map reconstructions they display a consistent topological or neighborhood arrangement, despite variations in the size of individual areas between cases. The borders between areas are generally rather sharply defined. Some areas, in particular the dysgranular areas, appear to consistently contain subtle transitions that suggest possible subareas or modules within the well-delimited areas. The presence of a distinct granular area that straddles the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus over its entire posterior-to-anterior extent is consistent with the available evidence on interoceptive thalamocortical projections, and also with the tensile anchor theory of species-specific cortical gyrification. These observations are consonant with the model of homeostatic afferent processing in the primate insula, and they suggest that discrete modules within insular cortex provide the basis for its polymodal integration of all salient activity relevant to ongoing emotional behavior.

Regional net accumulation rate constants were derived from kinetic (two-tissue compartment model with irreversible tracer trapping) and graphic (Patlak) analyses, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input. The kinetic data analysis showed that the rate constant for the transfer of [C-11]HTP into the brain (K-1) was higher than that for [C-11]AMT in the striatum and thalamus but was similar in other brain regions. The rate constant for tracer trapping (k(3)) was also higher for [C-11]HTP than for [C-11]AMT in the striatum (0.046 +/- 0.024 versus 0.019 +/- 0.006 min(-1)) and thalamus (0.039 +/- 0.013 versus 0.016 +/- 0.007 min(-1)). In agreement with previously reported regional HTP accumulation rates, the net accumulation rate constant (K-acc) for [C-11]HTP was also higher in these regions than in other brain regions; this is in contrast to the uniform distribution of [C-11]AMT Kacc values. This suggests that the regional net accumulation rates obtained with these two PET tracers will be of different magnitude, which might be related to the activity of each targeted enzyme.";"Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Biosci, Div Pharmacokinet & Drug Therapy, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Uppsala Hosp, Hosp Pharm, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Uppsala Hosp, Inst Oncol Radiol & Clin Immunol, Sect Radiol, Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Imanet, Uppsala, Sweden";"Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University Hospital; Uppsala University; Uppsala University Hospital";Lundquist, P (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Biosci, Div Pharmacokinet & Drug Therapy, Box 591, SE-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.;pinelopi.lundquist@farmbio.uu.se;;;;;;;47;16;17;0;4;NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP;NEW YORK;75 VARICK STREET, 9TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA;0271-678X;;;J CEREBR BLOOD F MET;J.

Here, we present an approach that combines primate-optimized tissue sectioning and clearing with ultrahigh-speed fluorescence microscopy implementing improved volumetric imaging with synchronized on-the-fly-scan and readout technique, and is capable of completing whole-brain imaging of a rhesus monkey at 1 x 1x 2.5 mu m(3) voxel resolution within 100 h. We also developed a highly efficient method for long-range tracing of sparse axonal fibers in datasets numbering hundreds of terabytes. This pipeline, which we call serial sectioning and clearing, three-dimensional microscopy with semi-automated reconstruction and tracing (SMART), enables effective connectome-scale mapping of large primate brains. With SMART, we were able to construct a cortical projection map of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and identify distinct turning and routing patterns of individual axons in the cortical folds while approaching their arborization destinations.;"[Xu, Fang;

Relating the anatomical connections of PPC to its neurophysiological functions may elucidate the organization of the parietal-frontal network. In owl and squirrel monkeys, long-duration electrical stimulation distinguished several functional zones within the PPC and motor/premotor cortex (M1/PM). Multijoint forelimb movements reminiscent of reach, defense, and grasp behaviors characterized each functional zone. In PPC, functional zones were organized parallel to the lateral sulcus. Thalamocortical connections of PPC and M1/PM zones were investigated with retrograde tracers. After several days of tracer transport, brains were processed, and labeled cells in thalamic nuclei were plotted. All PPC zones received dense inputs from the lateral posterior nucleus and the anterior pulvinar. PPC zones received additional projections from ventral lateral (VL) divisions of motor thalamus, which were also the primary source of input to M1/PM. Projections to PPC from rostral motor thalamus were sparse. Dense projections from ventral posterior (VP) nucleus of somatosensory thalamus distinguished the rostrolateral grasp zone from the other PPC zones.

Here, we describe a set of computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques. Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications. Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through more accurate computational models of DBS.;"[Xiao, YiZi; Zitella, Laura M.; Teplitzky, Benjamin A.; Kastl, Daniel; Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Duchin, Yuval; Adriany, Gregor; Yacoub, Essa; Harel, Noam] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Magnet Resonance Res, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Johnson, Matthew D.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";"Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Biomed Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Inst Translat Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.";john5101@umn.edu;"Yacoub, Essa/AAS-7757-2021; Adriany, Gregor/R-6656-2016; Harel, Noam/R-7391-2018";"Harel, Noam/0000-0002-6034-3801; Adriany, Gregor/0000-0002-6428-9005";"National Institutes of Health [R01-NS081118, R01-NS085188, P41-113015894, P30-076408, U54-MH091657]; National Science Foundation (IGERT) [DGE-1069104, 00006595]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation (IGERT)(National Science Foundation (NSF))";This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01-NS081118, R01-NS085188, P41-113015894, P30-076408, and the Human Connectome Project U54-MH091657) and the National Science Foundation (IGERT DGE-1069104 to LZ and GFRP 00006595 to BT).

How the brain decides the timing of self-initiated movements remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways play this role, but the subcortical signals that determine movement timing have not been identified. The present study reports that a subset of thalamic neurons predicts the timing of self-initiated saccadic eye movements. When monkeys made a saccade in response to the fixation point ( FP) offset in the traditional memory saccade task, neurons in the ventrolateral and the ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus exhibited a gradual buildup of activity that peaked around the most probable time of the FP offset; however, neither the timing nor the magnitude of neuronal activity correlated with saccade latencies, suggesting that the brain is unlikely to have used this information to decide the times of saccades in the traditional memory saccade task. In contrast, when monkeys were required to make a self-timed saccade within a fixed time interval after an external cue, the same neurons again exhibited a strong buildup of activity that preceded saccades by several hundred milliseconds, showing a close correlation between the times of neuronal activity and the times of self-initiated saccades. The results suggest that neurons in the motor thalamus carry subjective time information, which is used by cortical networks to determine the timing of self-initiated saccades.";"Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1020075, Japan";"Hokkaido University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)";Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, North 15,West 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.;masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp;Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011;Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;;;;;48;75;76;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Gerbella et al. (2010) Cereb. Cortex, 20, 141-168], and compared them with those to area 8/FEF (frontal eye field). Both areas 45A and 45B were the targets of highly predominant projections from the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and of additional projections, mostly from the magnocellular ventral anterior and the medial pulvinar nucleus. The projection profiles from different MD subdivisions clearly distinguished these two areas from one another and from area 8/FEF. Area 45A was the target of predominant projections from parvicellular MD and of minor, albeit robust, projections from magnocellular MD. The opposite was true for area 45B: magnocellular MD was the major source of projections and parvicellular MD contributed minor, albeit robust, projections. Furthermore, area 45B, but not area 45A, was targeted by robust projections from multiform MD, the principal thalamic nucleus for area 8/FEF. These results provide further evidence for the distinctiveness of areas 45A and 45B, and support the idea that area 45B is affiliated with the frontal oculomotor system, challenging the proposed homology of this area with part of the human language-related area 45 (rostral part of Broca's region). Furthermore, the present data provide evidence for potentially robust trans-thalamic (via magnocellular MD) afferent, as well as direct and reciprocal, amygdaloid connections of areas 45A and 45B, suggesting the contribution of emotional information to the differential role of these two areas in non-spatial information processing.;"[Baccarini, Matteo; Borra, Elena; Gerbella, Marzio; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, IIT,Unita Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Contini, Massimo] Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Fisiol, Florence, Italy; [Baccarini, Matteo] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Sci Umane, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Florence; University of Ferrara";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, IIT,Unita Parma, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019";"Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618; CONTINI, Massimo/0000-0001-9555-2366";"Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2006052343_002]; Belgian Science Policy Office [IUAP P6/29]";"Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)";"The 3D reconstruction software was developed by CRS4, Pula, Cagliari, Italy.

To aid in functional and structural data analysis, we have created a comprehensive parcellation of the rhesus macaque subcortex using a high-resolution ex vivo structural imaging scan. This anatomical scan and its parcellation were warped to the updated NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2), an in vivo population template, where the parcellation was refined to produce the Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (SARM) with 210 primary regions-of-interest (ROIs). The subcortical parcellation and nomenclature reflect those of the 4th edition of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos et al., in preparation ), rather than proposing yet another novel atlas. The primary ROIs are organized across six spatial hierarchical scales from small, fine-grained ROIs to broader composites of multiple ROIs, making the SARM suitable for analysis at different resolutions and allowing broader labeling of functional signals when more accurate localization is not possible. As an example application of this atlas, we have included a functional localizer for the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus in three macaques using a visual flickering checkerboard stimulus, identifying and quantifying significant fMRI activation in this atlas region. The SARM has been made openly available to the neuroimaging community and can easily be used with common MRI data processing software, such as AFNI, where the atlas has been embedded into the software alongside cortical macaque atlases.;"[Hartig, Renee; Evrard, Henry C.] Univ Tubingen, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Hartig, Renee; Logothetis, Nikos K.; Evrard, Henry C.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany; [Hartig, Renee] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Mannheim, Germany; [Glen, Daniel] NIMH, Sci & Stat Comp Core, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Jung, Benjamin] Brown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Jung, Benjamin; Messinger, Adam] NIMH, Lab Brain & Cognit, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Paxinos, George] Neurosci Res Australia, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia; [Paxinos, George] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia; [Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro, Mexico; [Evrard, Henry C.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Logothetis, Nikos K.; Evrard, Henry C.] Int Ctr Primate Brain Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China";"Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; Central Institute of Mental Health; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Brown University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Neuroscience Research Australia; University of New South Wales Sydney; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research";"Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Tubingen, Germany.;Messinger, A (corresponding author), NIMH, Lab Brain & Cognit, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;Garza-Villarreal, EA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro, Mexico.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Evrard, HC (corresponding author), Int Ctr Primate Brain Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.";"egarza@comunidad.unam.mx; adam.messinger@nih.gov; Henry.Evrard@nki.rfmh.org";"Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo/A-7879-2008; Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019; Glen, Daniel/HCG-8456-2022";"Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo/0000-0003-1381-8648; Jung, Benjamin/0000-0002-8906-8452; Evrard, Henry/0000-0001-8429-4699; Hartig, Renee/0000-0002-7734-8991; Glen, Daniel/0000-0001-8456-5647; Messinger, Adam/0000-0002-8939-7897";"Max Planck Society; Intramural Research Program of the NIMH [ZIA MH002918, ZICMH002888]; NINDS [ZIA MH002918, ZICMH002888]";"Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); Intramural Research Program of the NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";EAGV would like to thank Gabriel A.

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

Advanced imaging techniques have enabled the non-invasive tracing of brain networks to define the human connectome on a millimetre-scale. During early development, the brain undergoes significant changes that are likely represented in the developing connectome, and preterm birth represents a significant environmental risk factor that impacts negatively on early cerebral development. Using tractography to comprehensively map the connections of the thalamocortical unit, we aim to demonstrate that premature extrauterine life due to preterm delivery results in significantly decreased thalamocortical connectivity in the developing human neonate. Methods: T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and 32-direction diffusion tensor images were acquired from 18 healthy term-born neonates (median gestational age: 41(+3)) and 47 preterm infants (median gestational age: 28(+3)) scanned at term-equivalent age. Using a novel processing pipeline for tracing connections in the neonatal brain we map and compare the thalamocortical macro-connectome between groups. Results: We demonstrate that connections between the thalamus and the frontal cortices, supplementary motor areas, occipital lobe and temporal gyri are significantly diminished in preterm infants (FDR-corrected, p < .001). Conclusions: This supports the hypothesis that the thalamocortical system is vulnerable following preterm birth and the tractographic framework presented represents a method for analysing system connectivity that can be readily applied to other populations and neural systems.

Projections from the dopamine-containing cells of the ventral mesencephalon to the prefrontal cortex are also critical for these cognitive abilities. It is unclear, however, whether dopamine axons innervate the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in primates. In order to address this question, we examined the distribution of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus of macaque monkeys. Labeled axons were distributed quite heterogeneously in this nucleus, and did not strictly follow cytoarchitectonic subdivision boundaries. The ventral and lateral portions of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, which include parts of the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions, had the highest density of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons. In contrast, the dorsomedial portion, which included primarily the magnocellular subdivision, had the lowest density of labeled axons. In both lightly and densely innervated portions of the nucleus, small, dense clusters of dopamine transporter-immunoreactive axons were present. Axons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase were distributed in a pattern very similar to that of dopamine transporter-labeled axons. In contrast, noradrenergic axons, as revealed by dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity, were present in higher density and were more evenly distributed throughout the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. This dopamine innervation of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus reveals another possible anatomical substrate through which dopamine may influence the cognitive functions mediated by thalamo-prefrontal circuitry.

Retrograde tracer diamidino yellow (DY), applied directly to the pial surface on rostral or caudal areas of rat M2 (RM2 and CM2, respectively) labeled cells ipsilaterally throughout layers II/III, V, and VII of the adjacent primary motor area and the parietal areas (SI and SH). In addition, retrograde transport labeled contralateral CM2 or RM2 in layers II/III and V at sites homotopic to either CM2 or RM2 application sites. Contralateral layer VII was retrogradely labeled by the application to layer I of CM2, but not by the RM2 application. Retrograde DY transport from layer I of RM2 or CM2 of was seen in the ventral medial (VM), ventral lateral (VL), and posterior (Po) thalamic nuclei. However layer I transport from CM2 additionally labeled the thalamic central medial (CM) nucleus, while the RM2 labeled the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. Upon determination that thalamic nuclei VM and VL were of primary interest in this study, due to their dense retrograde labeling, injections of anterograde tracer rhodamine dextranamine (RDA) into VM or VL were performed in order to study the projection patterns of these nuclei to layer I of the frontal cortex. RDA injections into VM labeled fibers extending through layer I of both RM2 and CM2 and throughout the cingulate cortex. Injections of RDA into VL consistently labeled dense fibers in layer I of both CM2 and RM2, although labeling was sharply decreased anterior to CM2. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that projections to layer I from all sources of cortical input make a significant contribution to integration throughout the neocortex.

However, little is known about protein expression patterns in other areas of the brain. In situ hybridization studies have shown high ErbB4 mRNA levels in various subcortical areas, suggesting that ErbB4 is also expressed in cell types other than cortical interneurons. Here, using highly-specific monoclonal antibodies, we provide the first extensive report of ErbB4 protein expression throughout the cerebrum of primates. We show that ErbB4 immunoreactivity is high in association cortices, intermediate in sensory cortices, and relatively low in motor cortices. The overall immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation is intermediate, but is high in a subset of interneurons. We detected the highest overall immunoreactivity in distinct locations of the ventral hypothalamus, medial habenula, intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and structures of the ventral forebrain, such as the islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum, and medium expression in the reticular thalamic nucleus. While this pattern is generally consistent with ErbB4 mRNA expression data, further investigations are needed to identify the exact cellular and subcellular sources of mRNA and protein expression in these areas. In contrast to in situ hybridization in rodents, we detected only low levels of ErbB4-immunoreactivity in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei but a diffuse pattern of immunofluorescence that was medium in the dorsal striatum and high in the ventral forebrain, suggesting that most ErbB4 protein in dopaminergic neurons could be transported to axons. We conclude that the NRG-ErbB4 signaling pathway can potentially influence many functional systems throughout the brain of primates, and suggest that major sites of action are areas of the corticolimbic network. This interpretation is functionally consistent with the genetic association of NRG1 and ERBB4 with schizophrenia.;"[Neddens, Joerg; Buonanno, Andres] Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Mol Neurobiol Sect, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)";Neddens, J (corresponding author), JSW Life Sci GmbH, Dept Histol, Grambach, Austria.;jneddens@jsw-lifesciences.com;;;Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health;Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));The research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health.

Labeled cells and terminals in the thalamus resulting from the injections were related to architectonic boundaries. As in previous studies in primates, the hand representation of area 3b has dense, restricted projections predominantly from the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus (VPl). Projections to area 1 were highly convergent from several thalamic nuclei including the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), anterior pulvinar (PA), VPl, and the superior division of the ventral posterior nucleus (VPs). In cortex immediately caudal to area 1, what we term area 5, thalamocortical connections were also highly convergent and predominantly from nuclei of the thalamus associated with motor, visual, or somatic processing such as VL, the medial pulvinar (PM), and PA, respectively; with moderate projections from VP, central lateral nucleus (CL), lateral posterior nucleus (LP), and VPs. Finally, thalamocortical connections of area 7b/AIP were from a range of nuclei including PA, PM, LP/LD, VL, CL, PL, and CM. The current data support two conclusions drawn from previous studies in titi monkeys and other primates. First, cortex caudal to area 1 in New World monkeys is more like area 5 than area 2. Second, the presence of thalamic input to area 5 from both motor nuclei and somatosensory nuclei of the thalamus, suggests that area 5 could be considered a highly specialized sensorimotor area.";"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Krubitzer, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;lakrubitzei@ucdavis.edu;;;"NEI NIH HHS [F32 EY014503-01A1] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS35103-07] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;77;11;11;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness.;"[Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Phillips, Jessica M.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Mohanta, Sounak; Andryk, Samantha; Dooley, Gaven L.; Afrasiabi, Mohsen; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Raz, Aeyal] Rambam Hlth Care Campus, Dept Anesthesiol, IL-3109601 Haifa, Israel; [Raz, Aeyal] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53715 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Rambam Health Care Campus; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine";"Redinbaugh, MJ; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53715 USA.";"mredinbaugh@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698; Redinbaugh, Michelle/0000-0003-1367-8606";"NIH [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; BSF [201732]; WNPRC pilot grant";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); WNPRC pilot grant";We thank M.I.

Nonhuman primate studies have highlighted the crucial role of the cerebellum for saccade adaptation, but its neural substrates in humans are poorly understood. Recent physiological experiments suggest that, in addition to cerebellar structures, cortical areas may be involved as well. We have therefore hypothesized that saccade adaptation may rely on a cerebello-cerebral network, in which the cerebellar thalamus may link cerebellar and cerebral structures. To test this hypothesis, we studied saccade adaptation in a group of four patients with a thalamic lesion, with (n=2) or without (n=2) involvement of the cerebellar thalamus. Compared to healthy subjects, saccade adaptation was reduced in patients with associated cerebellar syndrome, but normal in patients without cerebellar syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cerebello-thalamic pathways contribute to saccade adaptation in humans and suggest that the thalamus relays adaptation-related information from the cerebellum to cerebral cortical oculomotor areas.;"Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, F-75651 Paris 13, France; Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Explorat Fonct Syst Nerveux, Paris, France; Humboldt Univ, Charite, Neurol Klin, Berlin, Germany";"Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Gaymard, B (corresponding author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, 47 Bd Hop, F-75651 Paris 13, France.;gaymard@ccr.jussieu.fr;Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013;"Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530; YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X";;;;;53;50;50;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Although it is suggested that this pathway is affected in schizophrenia, there is a lack of functional and structural data regarding its synaptic organization. The scope of this study was to characterize the ultrastructural features of thalamocortical synapses formed by afferents from the MD by applying anterograde tract tracing, immunohistochemical detection of parvalbumin (PV, a probable marker of thalamocortical endings), and quantitative electron microscopic techniques to the PFC of the macaque monkey. Our findings indicate that anterogradely-labeled and PV-immunoreactive boutons exhibit similar ultrastructural properties, characterized by their larger size, higher incidence of release sites and a higher occurrence of mitochondria when compared to non-labeled, excitatory-like endings in the middle layers of the PFC. Although most of the contacts were made on spines in both cases, PV-immunopositive axon terminals apparently targeted dendritic shafts at about twice the frequency found for anterogradely-labeled afferents from the MD (20.5% and 9.5%, respectively). This result suggests diversity among thalamocortical and/or PV-immunoreactive axon terminals of the PFC. In accordance with studies in other cortical areas, our findings suggest that corollary discharge through the mediodorsal thalamocortical projection is also adapted to synaptic transmission with high efficacy and probably exhibits marked short-term temporal dynamics in the PFC.;"Hungarian Acad Sci, United Res Org, Neurobiol Res Grp, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary; Semmelweis Univ, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Semmelweis University; Yale University";Negyessy, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, United Res Org, Neurobiol Res Grp, Tuzolto U 58, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary.;negyessy@ana.sote.hu;"Négyessy, László/C-9632-2012; Négyessy, László/G-6283-2019";Négyessy, László/0000-0002-4369-0406;NIMH NIH HHS [MH38546, MH44866] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;35;24;24;0;4;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Reorganization results in expansion of intact chin inputs, which reactivate neurons in the deafferented hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b), ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. A likely contributing mechanism for this large-scale plasticity is sprouting of axons across the hand-face border. Here we determined whether such sprouting takes place in area 3b. We first determined the extent of intrinsic corticocortical connectivity between the hand and the face representations in normal area 3b. Small amounts of neuroanatomical tracers were injected in these representations close to the electrophysiologically determined hand-face border. Locations of the labeled neurons were mapped with respect to the detailed electrophysiological somatotopic maps and histologically determined hand-face border revealed in sections of the flattened cortex stained for myelin. Results show that intracortical projections across the hand-face border are few. In monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns and expanded chin representation, connections across the hand-face border were not different compared with normal monkeys. Thalamocortical connections from the hand and face representations in the ventroposterior nucleus to area 3b also remained unaltered after injury. The results show that sprouting of intrinsic connections in area 3b or the thalamocortical inputs does not contribute to large-scale cortical plasticity.;"[Chand, Prem; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8,Nainwal Rd, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Government of India [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-I]; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Research Associate Fellowship";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant; National Brain Research Centre; Government of India; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Research Associate Fellowship";"This work was supported by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India Grant BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012 to N.J. and National Brain Research Centre core funds.

This study investigated the morphology of single axons of entopeduncular neurons projecting to the motor thalamus by placing small injections of dextran biotin into the EP and reconstructing drawings of single axone from serial sections. There were two populations of entopeduncular-thalamic projection axone: those that projected only to the motor thalamus (VL and VM) and those that projected to both the motor thalamus and other nuclei (e.g., the habenula). The neurochemistry of EP neurons projecting to the thalamus was investigated by injecting the retrograde tracer FluoroCold into the VL and VM thalamic nuclei to retrogradely fill entopeduncular projection neurons. These were subsequently immunohistochemically labeled for choline acetyl transferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Consistent with previous studies, significant proportions of these neurons were GABA immunoreactive. In addition, approximately half of the entopeduncular-thalamic projecting neurons were found to be cholinergic. This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula.

Although it has been shown that both the cortical and thalamic representations can reorganize, uncertainties exist regarding the extent, nature, and time course of changes at each level. We have determined how cortical representations in the somatosensory area 3b and the ventroposterior ( VP) nucleus of thalamus are affected by long standing unilateral dorsal column lesions at cervical levels in macaque monkeys. In monkeys with recovery periods of 22-23 months, the intact face inputs expanded into the deafferented hand region of area 3b after complete or partial lesions of the dorsal columns. The expansion of the face region could extend all the way medially into the leg and foot representations. In the same monkeys, similar expansions of the face representation take place in the VP nucleus of the thalamus, indicating that both these processing levels undergo similar reorganizations. The receptive fields of the expanded representations were similar in somatosensory cortex and thalamus. In two monkeys, we determined the extent of the brain reorganization immediately after dorsal column lesions. In these monkeys, the deafferented regions of area 3b and the VP nucleus became unresponsive to the peripheral touch immediately after the lesion. No reorganization was seen in the cortex or the VP nucleus. A comparison of the extents of deafferentation across the monkeys shows that even if the dorsal column lesion is partial, preserving most of the hand representation, it is sufficient to induce an expansion of the face representation.;"[Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India; [Jain, Neeraj; Qi, Hui-Xin; Collins, Christine E.; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC); Vanderbilt University";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010;Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850;"National Institutes of Health [NS16446]; Wellcome Trust [063259/Z/00/Z(N.J.)]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant NS16446 ( J.

Data we obtained in one patient after a limited left thalamic infarct bring some new insights into this debate. This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch. vibration. joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities. He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior media (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely. the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological Studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission. while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.

In this study, we characterized the native T-type calcium current underlying thalamic burst responses in the macaque monkey. Current clamp recordings from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) slices showed characteristic burst responses when relay cells were depolarized from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials. These bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of excitatory synaptic inputs to LGN cells. Under voltage clamp conditions, the inactivation kinetics of native currents recorded from primate LGN neurons showed consistency with T-type currents recorded in other mammals and in expression systems. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR performed on RNA isolated from the LGN (including tissues isolated from magnocellular and parvocellular laminae) detected voltage-dependent calcium channel (Ca-v) 3.1, Ca-v 3.2, and Ca-v 3.3 channel transcripts. Ca-v 3.1 occurred at relatively higher expression than other isoforms, consistent with in situ hybridization studies in rats, indicating that the molecular basis for burst firing in thalamocortical systems is an important conserved property of primate physiology. Since thalamic bursts have been observed during visual processing as well as in a number of CNS disorders, studies of the expression and modulation of these currents at multiple levels are critical for understanding their role in vision and for the discovery of new treatments for disruptions of thalamic rhythms.

The German parcellation and terminology has been mostly used for the human thalamus in neurosurgery atlases; the Anglo-American parcellation and terminology is the most used in experimental research on the primate thalamus. In this article, we review the historical development of terminological and parcellation schemes for the primate thalamus over the last 200 years.

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.;"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;s.sherman@sunysb.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY12936, EY11494, EY11409, EY0308] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;98;454;459;3;41;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;;;NEURON;Neuron;JAN 17;2002;33;2;;;;;163;175;;10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00582-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00582-7;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;513PU;11804565;Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000173387700005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Fractional anisotropy reflects the integrity of white matter fibers. Fractional anisotropy of a young adult brain is low in gray matter, high in white matter, and highest in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Thus, we selected the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, head of the caudate nucleus, semioval center, thalamus, and corpus callosum (splenium and genu) as regions of interest when using diffusion-tensor imaging to observe fractional anisotropy of major white matter fiber tracts and the deep gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys aged 4-8 years. Results showed no laterality differences in fractional anisotropy values. Fractional anisotropy values were low in the head of caudate nucleus and thalamus in gray matter. Fractional anisotropy values were highest in the splenium of corpus callosum in the white matter, followed by genu of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy values were lowest in the semioval center and posterior limb of internal capsule. These results suggest that fractional anisotropy values in major white matter fibers and the deep gray matter of 4-8-year-old rhesus monkeys are similar to those of healthy young people.;"[Zhao, Xinxiang; Zhang, Yanglin] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Radiol, Kunming 650101, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China; [Pu, Jun] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Neurosurg, Kunming 650101, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yaodong] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Dept Neurosurg, Kunming 650106, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China; [Niu, Xiaoqun] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Pneumol, Kunming 650101, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China; [Yu, Danping] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Yiwu Hosp, Yiwu 322001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China";"Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University; Zhejiang University";Pu, J (corresponding author), Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Neurosurg, Kunming 650101, Yunnan Province, Peoples R China.;"zhaoxinxiang06@126.com; pujun303@yahoocom.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [30960398, 81260213]; Forty-Seventh Batch of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20100470376]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Forty-Seventh Batch of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)";"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 30960398, 81260213; the Forty-Seventh Batch of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, No. 20100470376";;57;0;0;1;14;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;1673-5374;1876-7958;;NEURAL REGEN RES;Neural Regen.

Ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis (VPLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation on the gyrus. In contrast, Ventralis lateralis pars oralis (VLo) provides the most substantial input to a portion of the hand representation in the sulcus. Prior studies have shown that VPLo is a major site of termination of cerebellar efferents and that VLo is a major site of termination of pallidal efferents. Thus, our results indicate that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum directly influence the hand representation of the primary motor cortex.;"VET ADM MED CTR, RES SERV 151, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT PHYSIOL, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, DEPT NEUROSURG, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA";"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";;;;Holsapple, James/0000-0003-0419-4474;PHS HHS [24328, 843902, 02957] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;69;136;137;0;5;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 mu m(2)) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 mu m(2)), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 mu m(2)) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 mu m(2) and 1.6 mu m(2), respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 mu m of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest.

Each injection resulted in anterograde labeling in the three subdivisions of the ventral anterior nucleus (pars parvicellularis, VApc; pars densicellularis, VAdc; and pars magnocellularis, VAmc) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VL). NRT fibers had beaded shapes and coursed in a posterior direction giving rise to relatively diffuse terminal plexuses. The average size of the beads (0.7 mu m(2)) and their density per 100 mu m of fiber length (23.7-25.7) were similar between the nuclei studied. At the electron microscopic level, anterogradely labeled boutons displayed positive immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and formed relatively long (similar to 0.4 mu m) symmetric synaptic contacts. Usually, a single terminal formed synapses on more than one postsynaptic structure. Synaptic contacts were on projection and local circuit neurons and targeted mainly their distal dendrites. In the VAmc, synapses on local circuit neurons composed 48% of the total sample, in the VAdc/VApc and in the VL the proportion was higher, 65% and 62%, respectively. The results suggest that the input from the anterior pole of the monkey reticular nucleus to the motor-related thalamic nuclei is organized differently from what is known on the organization of connections of NRT with sensory thalamic nuclei in other species in that the terminal fields of individual fibers are diffuse rather than focal and that at least 50% of synapses are established on GABAergic local circuit neurons.

A previous study showed that neuron number in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is reduced following early gestational exposure to x-irradiation (Algan and Rakic [1997] J. Comp. Neurol. 12: 335-352). Here we examine whether similarly timed irradiation decreases neuron number in three associational thalamic nuclei: mediodorsal (MD), anterior, and pulvinar. Ten macaques were exposed to multiple doses of x-rays (total exposure (175-350 cGy) in early gestation (E33-E42) or midgestation (E70-E90); eight nonirradiated macaques were controls. Only the early-irradiated monkeys, not the midgestationally irradiated animals, exhibited deficits in whole-thalamic neuron (-15%) and glia numbers (-21%) compared with controls. Reduction of neuron number (-26%) and volume (-29%) was particularly pronounced in MD. In contrast, cell number and volume were not significantly decreased in the anterior or pulvinar nuclei following early gestational irradiation. Thus, reduced thalamic neuron number was associated specifically with irradiation in early gestation. Persistence of the thalamic neuronal deficit in adult animals indicates that prenatally deleted neurons had not been replenished during maturation or in adulthood. The selective reduction of MD neuron number also supports the protomap hypothesis that neurons of each thalamic nucleus originate sequentially from separate lines of neuronal stem cells (Rakic [1977a] J. Comp. Neurol. 176:23-52). The early gestationally irradiated macaque is discussed as a potentially useful model for studying the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia. J. Comp.

Pain or temperature sensations can be evoked in humans by electrical stimulation in a vaguely defined region of the posterolateral thalamus(2,3). Here we use anterograde tracing and single unit recordings to demonstrate that there is a distinct nucleus in the posterior thalamus of the macaque monkey that receives a dense, topographic input from spinothalamic lamina I neurons and in which almost all neurons are nociceptive- or thermoreceptive-specific. Immunohistochemical staining showed that this nucleus is defined by a dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus in the macaque, so we applied the same staining method to sections of human thalamus. We found a nearly identical fibre plexus localized within a distinct nucleus that is cytoarchitectonically homologous to the lamina I relay nucleus in the macaque thalamus. The stereotaxic coordinates of this nucleus and its location relative to the main somatosensory representation fit clinical descriptions of the pain-producing region in humans. We conclude that this is a specific thalamic nucleus for pain and temperature sensation in both monkey and human.;"UNIV MONTREAL,FAC MED DENT,DEPT STOMATOL,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA; UNIV MONTREAL,FAC MED DENT,CTR RECH SCI NEUROL,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA; LINKOPING UNIV,FAC HLTH SCI,DEPT CELL BIOL,S-58185 LINKOPING,SWEDEN";"Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Linkoping University";CRAIG, AD (corresponding author), BARROW NEUROL INST,DIV NEUROBIOL,350 W THOMAS RD,PHOENIX,AZ 85013, USA.;;Blomqvist, Anders/K-3990-2019;Blomqvist, Anders/0000-0002-6928-4473;;;;;28;419;429;1;16;MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD;LONDON;PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW;0028-0836;;;NATURE;Nature;DEC 22;1994;372;6508;;;;;770;773;;10.1038/372770a0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/372770a0;;;4;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;PY212;7695716;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994PY21200050;View Full Record in Web of Science

Magnetic resonance and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.

The animals had to choose correctly between pairs of stimuli drawn from a population of 16. Four of these stimuli were associated with 0 reward pellets, four with 1 pellet, four with 2 pellets and four with 4 pellets. Mediodorsal thalamic lesions including the medial part of the mediodorsal nucleus, similar to those which are frequently seen in Korsakoff amnesia, produced a severe impairment in this task. The impairment was seen both in memory for the quantity of reward, as expressed in choices between 1-pellet and 2-pellet stimuli or choices between 2-pellet and 4-pellet stimuli, and also in memory for the qualitative absence or presence of reward, as expressed in choices between 0-pellet and 1-pellet stimuli. The deficit in this task establishes that mediodorsal thalamic lesions in monkeys can impair long-term memory tasks, in addition to their known effects on several short-term memory tasks. The contrast between the present results and those of previous experiments on visual long-term memory in the monkey following mediodorsal thalamic lesions can be related to similar contrasts in studies of lesions in the amygdala, suggesting that the functions of these two structures are related.;;;GAFFAN, D (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;16;23;23;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Multiple injections of combinations of two dyes (diamidino yellow dihydrochloride, Evans blue, fast blue, granular blue) were made into either the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri or into the medial and lateral regions of the anterior sigmoid gyrus in the anesthetized dog. We found that the thalamic afferents of areas 4 and 6 arise from topographically organized bands of cells that traverse several thalamic nuclei and extend throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the thalamus. The most medial band included area 6-projecting neurons in the anterior nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus, the ventral anterior nucleus (VA), ventromedial nucleus (VM) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Within this band, cells projecting to medial area 6a alpha tended to be more numerous in the anterior nuclei, anterior parts of VA and VM and anterior and caudal parts of MD. Fewer cells in MD but more cells in caudal parts of VA and VM projected to lateral area 6a beta. Lateral bands of cells in central through lateral parts of VA and VL projected topographically to lateral area 4 on the anterior sigmoid gyrus and lateral through medial parts of postcruciate area 4. The most lateral band of cells in VL continued ventrally into the zona incerta. Area 4 also received input from VM and the central lateral (CL) and centrum medianum (CM) nuclei. Within regions of VA, VL and VM, cells from one band interspersed with cells from another, but there were very few double-labeled cells projecting to two cortical sites. When the present results are compared with our previous findings on the distribution of subcortical afferents to the motor thalamus, it appears that separate motor cortical areas may receive predominantly separate but also partially overlapping pathways in the dog.;HOWARD UNIV,COLL MED,DEPT ANAT,WASHINGTON,DC 20059;Howard University;SAKAI, ST (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT ANAT,B517 W FEE HALL,E LANSING,MI 48824, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NINCDS NS R01-18551] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;41;12;12;0;1;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0340-2061;;;ANAT EMBRYOL;Anat.

Three tracers were utilized: tritiated leucine, biotinylated dextran amine, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in combination with postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pallidothalamic fibers, upon entering the VAdc, gave off several collaterals that formed plexuses of varicose terminal branches within different cell clusters. The varicosities were aligned along somata and proximal dendrites of projection neurons providing dense input to each individual cell. At the electron microscopic level, labeled boutons displayed a predominantly flat and elongated shape. They contained a moderate number of pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and very large amounts of mitochondria, displayed symmetric synaptic contacts, and were immunoreactive for GABA. In the total sample of 128 autoradiographically labeled terminals, 64% were in synaptic contact with somata and primary dendrites of projection neurons, 14% formed synapses on proximal dendrites of undefined order, and only 7% established synaptic contacts on distal dendrites. Fifteen percent of the labeled boutons established synapses on distal dendrites of GABAergic local circuit neurons (LCN). Pallidal boutons were also found in complex synaptic arrangements: triads with three GABAergic synapses, and serial synapses with LCN dendrites that in turn established synaptic contacts on projection neuron somata or dendrites. These anatomical results suggest a dual effect of pallidal afferents to projection neurons: direct inhibition and disinhibition mediated by LCN. The findings indicate that the fine structure of pallidothalamic terminals in the monkey is similar to that described earlier in the cat. There are, however, interspecies differences in the distribution of pallidal input on postsynaptic targets and its participation in complex synaptic arrangements.

In this task the correct, rewarded, response in each scene was to a particular object of a pair, which always occupied a particular position in a unique background which had been generated using randomly chosen colours and shapes. In each session, the monkey learned a new list of these unique scenes. The animals then underwent surgical ablation of either the anterior thalamic nuclei or the cingulate cortex. It was found that the animals with anterior thalamic lesions showed a substantial impairment, whereas the monkeys with cingulate cortex ablations were not significantly impaired at the task. These results confirm the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei in episodic memory, and suggest that the cingulate gyrus is not a region which is crucial in the type of episodic memory task used in the present experiment.

This study explores the organization of the thalamic projections to the ventral striatum in the primate brain by means of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and Lucifer yellow (LY) retrograde tracer techniques. In addition, because functional and connective differences have been described for the core and shell. components of the nucleus accumbens in the rat and are thought to be similar in the primate, this study also explores whether these regions of the nucleus accumbens can be distinguished by their thalamic input. Tracer injections are placed in different portions of the ventral striatum, including the medial and lateral regions of the ventral striatum; the central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens; and the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Retrogradely labeled neurons are located mainly in the midline nuclear group (anterior and posterior paraventricular, paratenial, rhomboid, and reuniens thalamic nuclei) and in the parafascicular thalamic nucleus. Additional labeled cells are found in other portions of the intralaminar nuclear group as well as in other thalamic nuclei in the ventral, anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior thalamic nuclear groups. The distribution of labeled cells varies depending on the area of the ventral striatum injected. All regions of the ventral striatum receive strong projections from the midline thalamic nuclei and from the parafascicular nucleus. In addition, the medial region of the ventral striatum receives numerous projections from the central superior lateral nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision of the ventral anterior nucleus, and parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. After injection into the lateral region of the ventral striatum, few labeled neurons are seen scattered in nuclei of the intralaminar and ventral thalamic groups and occasional labeled cells in the mediodorsal nucleus. The central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens, receives a limited projection from the midline thalamic, predominantly from the rhomboid nucleus. It receives much smaller projections from the central medial nucleus and the ventral, anterior, and medial thalamic groups. The shell of the nucleus accumbens receives the most limited projection from the thalamus and is innervated almost exclusively by the midline thalamic nuclei and the central. medial and parafascicular nuclei. The shell is distinguished from the rest of the ventral striatum in that it receives the fewest projections from the ventral, anterior, medial, and lateral thalamic nuclei.

Actively detecting a vibrotactile stimulus and reporting its perception elicited a sustained poststimulus beta power increase in VPL and an alpha power decrease in S1, in both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent trials. These oscillatory dynamics in the somatosensory thalamocortical network depended on the behavioral context: they were stronger for the active detection condition than for a passive stimulation condition. Furthermore, contrasting stimulus-present vs. stimulus-absent responses, we found that poststimulus theta power increased in both VPL and S1, and alpha/beta power decreased in S1, reflecting the monkey's perceptual decision but not the motor response per se. Additionally, higher prestimulus alpha power in S1 correlated with an increased probability of the monkey reporting a stimulus, regardless of the actual presence of a stimulus. Thus, we found task-related modulations in oscillatory activity, not only in the neocortex but also in the thalamus, depending on behavioral context. Furthermore, oscillatory modulations reflected the perceptual decision process and subsequent behavioral response. We conclude that these early sensory regions, in addition to their primary sensory functions, may be actively involved in perceptual decision making.;"[Haegens, Saskia] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Haegens, Saskia] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Cognit Neurosci & Schizophrenia Program, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Haegens, Saskia; Jensen, Ole] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Vazquez, Yuriria; Zainos, Antonio; Alvarez, Manuel; Romo, Ranulfo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular Neurociencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Romo, Ranulfo] Colegio Nacl, Mexico City 06020, DF, Mexico";"Columbia University; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Radboud University Nijmegen; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";Romo, R (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular Neurociencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.;rromo@ifc.unam.mx;"Haegens, Saskia/W-2013-2018; Jensenq, Ole/D-2120-2010";"Haegens, Saskia/0000-0002-9676-6275; Jensenq, Ole/0000-0001-8193-8348; Alvarez, Manuel/0000-0003-4651-3525; zainos, antonio/0000-0001-6137-1794; romo, ranulfo/0000-0003-3529-3635; Vazquez, Yuriria/0000-0003-4198-1135";"Rubicon from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [446.11.009]; Vici from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [453.09.002]; Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme [056-14-011]; International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";"Rubicon from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Vici from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme; International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";"The authors thank Lucia Melloni for insightful feedback on the manuscript.S.H.was supported by Rubicon Grant 446.11.009 from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; O.J.was supported by Vici Grant 453.09.002 from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research and Netherlands Initiative for Brain and Cognition  The healthy brain scheme (056-14-011); R.R.was supported by an International Research Scholars Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and by grants from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a and Direccion del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.";;67;21;21;1;23;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;1091-6490;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

J;"Whelan, BM; Murdoch, BE";;;;"Whelan, BM; Murdoch, BE";;;Unravelling subcortical linguistic substrates: Comparison of thalamic versus cerebellar cognitive-linguistic regulation mechanisms;APHASIOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"RHESUS-MONKEY; LANGUAGE; LESIONS; ORGANIZATION; DIASCHISIS; DEFICITS; THOUGHT";The basal ganglia and cerebellum traditionally constitute motor-dedicated neural systems that facilitate movement via basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical and cerebellar ponto-thalamo-cortical pathways. Lesions of the basal ganglia typically result in poverty of movement (e.g., akinesia) or excessive movement (e.g., hyperkinesia), and lesions of the cerebellum result in incoordination of movement (e.g., ataxia). However, recent research has revealed that in addition to the primary motor cortex, the basal ganglia and cerebellum also demonstrate projection zones to the premotor cortex, frontal eye field , and prefrontal, inferotemporal, and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting a supplementary role for these structures (i.e., basal ganglia and cerebellum) in the regulation of cognitive processes. Subcortical cognitive deficits paralleling motor impairments such as difficulty in shifting attentional set and difficulty in coordinating mental activity have been described in the neuropsychological literature. However, correlates relative to hypolinguistic or dysmetric language processes are yet to be adequately defined. Aims: The aim of the current research, therefore, was to compare and contrast the language profiles of individuals with thalamic versus cerebellar lesions. Methods & Procedures: Two cases with surgically induced lesions of the left ventral intermediate thalamus, and two cases with spontaneous vascular infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere, served as experimental subjects in this research. General and high-level language profiles were compiled for each subject and performance compared to a roup of 16 non-neurologically impaired controls (NC). The criterion for anomalous performance was established as >= 2 SD below the NC group mean. Outcomes & Results : Evident deficits were largely restricted to complex language functions, irrespective of lesion type. Of note, however, was that thalamic lesions were associated with a higher overall proportion of significantly reduced test scores, as well as greater magnitudes of decline from normal when compared to cerebellar lesions. Conclusions: These results lend support to working theories of subcortical participation in language that promote a superordinate role for the thalamus in the regulation of higher-level lexical-semantic processes. Further more , the present findings also highlight the need to consider a novel role for the left cerebellar hemisphere in coordinating cognitive-linguistic systems.;Univ Queensland, Motor Speech & Neurogen Language Ctr, Div Speech Pathol, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia;University of Queensland;Whelan, BM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Motor Speech & Neurogen Language Ctr, Div Speech Pathol, Sch Hlth & Rehabil Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;bmw@uq.edu.au;Murdoch, Bruce E/C-1397-2012;Whelan, Brooke-Mai/0000-0002-7909-3160;;;;;33;10;10;0;5;PSYCHOLOGY PRESS;HOVE;27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND;0268-7038;;;APHASIOLOGY;Aphasiology;DEC;2005;19;12;;;;;1097;1106;;10.1080/02687030500174050;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02687030500174050;;;10;"Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Clinical Neurology; Rehabilitation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology; Linguistics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Rehabilitation";998YV;;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000234356700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Neurons convergent for baroreceptor and nociceptive input have also been identified in the homologous anterior insula of the primate. Whether similar convergent cells exist in the ventrobasal thalamus was investigated in 30 urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Six classes of cells were identified in the right ventrobasal thalamus: (a) 83/159 (52%) baroreceptive and nociceptive convergent units; (b) 2/159 (1%) convergent cells responding to baroreceptor activation and light touch; (c) 44/159 (28%) purely nociceptive units; (d)10/159 (6%) purely baroreceptive units; (e) 1/159 (0.6%) cells responding to brush alone and (f) 19/159 (12%) unresponsive units. Of the viscerosomatic convergent cells, 66/85 (78%) were situated in the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPL), 6/85 (7%) in the ventroposterolateral parvicellular nucleus (VPLpc), and 13/85 (15%) in the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM). Fifteen right ventrobasal thalamic units were antidromically activated and 34 units orthodromically activated by right posterior insular microstimulation. Cobalt injection into the right ventrobasal thalamus blocked the right insular response to baroreceptor activation by > 70%. These data indicate: (a) baroreceptive and somatosensory nociceptive convergent units exist in the ventrobasal thalamus; (b) thalamic convergent neurons project directly to the ipsilateral posterior insula and receive reciprocal insulothalamic projections; and (c) a significant proportion of baroreceptor input relays to the posterior insula through the ipsilateral ventrobasal thalamus.

In this work, a complete characterization of NA axons and Alpha adrenoceptors distributions is provided. NA axons, revealed by immunohistochemistry against the synthesizing enzyme and the NA transporter, are present in all thalamic nuclei. The most densely innervated ones are the midline nuclei, intralaminar nuclei (paracentral and parafascicular), and the medial sector of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDm). The ventral motor nuclei and most somatosensory relay nuclei receive a moderate NA innervation. The pulvinar complex receives a heterogeneous innervation. The lateral geniculate nucleus (GL) has the lowest NA innervation. Alpha adrenoceptors were analyzed by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Alpha-1 receptor densities are higher than Alpha-2 densities. Overall, axonal densities and Alpha adrenoceptor densities coincide; although some mismatches were identified. The nuclei with the highest Alpha-1 values are MDm, the parvocellular part of the ventral posterior medial nucleus, medial pulvinar, and midline nuclei. The nucleus with the lowest Alpha-1 receptor density is GL. Alpha-2 receptor densities are highest in the lateral dorsal, centromedian, medial and inferior pulvinar, and midline nuclei.

Previous studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus and those in the caudate nucleus exhibit periodic firing modulation when the animals attempt to detect a single omission of isochronous repetitive audiovisual stimuli. To understand how these subcortical signals are sent and processed through the thalamocortical pathways, we examined single-neuron activities in the central thalamus of two macaque monkeys (one female and one male). We found that three types of neurons responded to each stimulus in the sequence in the absence of movements. Reactive-type neurons showed sensory adaptation and gradually waned the transient response to each stimulus. Predictive-type neurons steadily increased the magnitude of the suppressive response, similar to neurons previously reported in the cerebellum. Switch-type neurons initially showed a transient response, but after several cycles, the direction of firing modulation reversed and the activity decreased for each repetitive stimulus. The time course of Switch-type activity was well explained by the weighted sum of activities of the other types of neurons. Furthermore, for only Switch-type neurons the activity just before stimulus omission significantly correlated with behavioral latency, indicating that this type of neuron may carry a more advanced signal in the system detecting stimulus omission. These results suggest that the central thalamus may transmit integrated signals to the cerebral cortex for temporal information processing, which are necessary to accurately predict rhythmic event timing.;"[Matsuyama, Kei; Tanaka, Masaki] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan";Hokkaido University;Tanaka, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Physiol, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608638, Japan.;masaki@med.hokudai.ac.jp;Tanaka, Masaki/D-9199-2011;Tanaka, Masaki/0000-0002-6177-1314;"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [17H03539, 18H04928, 18H05523]; Takeda Science Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17H03539, 18H05523, 18H04928] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Takeda Science Foundation(Takeda Science Foundation (TSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grants 17H03539, 18H04928, and 18H05523).

The MITN that project to cingulate cortex have a prominent innervation by norepinephrinergic axons primarily originating from the LC. The hypothesis explored in this study is that MITN neurons that project to cingulate cortex receive a disproportionately high LC input that may modulate nociceptive afferent flow into the forebrain. Ten cynomolgus monkeys were evaluated for dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DBH) immunohistochemistry, and nuclei with moderate or high DBH activity were analyzed for intermediate neurofilament proteins, calbindin (CB), and calretinin (CR). Sections of all but DBH were thionin counterstained to assure precise localization in the mediodorsal and MITN, and cytoarchitecture was analyzed with neuron-specific nuclear binding protein. Moderate high levels of DBH-immunoreactive (ir) axons were generally associated with high densities of CB-ir and CR-ir neurons and low levels of neurofilament proteins. The paraventricular, superior centrolateral, limitans and central nuclei had relatively high and evenly distributed DBH, the magnocellular mediodorsal and paracentral nuclei had moderate DBH-ir, and other nuclei had an even and low level of activity. Some nuclei also have heterogeneities in DBH-ir that raised questions of functional segregation. The anterior multiformis part of the mediodorsal nucleus but not middle and caudal levels had high DBH activity. The posterior parafascicular nucleus (Pf) was heterogeneous with the lateral part having little DBH activity, while its medial division had most DBH-ir axons and its multiformis part had only a small number. These findings suggest that the LC may regulate nociceptive processing in the thalamus. The well established role of cingulate cortex in premotor functions and the projections of Pf and other MITN to the limbic striatum suggests a specific role in mediating motor outflow for the LC-innervated nuclei of the MITN.;"[Vogt, Brent A.; Vogt, Leslie J.] Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, Manlius, NY USA; [Vogt, Brent A.; Vogt, Leslie J.] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Manlius, NY USA; [Hof, Patrick R.] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Friedman, David P.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Sikes, Robert W.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Wake Forest University; Northeastern University";Vogt, BA (corresponding author), Cingulum NeuroSci Inst, 4435 Stephanie Dr, Manlius, NY USA.;bvogt@twcny.rr.com;"Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015; Friedman, David P/G-7842-2011";"Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410; Friedman, David P/0000-0003-1732-2404";"NIH-NINDS [RO1-NS44222]; James S.

Methods: Nissl-stained sections were examined to determine the boundaries of, and the distribution of neuronal sizes within, the medial pulvinar, In addition, Golgi-impregnated neurons were examined and drawn for analysis, Only rhesus monkey specimens were used, and the material had been prepared previously for other studies. Results: Projection neurons have round to oval somata and moderate numbers of primary dendrites that extend for short distances before branching into many secondary branches, Two variations of projection neurons (P1 and P2) were distinguished on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic tree, Both varieties have short dendrites that radiate in all directions, They differ in that P2 cells have longer second tier dendrites than P1 cells, Three types of local circuit neurons, tufted, radiating and varicose, were distinguished on the basis of their dendritic morphology, Four types of afferent fibers were identified. Type 1 afferents form cone-shape terminal arbors. Type 2 afferents are similar to those reported for retinal or cortical terminals, Type 3 afferents are of medium thickness and of an unknown origin, Type 4 afferents are thin and have small varicosities consistent with previously described cortical afferents, Afferent fibers are predominantly oriented along the mediolateral axis of the nucleus. We observed putative contacts between some afferents and local circuit neurons and between local circuit neurons and projection neurons, Conclusions: Medial pulvinar neurons are generally smaller and rounder than those found in the adjacent pulvinar nuclei, These results provide additional evidence for structural distinctions between thalamic nuclei having different functions, However, the observed differences are subtle, In addition, the data in this report provide morphological evidence that cortical signals are likely to be integrated by means of the circuitry located within the nucleus.

Synaptic relationships of 17 CB with projection neuron dendrites (PNd) and local circuit neuron dendrites (LCNd) were analyzed in serial ultra thin sections from dorsal and ventral VL regions, which are known to differ cytoarchitecturally and functionally. Three terminals were reconstructed using three-dimensional (3D) computer image analysis techniques to obtain volumetric and planar measurements. C-B in the ventral VL were often flat and elongated with synaptic vesicles arranged in clusters. Each CB was engaged with one PNd and one to four LCNd. A single bouton formed 8-50 synaptic contacts, with those on PNd outnumbering the ones on LCNd 4.1:1. Only some CB in the ventral VL were engaged in complex synaptic arrangements such as triads and serial synapses. Most CB in the dorsal VL displayed a roundish shape and numerous uniformly distributed synaptic vesicles. They formed 5-25 synaptic contacts with a 3:1 ratio of contacts on PNd compared with those on LCNd. CB in the dorsal VL participated in a variety of complex synaptic arrangements. Two types of triads were found: classic with CB, PNd and LCNd, and unconventional with CB and two LCNd. CB were also involved in serial synapses with two LCNd or LCNd and another PNd, and serial sequential synapses with two LCNd and a PNd. Three glomerulus-like structures were encountered in the dorsal VL. 3D reconstruction and volumetric measurements revealed that synaptic contacts formed by CB on PNd had varying shapes and sizes (0.022-0.274 mu m(2)). Synapses formed on LCNd were larger (0.09-0.407 mu m(2)). The total area of all active zones of a single CB on LCNd was either equal to or about 40% smaller than that of synapses on PNd. The entire active zone area comprised 1-1.6% of the total CB surface area and did not seem to correlate with the volume. Synaptic contacts formed by associated LCNd on PNd in complex arrangements were usually small (0.021-0.044 mu m(2)). The results suggest that: synapses formed by CB on PNd and LCNd, and synapses formed by LCNd on PNd may differ in strength; a variety of different circuits participate in the processing of cerebellar afferent information in the primate VL; and these circuits differ in functionally different VL subdivisions.";"UNIV IOWA, COLL MED, DEPT ANAT, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA; UNIV IOWA, COLL MED, IMAGE ANANL FACIL, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA";"University of Iowa; University of Iowa";;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R0I NS24188] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;65;22;22;2;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Injections that filled all of VLpv labeled abundant neurons that were inhomogeneously distributed among many unlabeled cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN). Single large pressure injections made in face-, forelimb-, or hindlimb-related portions of VLpv using physiological guidance labeled numerous neurons that were broadly dispersed within a coarse somatotopographic anteroposterior (foot to face) gradient in the dentate and interposed nuclei. Small iontophoretic injections labeled fewer neurons with the same somatotopographic gradient, but strikingly, the labeled neurons in these cases were as broadly dispersed as in cases with large injections. Simultaneous injections of multiple tracers in VLpv (one tracer per somatic region with no overlap between injections) confirmed the general somatotopography but also demonstrated clearly the overlapping distributions and the close intermingling of neurons labeled with different tracers. Significantly, very few neurons (<2%) were double-labeled. This organizational pattern contrasts with the concept of a segregated point-to-point somatotopy and instead resembles the complex patterns that have been observed throughout the motor pathway. These data support the idea that muscle synergies are represented anatomically in the DCbN by a general somatotopography in which intermingled neurons and dispersed but selective connections provide the basis for plastic, adaptable movement coordination of different parts of the body.;"[Evrard, Henry C.; (Bud) Craig, A.

In the earliest period analyzed, from 5-6 weeks of gestation, dorsal and ventral parts of the human thalamus were poorly differentiated structures forming the sides of the third ventricle. At 6 g.w., the prospective thalamic anlage consisted of the ventricular (VZ), the intermediate (IZ) and the marginal zones (MZ). The neurons in the VZ were bipolar and radially arranged to the ventricular surface. From 6-8 gestational weeks detached bipolar or branched bipolar cells with horizontal or oblique orientation were encountered in the IZ and occasionally in the MZ. In the period between 10-14 weeks of gestation, segregation of neurons into different thalamic nuclei began. The lateral geniculate nucleus, centrum medianum and mediodorsal nucleus were the first to be distinguished. In comparison with the previous period, the neurons throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the thalamus were more differentiated, with a higher number of primary dendrites that were often bifurcated. This resulted in various shapes of immature neurons: simple uni- and bipolar (type 1), branched uni- and bipolar (type 2) and young multipolar (type 3). In addition, the first spines were frequently observed on dendrites at 12 weeks of gestation. At 14-16 weeks of gestation, segregation of the neurons into thalamic nuclei continued. The neurons exhibited further dendritic differentiation that followed the caudo rostral gradient. For the first time, multipolar neurons, especially in the caudal part, could be sub-divided into two classes: multipolar with a 'bushy' appearance, the result of many primary dendrites with several bifurcations and 'simpler' multipolar neurons with fewer and less branched primary dendrites. Neuronal differentiation was further expressed by an increase in the total dendritic length and somatic surface, up to six and three times, respectively, from the earliest period analyzed to 16 weeks of gestation. Dendritic length increased initially by the formation of new primary branches and their elongation and secondly by formation of higher branch orders. At 16 g.w., a group of immature cells were observed dorsally, on the frontal sections through the rostral thalamus. Its ganglionic eminence origin is discussed.;INST BIOL RES DR SINISA STANKOVIC, 29 NOVEMBRA 142, YU-11000 BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIA;;;;;;;;;;73;30;30;0;1;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0378-3782;1872-6232;;EARLY HUM DEV;Early Hum.

This report focuses on posterolateral. thalamus, where prior anterograde tracing observations identified the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus (VMpo) as the major projection target of lamina I STT neurons. Large injections in posterolateral thalamus labeled predominantly STT cells in lamina I throughout the spinal cord. In cases with medium-sized or small injections centered in VMpo, almost all labeled STT cells (similar to 90%) were lamina I neurons. Small injections revealed a posteroanterior (foot to hand) somatotopographic organization consistent with that observed in prior anterograde tracing work; injections in posterior VMpo labeled primarily lumbosacral lamina I cells, whereas injections placed more anteriorly in VMpo labeled primarily cervical lamina I cells.

Injections of WGA-HRP in the MD resulted in retrograde labeling of cells in the anteromedial segment of the NRT, the so-called rostral NRT pole. Injections of WGA-HRP and BDA in this NRT region resulted in dense anterograde labeling in the MD. Labeled NRT fibers gave off several collaterals to different MD regions ending with terminal plexuses of thin varicose fibers. In the neuropil, the varicosities were distributed at random, and no tendency to form pericellular baskets was noted. Postembeddng immunocytochemistry for GABA was performed on the tissue containing anterograde WGA-HRP label for identification of NRT boutons under electron microscope. The double-labeled boutons were of small to medium size, contained a large number of pleomorphic vesicles, few mitochondria, and formed multiple symmetric synaptic contacts. The number of contacts established by one bouton ranged from 1 to 4 with an average of 1.8 per bouton. About 60% of these boutons made synapses on distal dendrites of GABAergic local circuit neurons; 33% of synaptic contacts were on distal dendrites of thalamocortical neurons, and the rest on their proximal dendrites and soma. NRT boutons were also found in serial synapses and triads.

To assist our understanding of this issue, we have compared the anatomical distribution of V1 intrinsic relays that carry information derived from magno- (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus between thalamic recipient neurons and interareal efferent neuron groups within area V1. We used small, iontophoretic injections of biocytin placed in individual cortical laminae of area V1 to trace orthograde and retrograde inter- and intralaminar projections. In either the same or adjacent sections, the tissue was reacted for cytochrome oxidase (CO), which provides important landmarks for different efferent neuron populations located in CO rich blobs and CO poor interblobs in laminae 2/3, as well as defining clear boundaries for the populations of efferent neurons in laminae 4A and 4B. This study shows that the interblobs, but not the blobs, receive direct input from thalamic recipient 4C neurons; the interblobs receive relays from mid 4C neurons (believed to receive convergent M and P inputs), while blobs receive indirect inputs from either M or P (or both) pathways through layers 4B (which receives M relays from layer 4C alpha) and 4A (which receives P relays directly from the thalamus as well as from layer 4C beta). The property of orientation selectivity, most prominent in the interblob regions and in layer 4B, may have a common origin from oriented lateral projections made by mid 4C spiny stellate neurons. While layer 4B efferents may emphasize M characteristics and layer 4A efferents emphasize P characteristics, the dendrites of their constituent pyramidal neurons may provide anatomical access to the other channel since both blob and interblob regions in layers 2/3 have anatomical access to M and P driven relays, despite functional differences in the way these properties may be expressed in the two compartments.";"UNIV LONDON,INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT VISUAL SCI,LONDON EC1V 9EL,ENGLAND; JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,KRIEGER MIND BRAIN INST,BALTIMORE,MD";"University of London; University College London; Johns Hopkins University";;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY10021, EYO6275, EYO5282] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;39;114;115;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;MAY-JUN;1994;11;3;;;;;467;489;;10.1017/S0952523800002406;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800002406;;;23;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";NH296;8038123;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994NH29600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

While both subcortical structures process information in basically segregated loops that primarily interact in the neocortex, direct subcortical interaction has been recently confirmed by neuroanatomical studies using viral transneuronal tracers in non-human primate brains. The thalamus is thought to be the main relay station of both projection systems. Yet, our understanding of subcortical basal ganglia and cerebellar interconnectivity within the human thalamus is rather sparse, primarily due to limitation in the acquisition of in vivo tracing. Consequently, we strive to characterize projections of both systems and their potential overlap within the human thalamus by diffusion MRI and tractography. Our analysis revealed a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient for pallido-thalamic connections in: (1) the ventral-anterior thalamus, (2) the intralaminar nuclei, and (3) midline regions. Conversely, we found a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient for dentato-thalamic projections predominantly in: (1) the ventral-lateral and posterior nucleus; (2) dorsal parts of the intralaminar nuclei and the subparafascicular nucleus, and (3) the medioventral and lateral mediodorsal nucleus. A considerable overlap of connectivity pattern was apparent in intralaminar nuclei and midline regions. Notably, pallidal and cerebellar projections were both hemispherically lateralized to the left thalamus. While strikingly consistent with findings from transneuronal studies in non-human primates as well as with pre-existing anatomical studies on developmentally expressed markers or pathological human brains, our assessment provides distinctive connectional fingerprints that illustrate the anatomical substrate of integrated functional networks between basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Thereby, our findings furnish useful implications for cerebellar contributions to the clinical symptomatology of movement disorders.";"[Pelzer, Esther A.; Melzer, Corina; von Cramon, D.

VPL responses were compared to previously reported responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) under identical stimulus conditions, and to reports of peripheral afferent fiber responses to passively applied gratings. VPL responses more closely resembled those of peripheral afferent fibers than those of SI in important respects: lack of independent responses to roughness, force, and velocity; high temporal and force fidelity; and response patterns that closely followed the shape of elevated metal strips used to separate pairs of gratings.

Injections of tritiated amino acids were placed within individual cytoarchitectonic areas of the frontal cortex in the rhesus monkey. It was demonstrated that the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex (areas 46, 9/46, and 9) and its medial extension (medial areas 9 and 9/32) is the origin of a specific fiber pathway, running posteriorly as part of the cingulum bundle, and terminating mainly in the retrosplenial area 30 and the posterior presubiculum. This fiber bundle therefore provides the anatomical substrate of a functional interaction between the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and the hippocampal memory system for the monitoring of information within working memory.

We studied the responsiveness of neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) to electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), and the ventral subnucleus of the thalamus (VPLo) with chronically implanted electrodes. 2. All neurons examined in this study were characterized by their relation to a motor task performed by the animals. They responded to stimulation of the cortical or thalamic area with excitation from one area alone (n = 128) or from multiple areas (n = 84) of all combinations. In a majority of neurons, response latencies to both cortical and thalamic stimulation were within 5 ms. 3. A vast majority of neurons (80%) that were active during a preparatory period for forthcoming reaching movements were activated by SMA stimulation. They were activated only infrequently by SI or thalamic stimulation. 4. Movement-related neurons(active immediately before and during reaching movements) were activated by thalamic, SI, or SMA stimulation or by any combination of those stimuli. More than half of the movement-related neurons activated exclusively by either thalamic or SMA stimulation exhibited activity onset times earlier than those observed in the earliest muscles. By contrast, most movement-related neurons that responded only to SI stimulation were late in their activity onset. 5. These findings suggest that the SMA input to MI is important in developing a preparatory type of activity in MI, whereas the thalamus (VPLo) provides substantial inputs in movement execution. The roles played by inputs from SI and SMA in relation to motor execution an debatable and are discussed here with reference to previous reports.;TOHOKU UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,AOBA KU,SENDAI 980,JAPAN;Tohoku University;;;;;;;;;71;40;41;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Thalamic infarcts in paramedian artery territory are seen fairly frequently owing to certain peculiarities of the vascularization of the thalamus. However, clinical diagnosis is usually difficult because of the many varieties and peculiarities of the symptomatology. Material and Methods. We present a review of twelve cases of bilateral paramedian infarcts of the thalamus seen in our Department of Neurology and in a private surgery. We analyze the symptoms and their relationship to the neuro-radiological findings. Finally we compare our observations with the descriptions published by other authors and seek an anatomo-functional relationship for each of the symptoms and signs observed. Results. The usual clinical outline in our patients included disorders of consciousness, different types of oculomotor disorders and cerebellar symptoms, mainly of gait. Other less common findings were memory disorders and abnormal movements. In no case were there sensory changes and pyramidal signs were rare in the absence of significant extra-thalamic lesions. Conclusions. Our findings, although generally comparable to those described in the literature consulted, were somewhat different with regard to cerebellar symptoms arm the absence of sensory and pyramidal signs. We also emphasize the marked differences seen between the individual patients in our series. A good knowledge of the possible clinical variants of these lesions is necessary for a correct initial diagnostic approach in the study of these patients [REVNEUROL 1997, 25. 1353-62].;HOSP NTRA SRA ARANZAZU,NEUROL SERV,SAN SEBASTIAN,GUIPUZCOA,SPAIN;;;;Marti-Masso, J.F:/D-8619-2013;Marti-Masso, J.F:/0000-0001-8428-4386;;;;;31;5;6;0;0;REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA;BARCELONA;C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN;0210-0010;;;REV NEUROLOGIA;Rev.

Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the ventral parts of dentate nuclei. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the VL were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the thalamus. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the VL either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different VL locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the thalamus. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the VL that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.

Brain tissue from macaques was immunoreacted by means of antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to histamine and processed for light and electron microscopy. A dense plexus of thin, highly branched ChAT-immunoreactive axons laden with varicosities was found in all layers of the dLGN including the koniocellular laminae and in the pregeniculate nucleus. ChAT label was more dense in magnocellular layers 1 and 2 than in parvocellular layers 3-6 and relatively sparse in the interlaminar zones. Varicosities associated with the cholinergic axons had an average of three conventional asymmetric synapses per varicosity, and these appeared to contact dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons. Histamine-immunoreactive axons were distributed homogeneously throughout all laminar and interlaminar zones of the dLGN, but mere denser in the pregeniculate nucleus than in the dLGN. Histaminergic axons branched infrequently and were typically larger in caliber than cholinergic axons. The overwhelming majority of varicosities were found en passant and rarely displayed conventional synapses, despite the abundance of synaptic vesicles, and were not associated preferentially with specific cellular structures. The innervation of the macaque dLGN complex by cholinergic and histaminergic systems is consistent with their proposed role in state dependent modulation of thalamic activity. The dense and highly synaptic innervation by cholinergic axons supports the proposal of additional involvement of these axons in functions related to eye movements. Anat Rec 255:295-305, 1999.

Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.;"[Mayer, Andrei] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ciencias Fisiol, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ S-N, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Lewenfus, Gabriela; da Franca, Joao Guedes] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biophys Carlos Chagas Filho, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Bittencourt-Navarrete, Ruben Ernesto] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Physiol, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, Brazil; [Clasca, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain";"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Autonomous University of Madrid";"Mayer, A (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ciencias Fisiol, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ S-N, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;da Franca, JG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biophys Carlos Chagas Filho, Ave Carlos Chagas Filho 373, BR-21941902 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.";"andreimayer87@gmail.com; jgfranca@biof.ufrj.br";Cabré, Francisco Clasca/AAR-9907-2021;Cabré, Francisco Clasca/0000-0003-0718-1337;"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ; CNPq (Programa de Ciencia sem Fronteiras-Programa Pesquisador Visitante Especial) (PVE 2014) [024.028/2017, 400730/2014-6]";"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); CNPq (Programa de Ciencia sem Fronteiras-Programa Pesquisador Visitante Especial) (PVE 2014)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF))";Grants from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq-Brasil and Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro-FAPERJ.

Examination of the synaptic organization in unreacted tissue revealed several distinct synaptic types distributed among glomerular and nonglomerular regions of the neuropil. Within glomeruli, three presynaptic terminal classes were found. The majority of profiles (as many as eight to ten per glomerulus) were presynaptic dendrites (PSDs) forming symmetric synaptic contacts with a central dendrite, and occasionally with other PSDs. One or two large terminals densely packed with round vesicles (LR terminals) were also present in each glomerulus. This terminal class made multiple asymmetric contacts with the central dendrite, as well as with many PSDs within the glomerulus. Finally, small terminals with round vesicles (SR terminals) formed asymmetric synaptic junctions with PSDs in some glomeruli. PSDs and SR terminals were also found in the extraglomerular neuropil, although in different proportions than in the glomeruli. In the extraglomerular neuropil SR terminals were the most abundant terminal class and these terminals made synaptic contacts with dendrites of all sizes. PSDs were seen in considerably smaller numbers than in the glomeruli. Finally, the extraglomerular neuropil contained a moderate number of small to medium terminals that formed symmetric synaptic junctions (SF terminals) with cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes. Synaptic profiles related to corticothalamic inputs were identified by injecting the prefrontal cortex of two rhesus monkeys with H-3-leucine and -proline and analyzing the distribution and morphology of radiolabeled terminals. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains over different tissue compartments revealed a positive labeling index for two terminal classes: SR and LR terminals. Labeled SR terminals were concentrated in the extraglomerular neuropil and labeled LR terminals were found within glomeruli where they formed synaptic contact with the central dendrite, as well as with presynaptic dendrites of the glomerulus. In contrast to many other thalamic nuclei, cortical input to the mediodorsal nucleus arrives via two distinctive synaptic pathways, one terminating extraglomerularly and the other terminating within the synaptic glomeruli. The dual mode of corticothalamic terminations in the mediodorsal nucleus suggests a more potent and possibly different role for cortical input in the regulation of neuronal activity in this association nucleus than in sensory nuclei of the thalamus.;;;SCHWARTZ, ML (corresponding author), YALE UNIV, SCH MED, NEUROBIOL SECT, NEW HAVEN, CT 06510 USA.;;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [R01-MH38546] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [P01-NS 22807] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;44;82;83;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.

In this contribution the thalamus is regarded as an important place of interaction between the input and the output organization of the basal ganglia. In support of this idea, a brief overview is provided of some of the most recent findings concerning the thalamus in relation to the basal ganglia circuitry. In particular, we have focused on the thalamostriatal projections themselves, on the output of the basal ganglia to the thalamus and also on the overlapping territories between the thalamic projection of the output nuclei and the thalamostriatal neurons. These data support the existence of several thalamic feedback circuits within the basal ganglia neural system. Finally, some considerations are provided upon the functional significance of these thalamic feedback circuits in the overall organization of the basal ganglia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Men had larger intracranial volume (ICV) than women, but ICV did not correlate with age in either sex. Thalamic, pontine, and cortical white matter volumes did not differ between men and women once ICV differences were taken into account, but men had more cortical gray matter than women even after accounting for ICV. Volumes of pons and thalamus were associated, independent of ICV, in women but not in men. Thalamic volume declined linearly with age at a similar rate in both men and women, whereas cortical gray matter volume declined more steeply with age in men than women. Both pontine and cortical white matter volumes remained stable across the age span in both men and women. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Association cortical regions of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes have been repeatedly implicated in the neuropathology of schizophrenia. Thus, the aim of the present postmortem study was to investigate the volumes of association thalamic nuclei in this disease. The volumes of the whole thalamus (THAL), MD and PUM were measured in each hemisphere of brains of 12 patients with schizophrenia and 13 age-matched and gender-matched normal control subjects without neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited significant volume reductions in both the MD and the PUM, the reductions being more pronounced in the PUM. The volume of the PUM in the left (-19.7%, P=0.02) and right ( -22.1%, P=0.01) hemispheres was significantly reduced in the schizophrenia group. The volume of the MD was reduced in both hemispheres in the schizophrenia group. However, the volume reduction was only significant in the left hemisphere ( -9.3%, P=0.03). Patients with schizophrenia also exhibited a decreased volume of the THAL in the left ( -16.4%, P=0.003) and right (-15.2%, P=0.006) hemispheres. There were no significant correlations between thalamic volumes and duration of illness or age of the patients. In conclusion, the present data indicate volume reductions of association thalamic nuclei in schizophrenia. These anatomical findings are consistent with the view that schizophrenia may be associated with disturbances of association cortical networks. However, the findings of a substantial volume reduction of the THAL suggest that the volumes of additional thalamic nuclei may be also reduced in schizophrenia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Particular subunits are associated with modulatory binding sites that affect receptor activity. NR1 was the most abundant subunit mRNA; NR2A, NR2B, and NR2D subunit mRNAs were also present, but were expressed in nucleus-specific patterns. Very high levels of [H-3]ifenprodil binding to the polyamine site of the NMDA complex were detected in a fairly homogenous distribution. Binding of the ion channel ligand [H-3]MK-801 was also abundant, and limbic nuclei expressed higher levels than motor nuclei or the reticular nucleus. [H-3]CGP39653 binding to the glutamate site of the NMDA receptor was the least abundant of the NMDA receptor binding sites. There was variability in the stoichiometric relationships of binding sites across nuclei, suggesting that there is heterogeneity in the pharmacological properties of NMDA receptors expressed in the thalamus. AMPA and kainate are also multimeric associations of specific: subunits that form ligand-gated ion channels. These subunits are encoded by specific genes: gluR1-gluR3 for AMPA receptors, and gluR5-gluR7 and KA1-KA2 fur kainate receptors. GluR4 and gluR6 mRNAs were, respectively the most abundant of the AMPA and kainate receptor subunit transcripts. Both AMPA and kainate receptor subunit transcripts were expressed in a nucleus-specific pattern. The binding of [H-3]kainate was higher than that of [H-3]AMPA throughout the thalamus, but AMPA subunit mRNA levels were three to five orders of magnitude higher than those encoding the kainate receptor subunits. The mismatch between the levels of expression of kainate receptor subunit transcripts and binding sites is suggestive of a presynaptic localization of kainate receptors on thalamic afferents. These results suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors are heterogeneously expressed in the thalamus of the primate, and that their differential expression is both subunit- and nucleus-specific, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BSI.

Axons were labeled from the thalamus by a fluorescent carbocyanine dye in fixed tissue or by transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin from the eye. Thalamic axons first reached the cortex 2 weeks after birth and grew into the developing cortical plate without a waiting period in the subplate. The first thalamocortical synapses were detected 2 weeks later solely throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate, where layer 6 cells previously have been shown to reside. As the thickness of the cortex increased with age, thalamocortical synapses were increasingly prevalent in the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. With the appearance of layer 4, thalamocortical synapses were found there as well as in the marginal zone and layer 6. There was no evidence for an early population of thalamocortical synapses in the subplate. The first synapses made by thalamic axons were in a region containing layer 6 cells, one of their normal targets in the mature cortex.;Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Dev Neurobiol & Endocrinol Grp, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia;Australian National University;Marotte, LR (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol Sci, Dev Neurobiol & Endocrinol Grp, POB 475, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.;;;;;;;;49;7;7;0;1;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Although CYPIBI protein is known to metabolize estradiol to catecholestrogens in the uterus. its localization and function in brain have not yet been described. To better understand CYPIBI distribution, we have combined in situ hybridization (ISH) for its mRNA with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CYPIBI protein in selected brain regions of male and female adult rhesus monkey mulatta). Blocks of formalin-fixed tissue obtained from the frontal cortex, hippocampus. thalamus, and amygdala were processed and embedded in paraffin. The), were then sectioned and stained as described for human tissue [Muskhelishvili, L., Thompson. P.A., Kusewitt, D.F., Wang, C., Kadlubar. F.F. 2001. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of cytochrome P450 I B I expression in human normal tissues. J. Histochem. Cytochern. 49, 229-236]. Results indicated widespread distribution of CYPIBI mRNA in both male and female monkey frontal cortex, hippocampus. thalamus, and amygdala. In contrast, although CYPIBI protein was co-localized with its mRNA in the female brains, it was primarily restricted to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the male brains. These results suggest that CYPIBI may subserve widespread metabolic functions in the female primate brain but have more restricted actions within the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of the male.

Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex(1-4). Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus ( TRN). Crick(5) argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that  the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway'', a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.;"[McAlonan, Kerry; Cavanaugh, James; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";McAlonan, K (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;km@nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute;National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the intramural research program of the National Eye Institute.

Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.;"[Afrasiabi, Mohsen; Redinbaugh, Michelle J.; Phillips, Jessica M.; Kambi, Niranjan A.; Mohanta, Sounak; Saalmann, Yuri B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Raz, Aeyal] Rambam Hlth Care Campus, Dept Anesthesiol, IL-3109601 Haifa, Israel; [Raz, Aeyal] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Fac Med, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Haun, Andrew M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Saalmann, Yuri B.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53705 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Rambam Health Care Campus; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";"Afrasiabi, M; Redinbaugh, MJ; Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;Saalmann, YB (corresponding author), Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53705 USA.";"afrasiabi@wisc.edu; mredinbaugh@wisc.edu; saalmann@wisc.edu";"Haun, Andrew M/I-4956-2012; Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023";"Haun, Andrew M/0000-0001-9458-8957; Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698";"NIH [R01MH110311, P51OD011106]; BSF [201732]; WNPRC pilot grant";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); BSF(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); WNPRC pilot grant";We thank the Tononi, Cirelli, and Banks Labs and D.

In order to compare these with histologically demonstrated connections of the PPN in monkeys, and thus to Support the use of PDT in humans, we have carried out PDT in a fixed rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) brain. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was carried out in a fixed post-mortem rhesus monkey brain using diffusion data acquired at 3T MRI (60 directions x 5 averages, b = 3000 s/mm(2), matrix size = 104 x 132 x 96, 720 x 720 x 720 mu m voxels). We identified the major connections of the PPN from single seed voxels that could be confidently located within the nucleus on the diffusion images. The organisation of these connections within a 3 x 3 x 3 voxel (similar to 10 mm(3)) region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. PDT confirmed that the rhesus monkey PPN connections with the basal ganglia and motor cortical areas matched those previously demonstrated using conventional anatomical tracing techniques. Furthermore, although the Organisation Of subcortical connections within the PPN has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, we show here in a rhesus monkey that there are clearly separated connections of the PPN with the thalamus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Thus, in addition to increasing confidence in the accuracy of PDT for tracing PPN connections and determining the Organisation of these connections within the PPN in vivo, our observations suggest that diffusion tractography will be a useful new technique to rapidly identify connections in animal brains pre-mortem and post-mortem.

This seems incompatible with the hypothesis that cells of the subplate (the lower component of the preplate in normal mammals) form an axonal scaffold that guides thalamic fibers and act as temporary targets for them (Blakemore and Molnar, 1990, Shatz et at., 1990). We used carbocyanine dyes to trace projections in wild-type and reeler mice between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 3. Preplate formation and early extension of corticofugal fibers to form a topographic array are indistinguishable in the two phenotypes. So too are the emergence of thalamic axons in topographic order through the primitive internal capsule, their meeting with preplate axons, and their distribution over the preplate scaffold. Distinctive differences appear after the cortical plate begins to accumulate below the preplate of reeler, causing the preplate axons to form oblique fascicles, running through the cortical plate. Thalamic axons then pass through the plate within the same fascicles and accumulate in the superplate layer for similar to 2-3 d, before defasciculating and plunging down to terminate deep in the cortical plate, creating the curious looping pattern seen in the adult. Thus, thalamocortical innervation in reeler follows the same algorithm of development but in relation to the misplaced population of early-born neurons. Far from challenging the theory that preplate fibers guide thalamic axons, reeler provides strong evidence for it.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Fac Univ Notre Dame Paix, Dept Physiol Humaine, Fac Med, B-5000 Namur, Belgium";"University of Oxford; University of Namur";Molnar, Z (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PT, England.;;Molnar, Zoltan/J-7281-2012;"Molnar, Zoltan/0000-0002-6852-6004; Blakemore, Colin/0000-0003-2659-7899; Adams, Richard/0000-0003-0280-0901";Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline;Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);;;77;117;118;0;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2-3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b-4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

Microelectrode recording was used to generate somatosensory maps in the posterior bank of the central sulcus and on the exposed cortical surface lateral to the lateral tip of the central sulcus in Macaca nemestrina. The area innervated by the contralateral trigeminal nerve is represented in an 8-mm mediolateral extent of area 3b lateral to the representation of the hand. Lateral to this, still within area 3b, there is an expanded representation of ipsilateral intra-oral structures measuring 6 mm in mediolateral extent. Both representations fill area 3b anteroposteriorly. The ipsilateral representation forms approximately 40% of the trigeminal representation, consistent with the amount of the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic nucleus devoted to representation of ipsilateral intra-oral structures. Comparison of the present results with maps of the face representation in other species of monkey shows a consistent somatotopy of the face between species; size variations are mainly related to the enlarged ipsi- and contralateral representations of the cheek pouches in macaques. The general somatotopy of the trigeminal representation in monkeys is consistent with that in other mammalian species.

Single or paired injections of anterogradely transported tracers, of varying anteroposterior extent, were made horizontally from behind in defined parts of the body representation in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and/or ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamic nuclei, and the distribution and density of labeled thalamocortical terminations were mapped in cortex. injections of increasing size in any dimension of VPL or VPM resulted in increasing accumulation of labeled terminals within the region of projection, implying extensive convergence of individual axons. Anteroposteriorly elongated injections labeled mediolaterally extended but anteroposteriorly restricted zones in cortex. Dorsoventral placement of an injection in VPL or VPM determined anteroposterior location of labeling in cortex. Dual injections separated mediolaterally or dorsoventrally by similar to 1 mm, and in different parts of the thalamic body or head-face representation gave rise to labeled thalamocortical terminations that overlapped extensively. For injection sites at different anteroposterior levels in VPL or VPM, the area of cortical convergence was related to their extent of anteroposterior coincidence. Labeled terminations arising from injections in immediately adjacent parts of VPL and VPM did not overlap in cortex. The extent of thalamocortical divergence and convergence revealed by these experiments is greater than that predictable from labeling of single axons and is sufficiently great to account for representational plasticity that exceeds the 1.5 mm cortical distance limit..;"Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Autonoma Madrid, Sch Med, Dept Morphol, Madrid 28029, Spain";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Autonomous University of Madrid";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 114 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;;Rausell, Estrella/L-8781-2014;Rausell Tamayo, Estrella/0000-0002-1129-7116;"NCI NIH HHS [U01 CA091343] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 21377, R01 NS021377] Funding Source: Medline";"NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;45;58;59;0;2;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Here, we collected resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted MRI data before and after male rhesus macaque monkeys received extensive training to learn novel visuospatial discriminations (reward-guided learning). We found functional connectivity changes in orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, inferotemporal, entorhinal, retrosplenial, and anterior cingulate cortices, the subicular complex, and the dorsal, medial thalamus. These corticocortical and thalamocortical changes in functional connectivity were accompanied by related white matter structural alterations in the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and ventral prefrontal tract: tracts that connect (sub)cortical networks and are implicated in learning and memory processes in monkeys and humans. After the well-trained monkeys received fornix transection, they were impaired in learning new visuospatial discriminations. In addition, the functional connectivity profile that was observed after the training was altered. These changes were accompanied by white matter changes in the ventral prefrontal tract, although the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus remained unchanged. Our experiments highlight the importance of different communication relayed among corticocortical and thalamocortical circuitry for the ability to learn new visuospatial associations (learning-to-learn) and to make reward-guided decisions.;"[Pelekanos, Vassilis; Mason, Stuart; Mitchell, Anna S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3SR, England; [Premereur, Elsie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro & Psychophysiol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Mitchell, Daniel J.] Univ Cambridge, MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England; [Chakraborty, Subhojit] UCL, Inst Neurol, Dept Neuroinflammat, Queen Sq Multiple Sclerosis Ctr, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Lee, Andy C.

In the oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task, monkeys needed to make a memory-guided saccade to the cue location, whereas in the rotatory oculomotor delayed-response (R-ODR) task, they needed to make a memory-guided saccade 90(o) clockwise from the cue direction. The directions of population vectors calculated from populations of cue- and response-period activities were similar to the cue and saccade target directions, respectively, which confirmed that population vectors represent information regarding the directions of the visual cue and the saccade target. We then calculated population vectors of delay-period activity using a sliding 250-ms time window. In the ODR task, population vectors were directed toward the cue direction throughout the delay. However, in the R-ODR task, they gradually rotated from the cue direction to the saccade target direction. Based on a comparison with the results obtained from DLPFC neurons, the rotation of population vectors started earlier in the MD than in the DLPFC, suggesting that the motor information regarding forthcoming saccade is provided from the MD.;"[Funahashi, Shintaro] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Watanabe, Yumiko; Takeda, Kazuyoshi; Funahashi, Shintaro] Kyoto Univ, Dept Cognit & Behav Sci, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Kyoto 6008501, Japan; [Watanabe, Yumiko] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Neurosci Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan";"Kyoto University; Kyoto University; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST)";Funahashi, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;sfunahashi@mbox.kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp;Watanabe, Yumiko/N-6064-2016;Watanabe, Yumiko/0000-0001-6747-0590;"Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology [18020016, 14380367, 17300103, 18730481]; 21st Century COE Program (D-2 to Kyoto University), MEXT, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14380367, 18020016, 18730481, 17300103, 21240024] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); 21st Century COE Program (D-2 to Kyoto University), MEXT, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"The Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture, and Technology (MEXT; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas-System study on higher order brain functions [18020016 to S.

However, the functional contribution of the rhesus macaque monkey parvocellular nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDpc) in these key higher cognitive processes remains unknown. This study investigated the impact of MDpc damage in cognition. Preoperatively, animals were trained on an object-in-place scene discrimination task that assesses rapid learning of novel information within each session. Bilateral neurotoxic (NMDA and ibotenic acid) MDpc lesions did not impair new learning unless the monkey had also sustained damage to the magnocellular division of the MD (MDmc). Contralateral unilateral MDpc and MDmc damage also impaired new learning, while selective unilateral MDmc damage produced new learning deficits that eventually resolved with repeated testing. In contrast, during food reward (satiety) devaluation, monkeys with either bilateral MDpc damage or combined MDpc and MDmc damage showed attenuated food reward preferences compared to unoperated control monkeys; the selective unilateral MDmc damage left performance intact. Our preliminary results demonstrate selective dissociable roles for the two adjacent nuclei of the primate MD, namely, MDpc, as part of a frontal cortical network, and the MDmc, as part of a frontal-temporal cortical network, in learning, memory and the cognitive control of behavioural choices after changes in reward value. Moreover, the functional cognitive deficits produced after differing MD damage show that the different subdivisions of the MD thalamus support distributed neural networks to rapidly and fluidly incorporate task-relevant information, in order to optimise the animals' ability to receive rewards.";"[Chakraborty, Subhojit; Ouhaz, Zakaria; Mason, Stuart; Mitchell, Anna S.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Tinsley Bldg,Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SR, England";University of Oxford;Mitchell, AS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Tinsley Bldg,Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SR, England.;anna.mitchell@psy.ox.ac.uk;"Mitchell, Anna S/Q-1196-2019; Ouhaz, Zakaria/AAB-7622-2019";"Mitchell, Anna S/0000-0001-8996-1067; ";"UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award [G0800329]; Wellcome Trust [110157/Z/15/Z]; Royal Society Newton International Training Fellowship [NF160862]; MRC [G0800329] Funding Source: UKRI; Wellcome Trust [110157/Z/15/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust";"UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Royal Society Newton International Training Fellowship(Royal Society); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)";We thank G.

An important contributor to normal sleep patterns is a low-threshold calcium current mediated by T-type calcium channels. The T-type calcium current underlies burst responses in thalamic nuclei that are important to spindle propagation, and we recently observed that this current is sensitive to acute low doses of ethanol. Methods: We used a combination of current clamp and voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys that have chronically self-administered ethanol to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure may affect T-type currents. Results: Current clamp recordings from the LGN of ethanol naive macaques showed characteristic burst responses. However, recordings from the LGN in macaques that self-administered ethanol revealed a significant attenuation of bursts across a range of voltages (n = 5). Voltage clamp recordings from control LGN neurons (n = 16) and neurons (n = 29) from brain slices from chronically drinking macaques showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in T-type current kinetics or in the membrane resistance of the thalamic cells between the two cohorts. However, mean T-type current amplitude measured in the chronically drinking animals was reduced by 31% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure.

Pifl, S. J. Kish and O. Hornykiewicz Mov Disord. 27, 2012, 1618.]. As this noradrenaline loss was especially severe in nuclei of the motor thalamus normally transmitting basal ganglia motor output to the cortex, we hypothesized that this noradrenaline loss aggravates the motor disorder of Parkinson's disease. Here, we analysed noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin in motor (ventrolateral and ventroanterior) and non-motor (mediodorsal, centromedian, ventroposterior lateral and reticular) thalamic nuclei in MPTP-treated monkeys who were always asymptomatic; who recovered from mild parkinsonism; and monkeys with stable, either moderate or severe parkinsonism. We found that only the symptomatic parkinsonian animals had significant noradrenaline losses specifically in the motor thalamus, with the ventroanterior motor nucleus being affected only in the severe parkinsonian animals. In contrast, the striatal dopamine loss was identical in both the mild and severe symptom groups. MPTP-treatment had no significant effect on noradrenaline in non-motor thalamic nuclei or dopamine and serotonin in any thalamic subregion. We conclude that in the MPTP primate model, loss of noradrenaline in the motor thalamus may also contribute to the clinical expression of the parkinsonian motor disorder, corroborating experimentally our hypothesis on the role of thalamic noradrenaline deficit in Parkinson's disease.";"[Pifl, Christian; Hornykiewicz, Oleh] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Univ Navarra Clin, CIMA, Neurosci Div, Movement Disorders Grp, Pamplona, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Univ Navarra Clin, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Pamplona, Spain; [Blesa, Javier; Adanez, Rebeca; Obeso, Jose A.] Inst Salud Carlos III, Minist Ciencia & Innovac, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat, Madrid, Spain; [Cavada, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurociencia, Madrid, Spain; [Cavada, Carmen] Inst Invest Sanitaria IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain";"Medical University of Vienna; University of Navarra; University of Navarra; CIBERNED; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Autonomous University of Madrid";Pifl, C (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Brain Res, Spitalgasse 4, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;christian.pifl@meduniwien.ac.at;"Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020; Blesa, Javier/M-3473-2014; Blesa, Javier/GLQ-5299-2022";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Blesa, Javier/0000-0002-4257-1325; Pifl, Christian/0000-0003-1456-4264";"Plan Nacional de Investigacion [SAF2005-08416, SAF2008-04276]; UTE-CIMA; University of Navarra";"Plan Nacional de Investigacion; UTE-CIMA; University of Navarra";"We thank Ing.

A central origin of tremor could arise either from a rhythmic activity of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) or from a structure such as the thalamus, outside the basal ganglia. In this study, single-unit recordings were performed in three 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated monkeys within the GPi and within three territories of the motor thalamus (delimited by their afferent inputs from the GPi, the substantia nigra and the cerebellum, respectively). For each recorded neuron, we compared the variations in firing rate and pattern in tremor and no tremor periods. Tremor either occurred spontaneously or was induced by external stimulation. When the animals entered into a tremor period we observed: (i) an increase in the mean firing rate in about half of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus; and (ii), a change from an irregular to a rhythmic discharge within the range of tremor frequency (5-7 Hz) in about 10% of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus (pallidal and cerebellar territories) and the GPi. Most of the thalamic neurons that exhibited a rhythmic discharge during tremor were found to be sensitive to external stimulation. Because the changes in firing rate occurred predominantly in the motor thalamus and not in the GPi, and because a fast rhythmic discharge of 10-15 Hz was frequently observed in the GPi and not in the motor thalamus, we conclude that thalamic activity is not a simple reproduction of basal ganglia output. Moreover, we suggest that thalamic processing of basal ganglia outputs could participate in the genesis of tremor, and that this thalamic processing could be influenced by sensory inputs and/or changes in attentional level elicited by external stimulation.";Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, INSERM, U289, F-75651 Paris 13, France;"Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP";Tremblay, L (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux 2, Neurophysiol Lab, CNRS, UMR 5542, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France.;ltremb@ccr.jussieu.fr;"Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013; Hirsch, Etienne/AAC-7655-2019; Tremblay, Leon/H-1559-2017; Pessiglione, Mathias/E-2141-2017";"Hirsch, Etienne/0000-0003-4823-276X; Tremblay, Leon/0000-0001-8370-6903; Pessiglione, Mathias/0000-0002-6992-3677; YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X";;;;;86;58;61;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Recovered, vs. nonrecovered, patients showed an enhanced ipsileisonal thalamic-contralesional cerebellar metabolic interdependency. This pattern correctly classified 91% of recovered and 88% of nonrecovered patients. Metabolic interactions involving bilateral supplementary motor area, ipsilesional thalamus, and contralesional cerebellum distinguished all recovered patients from age/sex-matched controls (N = 12). These results suggest that altered functional interactions in thalamic circuitry may reflect plastic reorganization associated with motor recovery from hemiparesis.

A number of physiological studies have demonstrated that this projection causes a dramatic change in thalamic activity during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Additionally, the PER may mediate more subtle changes in thalamic activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state. The synaptic circuitry underlying these events has been identified in the cat thalamus. However, there is currently no anatomical information regarding the distribution of cholinergic receptors in relation to this circuitry To begin to understand how the PER projection modulates thalamic activity, we used immunocytochemical techniques to examine the distribution of muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors in the visual thalamus of the cat. The distribution of M2 receptors correlates well with previous reports of the distribution of cholinergic terminals in the visual thalamus. At the light microscopic level, dense M2 staining was seen in the neuropil of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus and in somata and proximal dendrites of cells in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). In the dLGN and pulvinar nucleus, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of M2 receptors using electron microscopy. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was used to determine whether M2 receptors are present on interneurons or thalamocortical cells. In particular, we examined the distribution of M2 receptors with respect to the known sites of PER terminations. The dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons were stained for the M2 receptors in both the glomerular and extraglomerular neuropil. However, the densest staining was found in glomerular GABAergic profiles that displayed the morphology associated with interneuron dendritic terminals (F2 profiles). Our data suggest that M2 receptors play an important role both in blocking thalamic spindle oscillations and in increasing the efficacy of signal transmission during increased attentional states.

The model consisted of 65 000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.;;;Lumer, ED (corresponding author), INST NEUROSCI,10640 JOHN JAY HOPKINS DR,SAN DIEGO,CA 92121, USA.;;Tononi, Giulio/B-8387-2009;;;;;;124;139;141;0;3;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

An anterograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline thalamus revealed strong projections to the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus. Retrograde tracer injections into these areas labeled neurons specifically in Pa. Following a retrograde tracer injection into Pa, labeled neurons were found in the hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and periaqueductal gray. Pa contained a remarkably high density of axons and axonal varicosities immunoreactive for serotonin (5-HT) and orexin/hypocretin (ORX), as well as a moderate density of fibers immunoreactive for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). A retrograde tracer injection into Pa combined with immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ORX and 5-HT axons originate from neurons in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Pa-projecting neurons were localized in the same nuclei of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain as CRH neurons, although no double labeling was found. The connections of Pa and its innervation by 5-HT, ORX, and CRH suggest that it may relay stress signals between the midbrain and hypothalamus with the accumbens nucleus, basal amygdala, and subgenual cortex as part of a circuit that manages stress and possibly stress-related psychopathologies.

Multiple retrograde tracers were placed into V1, V2, V4, and/or MT in 11 adult macaque monkeys. The inferior pulvinar (PI) was subdivided into medial (PIM), posterior (PIP), central medial (PICM), and central lateral (PICL) regions, confirming earlier CB studies. The P-1 map includes PICL and the ventromedial portion of the lateral pulvinar (PL), P-2 is found in ventrolateral PL, and P-3 includes PIP, PIM, and PICM. Projections to areas V1 and V2 were found to be overlapping in P-1 and P-2, but those from P-2 to V2 were denser than those to V1. V2 also received light projections from PICM and, less reliably, from PIM. Neurons projecting to V4 and MT were more abundant than those projecting to V1 and V2. Those projecting to V4 were observed in P-1, densely in P-2, and also in PICM and PIP of P-3. Those projecting to MT were found in P-1-P-3, with the heaviest projection from P-3. Projections from P-3 to MT and V4 were mainly interdigitated, with the densest to MT arising from PIM and the densest to V4 arising from PIP and PICM. Because the calbindin-rich and -poor regions of P-3 corresponded to differential patterns of cortical connectivity, the results suggest that CB may further delineate functional subdivisions in the pulvinar.

The experimental groups of pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were spayed controls (n = 4), estrogen treated (28 days, n = 4) and estrogen + progesterone-treated animals (14 days estrogen + 14 days estrogen and progesterone, n = 4). Monkey specific 5HT1A (432 bp), 2A (411 bp) and 2C (294 bp) receptor probes were generated with PCR. Moderate 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal was detected in the preoptic area and the ventromedial nuclei. Less intense 5HT1A receptor signal was detected in a contiguous area from the dorsomedial nuclei through the posterior hypothalamus and in the supramammillary area. There was no change in 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. Dense 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal was morphologically confined to the paraventricular, supraoptic, and mammillary nuclei and the external capsule of the thalamus. Light 5HT2A mRNA signal was inconsistently observed in the ventromedial nuclei. There was no change in the 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. The 5HT2C receptor mRNA was widely distributed in the macaque hypothalamus. The preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus were largely positive for 5HT2C mRNA with a more concentrated signal in a narrow periventricular area. Dense 5HT2C receptor signal was detected lateral to the ventromedial nuclei (capsule), in the tuberomammillary nuclei, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nuclei, infundibular area and choroid plexus. Moderate 5HT2C receptor signal was detected in the ventromedial nuclei, lateral hypothalamus and dorsal to posterior hypothalamus. There was a significant decrease in total 5HT2C mRNA hybridization signal with ovarian steroid treatment in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. In summary, macaque 5HT1A, 2A and 2C receptor mRNAs are located in distinct hypothalamic loci which play a role in a number of autonomic functions and behavior. Ovarian steroids decreased the expression of 5HT2C receptor mRNA in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. The expression of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptor mRNA was not altered by treatment with ovarian steroids. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364, '87), was analyzed by using neuroanatomical tracing, immunocytochemical, and quantitative morphometric techniques. The VL nucleus contains nerve cells of two types. Multipolar neurons (PN) retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) from the precentral gyrus display a tufted branching pattern of the proximal dendrites and have a range of soma areas from 200 to 1,000-mu-2 (mean 535.2-mu-m2, SD = 159.5). Small glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactive cells (LCN) exhibit sizes from 65 to 210-mu-m2 (mean 122.5-mu-m2, SD = 32.8) and remain unlabeled after cortical injections. The two cell types can be further distinguished by ultrastructural features. Unlike PN, LCN display little perikaryal cytoplasm, a small irregularly shaped nucleolus, and synaptic vesicles in proximal dendrites. The ratio of PN to LCN is 3:1. The LCN dendrites establish synaptic contacts on PN somata and all levels of dendritic arbor either singly or as a part of complex synaptic arrangements. They are also presynaptic to other LCN dendrites. Terminals known as LR type, i.e., large boutons containing round vesicles, are the most conspicuous in the neuropil. They form asymmetric contacts on somata and proximal dendrites of PN as well as on distal dendrites of LCN. The areas of these boutons range from 0.7 to 12-mu-m2 and the appositional length on PN dendrites ranges from 1.1 to 14-mu-m. All LR boutons except the largest ones become anterogradely labeled from large WGA-HRP injections in the deep cerebellar nuclei. These boutons are also encountered as part of triads and glomeruli, but very infrequently since the latter complex synaptic arrangements are rare. The most numerous axon terminals in the neuropil are the SR type, i.e., small terminals (mean area 0.42-mu-m2) containing round vesicles. The SR boutons become anterogradely labeled after WGA-HRP injections in the precentral gyrus. They form distinct asymmetric contacts predominantly on distal PN and LCN dendrites; however, their domain partially overlaps that of LR boutons at intermediate levels of PN dendrites. The SR boutons are components of serial synapses with LCN dendrites which, in turn, contact somata and all levels of dendritic arbors of PN. They also participate in complex arrangements that consist of sequences of LCN dendrites, serial synapses, and occasional boutons with symmetric contacts. These structures termed small glomeruli are much more frequent in the monkey VL than classic glomeruli with LR boutons. The third group is composed of boutons known as F1 type. This is a heterogeneous population containing boutons of varying sizes ranging from 0.4 to 9-mu-m2. The terminals contain pleomorphic or almost cylindrical vesicles and display symmetric contacts. The F1 boutons form axosomatic and axodendritic synapses on both types of cells, and axoaxonic synapses on initial axon segments of PN. It is these boutons that participate in complex synaptic arrangements with vesicle-containing LCN dendrites and SR boutons, and they are also encountered as part of triads with three symmetric contacts. Representatives of this bouton population display positive GAD immunoreactivity. For measurements of the membrane and apposing structures, the identified PN dendrites were grouped into three categories. The group of secondary dendrites included all consecutive-order short dendritic segments within approximately a 60-mu-m radius around the soma where most of the branching occurred. It was found that the ratios of boutons with asymmetric contacts to those with symmetric contacts were 4:1 on primary dendrites, 9:1 on secondary, and 55:1 on distal dendrites. The ratios of symmetric dendrodendritic synapses to symmetric contacts formed by axon terminals were 3:1 on primary and  secondary dendrites and 1:1 on distal dendrites. This suggests the overall predominance of excitatory inputs (LR and SR boutons) on PN dendrites with inhibitory inputs coming mainly from GABAergic LCN dendrites. Comparison of the present findings with earlier data on the cerebellar thalamic territory in the cat and the nigrothalamic territory in the monkey suggests significant interspecies and internuclear differences in the organization of motor thalamic circuits.";;;KULTASILINSKY, K (corresponding author), UNIV IOWA, COLL MED, DEPT ANAT, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS24188] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;83;56;56;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

After HRP injections into the head of the caudate nucleus we found retrogradely labelled neurons mainly in the intralaminar nuclei (nc. paracentralis, nc. centralis lateralis, nc. parafascicularis) and in the midline nuclei (nc. parataenialis, nc. centralis pars densocellularis, nc. centralis superior, nc. centralis intermedialis, nc. centralis inferior, nc. reuniens). Some labelled neurons were seen in the anterior thalamic nuclei (nc. anterodorsalis, nc. anteromedialis, nc. anteroventralis). In the ventral thalamus labelled neurons were seen in the nc. ventralis anterior (pars magnocellularis) and in the nc. ventralis lateralis (pars medialis). Some labelled neurons were distributed in the marginal parts of the nc. mediodorsalis. As for the caudal portion of the thalamus, labelled neurons were found in the nc. pulvinaris medialis and nc. limitans. The thalamocaudate projection is an exclusively ipsilateral projection system. The position of the thalamocaudate neurons coincides, to a certain degree, with the termination intrathalamic area of the nigrothalamic and tectothalamic projections arising from the deep layers of the superior colliculus.;"CHARLES UNIV, FAC MED 3, INST PHYSIOL, CS-11636 PRAGUE 1, CZECHOSLOVAKIA; REG HOSP, DEPT NEUROSURG, USTI NAD LABEM, CZECHOSLOVAKIA";Charles University Prague;DRUGA, R (corresponding author), CHARLES UNIV, FAC MED 1, INST ANAT, U NEMOCNICE 3, CS-12800 PRAGUE 2, CZECHOSLOVAKIA.;;"Druga, Rastislav/H-1179-2014; Benes, Vladimir/M-4755-2017; Rokyta, Richard/A-9423-2017";"Druga, Rastislav/0000-0003-3947-8522; Benes, Vladimir/0000-0002-6889-857X; ";;;;;50;13;13;0;4;AKAD VERLAG GMBH;BERLIN;PALISADENSTR 40, D-10243 BERLIN, GERMANY;0021-8359;;;J HIRNFORSCH;;;1991;32;6;;;;;765;774;;;;;;10;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;HW075;1821422;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991HW07500011;View Full Record in Web of Science

The DCS is of interest because of its role in directed attention and recovery from multimodal hemispatial neglect following cortical lesions of medial agranular cortex (AGm), an association area that is its major source of cortical input. A key finding was that the multimodal posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also contributes substantial input to DCS. This is significant because PPC and AGm are linked by corticocortical connections and are both critical components of the circuitry involved in spatial processing and directed attention. Other cortical areas providing input to DCS include visual association areas, lateral agranular cortex and orbital cortex. These areas also have reciprocal connections with AGm and PPC. Less consistent labeling was seen in somatic sensorimotor areas FL, HL and Par 1. Thalamic afferents to DCS are prominent from the intralaminar, ventrolateral, mediodorsal, ventromedial, laterodorsal (LD) and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. Collectively, these nuclei constitute the sources of thalamic input to cortical areas AGm, and PPC. Nuclei LD and LP are only labeled with injections in dorsal DCS, the site of major input from PPC, and PPC receives its thalamic input from LD and LP. We conclude that DCS receives inputs from cortical and thalamic areas that are themselves linked by corticocortical and thalamocortical connections. These findings support the hypothesis that DCS is a key component of an associative network of cortical, striatal and thalamic regions involved in multimodal processing and directed attention.

However, little is known about the histaminergic innervation of visual areas, or the histamine system in the primate brain, in general. We examined in Macaca mulatta the location of histamine-immunoreactive neurons and the innervation of important-cortical and subcortical visual areas by histamine-immunoreactive axons. Brain sections were treated with an antibody to histamine and processed with standard immunohistological procedures. Histamine-immunoreactive neurons (20-45 mu m in diameter) were localized bilaterally in the hypothalamus, particularly in ventral, lateral, posterior, and perimammillary hypothalamic areas. These hypothalamic cells appear to provide the sole neural source of histamine in the macaque brain. A plexus of varicose histamine-immunoreactive axons was present throughout the superior colliculus, the dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the lateral posterior/pulvinar complex, and the visual cortex, including areas 17, 18, and the nearby extrastriate cortex. The axons nearly homogeneously innervated every region and layer in these structures, except for an increase in density in layer 1 of the visual cortex and in the superficial-most layers of the superior colliculus. Histaminergic axons broadly innervated every visual region examined. In comparison with the other aminergic and the cholinergic projection systems, which show considerable projection specificity, the histaminergic projection exhibited great homogeneity. The breadth of the distribution of histaminergic axons ensures that virtually all levels of visual processing in the primate can be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the neuromodulatory effects of histamine.

The inferior pulvinar (PI) complex consisted of multiple subdivisions and encompassed the classic PI, and adjacent ventral parts of the lateral and medial pulvinar (PL and Phl, respectively). In keeping with nomenclature suggested previously for macaques, the PI subdivisions were termed the posterior, medial, central, lateral, and lateral-shell (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S). In both species, PIP was intense for calbindin, light for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and very light for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) histochemistry. The PIM was calbindin poor, AChE rich, and moderate for WFA. The PIC was calbindin intense, lighter for AChE, and exhibited little WFA binding. PIL and PIL-S contained populations of large calbindin or WFA cells that were more numerous in PIL-S. Although staining with the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 differed between macaques and squirrel monkeys, the same subdivisions were displayed, Moderately dense, patchy Cat-301 stain was found in PIM of macaques, whereas in squirrel monkeys PIM was Light. Connections of the rostral dorsolateral (DLr) and middle temporal (MT) areas of visual cortex in squirrel monkeys were compared with PI subdivisions revealed by the neu er histochemical methods in the same cases. The major connections of DLr were with PIC and of MT were with PIM.

In 75% of the trials the visual cue correctly indicated which of the 2 acoustic signals would follow. In 25% of the trials the visual cue was misleading, readying for the wrong acoustic signal. Based on the visual cue the monkey could anticipate which acoustic signal would be presented, a possibility confirmed by behavioural analysis. Movements conforming with the acoustic instruction signals were reinforced. The activity of 65 medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and 107 primary auditory cortex (Acx) neurons was recorded during task performance. Significant response differences to anticipated vs unanticipated acoustic signals were found in 32% of the MGN and 27% of the ACx neurons. In both structures some of the affected neurons responded more vigorously to the correctly anticipated acoustic signals while others responded more vigorously to the unanticipated ones. An index of relative response intensity (RRI) was derived for each neuron by comparing its response to the sound signal in reinforced trials with that obtained in trials with no visual cues and no reinforcement (a 'blank' condition). For both MGN and ACx the analysis of RRIs revealed two anticipation-related effects. One consisted of response facilitation to anticipated sound signals together with suppression of responses to unanticipated sound signals. The other consisted of facilitation of responses to unanticipated sound signals, combined with base-line responsiveness to anticipated sounds. These effects can be interpreted to reflect a context-relevant trial by trial selection of neuronal channels which conduct information along the thalamocortical segment of the auditory system. The similarity between the effects of anticipation at the thalamic and the cortical levels suggest that the changes in excitability which underlay trial by trial neuronal selectivity occur subcortically.;UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,BRAIN RES INST,NEUROSCI PROGRAM,LOS ANGELES,CA 90024;"University of California System; University of California Los Angeles";HOCHERMAN, S (corresponding author), TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL,FAC MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,POB 9649,IL-31096 HAIFA,ISRAEL.;;Yirmiya, Raz/D-1090-2014;Yirmiya, Raz/0000-0002-4009-7316;;;;;28;10;10;0;3;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0006-8950;;;BRAIN;Brain;DEC;1990;113;;6;;;;1707;1720;;10.1093/brain/113.6.1707;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/113.6.1707;;;14;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;EP889;2276042;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1990EP88900006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Post-mortem anatomic studies have rarely investigated the thalamus in this population. Methods: Postmortem tissue was obtained from the left hemisphere of eight male schizophrenic patients and eight male age-matched control subjects, The optical dissector stereologic procedure was used to count neurons in the mediodorsal (MD) and anteroventral/anteromedial (AV/AM) nuclei of the thalamus. Results: The number of neurons and volume of the MD were significantly reduced by 35% and 24%, respectively. The MD cell number reduction was a consistent finding; every control subject had more and every schizophrenic subject had fewer than 3.5 million neurons. Neuron number was also significantly reduced (16%) in the AV/AM nuclei. Conclusions: The present data indicate that schizophrenia is associated with robust reductions in nerve cell numbers in nuclei that communicate with the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. These thalamic anatomic deficits may be responsible, in part, for previous reports of such prefrontal cortical abnormalities as reduced synaptic density, reduced volume, and metabolic hypofunction.

Action selection in the face of dynamic reward associations requires several cognitive processes: registering a change in value of the primary reinforcer, adjusting the value of secondary reinforcers to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer, and guiding action selection to optimal choices. Flexible responding has been evaluated extensively using reinforcer devaluation tasks. Performance on this task relies upon amygdala, Areas 11 and 13 of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Differential contributions of amygdala and Areas 11 and 13 of OFC to specific sub-processes have been established, but the role of MD in these sub-processes is unknown. Pharmacological inactivation of the macaque MD during specific phases of this task revealed that MD is required for reward valuation and action selection. This profile is unique, differing from both amygdala and subregions of the OFC.;"[Wicker, Evan; Malkova, Ludise; Forcelli, Patrick A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Turchi, Janita] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bldg 9, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Malkova, Ludise; Forcelli, Patrick A.] Georgetown Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Neurosci, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Forcelli, Patrick A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC 20057 USA";"Georgetown University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Georgetown University; Georgetown University";"Forcelli, PA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Forcelli, PA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Neurosci, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Forcelli, PA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC 20057 USA.";paf22@georgetown.edu;Forcelli, Patrick A/G-6970-2012;"Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X; Wicker, Evan/0000-0003-4242-7849";"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [KL2TR001432]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH099505]";"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences KL2TR001432 Patrick Alexander Forcelli.; National Institute of Mental Health R01MH099505 Ludise Malkova.";;30;14;14;0;4;ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD;CAMBRIDGE;SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND;2050-084X;;;ELIFE;eLife;MAY 31;2018;7;;;;;;;;e37325;10.7554/eLife.37325;http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37325;;;14;Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics;GJ9GT;29848447;Green Published, gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000435707900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about possible structural alterations following amputation and chronic loss of afferent input in humans. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), based on high-resolution magnetic resonance images, we investigated the brain structure of 28 volunteers with unilateral limb amputation and compared them to healthy controls. Subjects with limb amputation exhibited a decrease in gray matter of the posterolateral thalamus contralateral to the side of the amputation. The thalamic gray matter differences were positively correlated with the time span after the amputation but not with the frequency or magnitude of coexisting phantom pain. Phantom limb pain was unrelated to thalamic structural variations, but was positively correlated to a decrease in brain areas related to the processing of pain. No gray matter increase was detected. The unilateral thalamic differences may reflect a structural correlate of the loss of afferent input as a secondary change following deafferentation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report a quantitative retrograde tracer analysis in the cynomolgus macaque monkey of the weight consistency of the afferents of cortical areas across brains via calculation of a weight index (fraction of labeled neurons, FLN). Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3% cumulative FLN), high local intrinsic connectivity (80% FLN), high-input form neighboring areas (15% cumulative FLN), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3% cumulative FLN). Corticocortical FLN values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low FLN values.;"[Markov, N.

Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to the motor cortex, In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the lateral and interposed nuclei to the thalamus in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei. Terminals from the lateral nucleus were found to be located most medially in the thalamus, predominantly in the ventral lateral nucleus and the rostral pole of the posterior nuclear group. Terminals from the posterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the lateral nucleus, mainly around the border between the ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Terminals from the anterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the posterior interposed nucleus, predominantly in the rostral pole of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus. Terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei were also found in double anterograde-tracing experiments to be nonoverlapping in the regions between these main areas of termination. The structure of terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with thalamic neurones, were found to be similar. The terminals are large and form synapses with proximal dendrites of thalamic neurones. They contained round vesicles and formed multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, as well as dendritic spines. The findings indicate that information from the lateral and interposed nuclei is processed in separate regions of the thalamus but that the mode of synaptic transfer to thalamic neurones is likely to be similar for the two projections.

Using the Northern blot analysis, we investigated the developmental changes of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the thalamus of macaque monkeys. The amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was high at embryonic day 125, and decreased at postnatal day 1. It increased again at postnatal day 8, reached its peak value at postnatal days 50-70, and then decreased gradually until postnatal year 1. We previously reported that the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA in the cerebral cortex decreased roughly exponentially during perinatal and postnatal periods and that it approached the asymptote by postnatal day 70 [Oishi T, Higo N, Umino Y, Matsuda K, Hayashi M (1998) Development of GAP-43 mRNA in the macaque cerebral cortex. Dev Brain Res 109:87-97]. The present findings may indicate that extensive synaptic growth of thalamic neurons continues even after that of cortical neurons has finished. We then performed in situ hybridization to investigate whether the expression level of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was different among various thalamic nuclei. In the infant thalamus (postnatal days 70-90), moderate to intense expression of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA was detected in all thalamic nuclei. Quantitative analysis in the infant thalamus indicated that the expression levels were different between the nuclear groups that are defined by the origin of their afferents. The expression in the first order nuclei, which receive their primary afferent fibers from ascending pathways [Guillery RW (1995) Anatomical evidence concerning the role of the thalamus in corticocortical communication: a brief review. J Anat 187 (Pt 3):583-592], was significantly higher than that in the higher order nuclei. While moderate expression was also detected in the adult dorsal thalamus, the expression in the first order nuclei was almost the same as that in the higher order nuclei. Thus, the in situ hybridization experiments indicated that the transient postnatal increase in the amount of growth-associated protein-43 mRNA, which was shown by the Northern blot analysis, was mainly attributed to enhanced expression in the first order nuclei during the postnatal period. This may be a molecular basis for environmentally induced modification of thalamocortical synapses.

Methods: Twenty-six patients with mTLE who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy were included. Post-operatively, 13 patients became completely seizure-free and 13 showed residual seizure, regardless of frequency (five patients became almost seizure-free, six had rare seizures and two showed significant improvements). Degrees of hypometabolism in bilateral thalamus, ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal lobes were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively by determining the asymmetry index (AI), a value indicating 100 x (ipsilateral-contralateral)/[1/2x ( ipsilateral + contralateral)] and the region-to-cerebral hemisphere ratio (R/C ratio) being the ratio between averaged counts in each area and those in the cerebral hemisphere of the same side. Results: Hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe was visually observed in all patients. Hypometabolism in the lateral temporal lobe was observed in 20 patients and was semiquantitatively more prominent than that of the medial temporal lobe. Pathologically, hippocampal sclerosis and prominent astrogliosis of the lateral temporal lobe were present in all cases. However, while thalamic hypometabolism was visually observed in nine patients (in the ipsilateral side of four cases, contralateral side of three and on both sides of two), no significant thalamic hypometabolism was semi-quantitatively observed. No significant differences in metabolic rate in any area except for the lateral temporal lobe between seizure-free patients and residual seizure patients were seen semi-quantitatively. Discussion: Data indicated that metabolism in the lateral temporal lobe of patients with mTLE significantly decreased and revealed pathologic glial changes. Thalamic hypometabolism was quite mild and did not correlate with post-operative seizure outcome.;"Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Clin Radiol, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan";"Kyushu University; Kyushu University";Morioka, T (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.;takato@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp;"Yoshida, Fumiaki/AAL-2140-2021; Yoshida, Fumiaki/D-2511-2013";Miyagi, Yasushi/0000-0002-1241-0838;;;;;50;15;18;0;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0161-6412;1743-1328;;NEUROL RES;Neurol.

These projections form core components of the Papez circuit, which is vital for normal memory. The study revealed a complex pattern of subicular efferents, consistent with the presence of different, parallel information streams, whose segregation appears more marked in the rat brain. In both species, the cells projecting to the mammillary bodies and anterior thalamic nuclei showed laminar separation but also differed along other hippocampal axes. In the rat, these diencephalic inputs showed complementary topographies in the proximal-distal (columnar) plane, consistent with differential involvement in object-based (proximal subiculum) and context-based (distal subiculum) information. The medial mammillary inputs, which arose along the anterior-posterior extent of the rat subiculum, favoured the central subiculum (septal hippocampus) and the more proximal subiculum (temporal hippocampus). In contrast, anterior thalamic inputs were largely confined to the dorsal (i.e. septal and intermediate) subiculum, where projections to the anteromedial nucleus favoured the proximal subiculum while those to the anteroventral nucleus predominantly arose in the distal subiculum. In the macaque, the corresponding diencephalic inputs were again distinguished by anterior-posterior topographies, as subicular inputs to the medial mammillary bodies predominantly arose from the posterior hippocampus while subicular inputs to the anteromedial thalamic nucleus predominantly arose from the anterior hippocampus.

Schizophrenia is associated with reductions in thalamic neuronal number and cortical gray matter volume. Exposure of nonhuman primates to x-irradiation in early gestation has previously been shown to decrease thalamic volume and neuronal number. Here we examine whether early gestational irradiation also results in cortical volume reduction. Methods: High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult monkeys 1) exposed to irradiation during the early gestational period (E33-E42) corresponding to thalamic neurogenesis, 2) irradiated in midgestation (E70-81) during neocortical neurogenesis, and 3) not exposed to irradiation. Cortical gray matter and white matter volumes were derived via manual segmentation, frontal and nonfrontal volumes were distinguisbed via sulcal landmarks. Results: Monkeys irradiated in early gestation exhibited a trend reduction in nonfrontal gray matter volume (17%) and significant reductions in white matter volume in frontal (26%) and nonfrontal (36%) lobes. Monkeys irradiated in midgestation had smaller gray (frontal 28%; nonfrontal. 22% and white matter (frontal 29%; nonfrontal- 38%) volumes. Conclusions: The cortical deficits observed in midgestationally irradiated monkeys are consistent with a reduction in cortical neuronal number. Cortical volume reductions following early gestational irradiation may be secondary to reduced thalamic neuronal number and therefore model the thalamocortical pathology of schizophrenia.";"Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";"Yale University; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)";Selemon, LD (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, POB 208001, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;ldselemon@aol.com;"Nebel, Mary Beth/D-3305-2015; wang, le/HKN-3406-2023; Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013";"Nebel, Mary Beth/0000-0003-0185-3382; Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388";NIMH NIH HHS [MH 59329, P20 MH062130, R01 MH059329, MH 62130, MH 071616, P50 MH071616, MH 44866] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;98;26;27;1;5;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0006-3223;1873-2402;;BIOL PSYCHIAT;Biol.

Lamina I terminations were identified by anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran, and 109 boutons on 38 terminal fibers were closely studied in series of ultrathin sections. Five unlabeled terminal boutons of similar appearance were also examined in detail. Three-dimensional, volume-rendered computer models were reconstructed from complete series of serial sections for 29 boutons on 10 labeled terminal fibers and one unlabeled terminal fiber. In addition, postembedding immunogold staining for GABA was obtained in alternate sections through 23 boutons. Lamina I TSTT terminations in VMpo generally have several large boutons (mean length = 2.16 mum, mean width = 1.29 mum) that are densely packed with vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts on low-order dendrites of VMpo neurons (mean diameter 1.45 mum). They are closely associated with GABAergic presynaptic dendrites (PSDs), and nearly all form classic triadic arrangements (28 of 29 reconstructed boutons). Consecutive boutons on individual terminal fibers make multiple contacts with a single postsynaptic dendrite and can show evidence of progressive complexity. Dendritic appendages that enwrap and invaginate the terminal bouton constitute additional anatomic evidence for secure, high-fidelity synaptic transfer. These observations provide direct ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that VMpo is a lamina I TSTT thalamocortical relay nucleus in primates that subserves pain, temperature, itch, and other sensations related to the physiological condition of the body.

Previ-ous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of age in rhesus macaque brains have been prone to low statistical power, unbalanced sex ratio and lack of a complete age range. To overcome these problems, the current study surveyed structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 66 animals, 34 females (aged 6-31 years) and 32 males (aged 5-27 years). Differences observed in older animals, in-cluded enlargement of the lateral ventricles and a smaller volume in the frontal cortex, caudate, puta-men, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Unexpected, greater volume, were measured in older animals in the hippocampus, amygdala, and globus pallidus. There were also numerous differences between males and females with respect to age in both white and gray matter regions. As an apparent model of normative human aging, the macaque is ideal for studying induction and mitigation of neurodegenerative disease.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Thalamic afferent terminals are preferentially labeled by an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2. The goal of our study was to determine the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in macaque and human visual cortex. First, we investigated the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in all layers of macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1), and found a very close correspondence between the known distribution of LGN afferents from previous studies and the distribution of VGluT2-immunoreactive (-ir) puncta. There was also a close correspondence between cytochrome oxidase density and VGluT2-ir puncta distribution. After validating the correspondence in macaque, we made a comparative study in human V1. In many aspects, the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in human was qualitatively similar to that of the macaque: high densities in layer 4C, patches of VGluT2-ir puncta in the supragranular layer (2/3), lower but clear distribution in layers 1 and 6, and very few puncta in layers 5 and 4B. However, there were also important differences between macaques and humans. In layer 4A of human, there was a sparse distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta, whereas in macaque, there was a dense distribution with the characteristic honeycomb organization. The results suggest important changes in the pattern of cortical VGluT2 immunostaining that may be related to evolutionary differences in the cortical organization of LGN afferents between Old World monkeys and humans.

Material was obtained from brains cut in the frontal, horizontal, and parasagittal planes. Our results indicate that the ventrolateral thalamic region (VL) of owl monkeys is a heterogeneous structure composed of several architectonic subdivisions that resemble divisions that have been described in macaques and other Old World anthropoids. All of these subdivisions are more readily distinguished in AChE than in Nissl or CO preparations. The anterior part of VL, VLa (VLo of Olszewski), is characterized by clusters of medium-sized, darkly stained neurons. VLa is also distinguished by AChE-positive cells embedded in a matrix of neurites as well as by a characteristic dark, irregular net of blood vessels. The posterior part of VL is rather uniform cytoarchitectonically and contains large, darkly stained, and sparsely distributed neurons. However, we were able to distinguish three subdivisions of posterior VL that closely correspond to structures described by Olszewski in macaques: a principal segment, VLp (VPLo of Olszewski), a medial segment; VLx (''area X'' of Olszewski), and a dorsal segment, VLd (VLc and VLps of Olszewski). In AChE, VLd is much darker than the other divisions. The distinction between VLp and VLx, which together make up the largest part of VL, is less marked, although VLp is somewhat darker and more irregular in appearance in AChE than is VLx.

The labeled neurons were remarkably similar in most measured parameters including the number of dendrites (7.5 +/- 1.2), percentage of dichotomous branching (89.8% +/- 3.4), and contribution of terminal branches to total dendritic length (88.4% +/- 2.0). The individual dendrites ranged in total length from 443 mum to 7,657 mum with a mean of 2,346 mum (+/- 137, n = 98). There was a positive correlation between stem dendrite diameter and total dendrite length, making it possible to estimate the total size of an individual dendrite by measuring the stem dendrite diameter. There was only a small increase in mean path distance with increasing dendritic size at the whole neuron and individual dendritic levels, so that for individual dendrites the mean path distance of a dendrite consisting of only two segments was 199 mum, while the mean path distance for a dendrite with eight segments was only 45 mum longer. Analysis of dendrite diameter, segment order, and path distance shows that dendritic diameter is not reliable for determining the location of synaptic contacts viewed by electron microscopy onto dendritic trees. The small variation of measured parameters between these neurons presents a powerful tool for future developmental, plasticity and comparative studies of VB neurons.

To determine whether its anatomical abnormalities may be associated with cognitive deficits in the onset of schizophrenia, we assessed thalamic Volume, shape, white matter integrity, and their correlations with cognition in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. T1-weighted magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor (DT) images were collected in 49 healthy comparison controls (CON) and 32 patients with FES (FES). Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithms were used to delineate and assess the thalamic shape from MRI scans. The thalamic white matter integrity was quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) averaged over the thalamus using DTI. Our analysis revealed that FES did not differ from CON in FA and MID but did differ markedly from them in the thalamic volume and shape. Patients with FES also performed poorly in spatial working memory and executive tasks. The correlation study found that regional thalamic shapes highly correlate with the two cognitive scores in the entire sample and healthy comparison controls but not in patients with FES even though no correlation was found between the thalamic volumes with the two cognitive scores in any group. Left thalamic FA was correlated with spatial working memory deficits in FES. Our findings suggest that thalamic Volume and shape abnormalities are evident at the onset of FES prior to thalamic abnormal white matter integrity. Altered microstructural white matter integrity assessed using DTI may not be apparent in FES but may be observed as the disease progresses. Cognitive deficits related to spatial working memory and executive functioning in FES were observed in the context of loss of their normal relationship with the thalamic shapes, that is, regionally-specific thalamic shape compression is associated with poor performance in executive functioning and spatial working memory.

The analysis was carried out on coronal brain sections taken through the hippocampus and thalamus at the level of the geniculate nuclei. High densities of beta-amyloid protein precursor(695) and beta-amyloid protein precursor(751) messenger RNAs were found in the medial aspects of the mediodorsal, centromedian and parafascicular nuclei of the 17-year-old monkeys. The messenger RNA levels of the 695 and 751 isoforms were about two- and seven-fold, respectively, those found in the same nuclei of the three-year-old animals. The levels of these messenger RNA transcripts in the 17-year-old monkeys were not significantly different from those in the three-year-old animals in other brain areas e.g. the temporal cortex, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. No Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology in terms of diffuse or senile beta-amyloid plaques, dystrophic neurites or neurofibrillary tangles were detectable by specific innumohistochemical procedures in the above thalamic nuclei of the 17-year-old animals. In addition no reactive gliosis was seen in the thalamus of these monkeys. The presence of increased levels of beta-amyloid protein precursor(695) and beta-amyloid protein precursor(751) messenger RNAs and the absence of any Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in the thalamus of the middle-aged monkeys may suggest that enhanced transcription of the beta-amyloid protein precursor gene may precede by many years any manifestation of the beta-amyloid protein accumulation/deposition. The data obtained in the thalamus of the 17-year-old monkeys may be indicative of early molecular events associated with the aging process.;;;SIRINATHSINGHJI, DJS (corresponding author), MERCK SHARP & DOHME LTD,RES LABS,CTR RES NEUROSCI,TERLINGS PK,HARLOW CM20 2QR,ESSEX,ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;34;15;15;0;2;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;MAR;1995;65;1;;;;;51;57;;10.1016/0306-4522(94)00485-N;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(94)00485-N;;;7;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;QH292;7753407;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1995QH29200006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The trichromatic system of Old-World monkeys and humans has relatively few S-cones in the fovea. In this study, we investigated the distribution of putative S-cone afferents in macaques primary visual cortex (V1) which form a characteristic honeycomb arrangement in layer 4A. It was hypothesized that if there were a low number of S-cone opponent projecting neurons in central vision then this would be seen as a reduction in afferents in foveal layer 4A. Recent studies have shown that the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) is a marker for thalamic afferent terminals in cortex. The distribution of VGlut2-immunoreactive (-ir) terminals was studied in the foveal and perifoveal representation of V1. It was found that there was a substantial reduction in the terminal density in the foveal representation: the density was 5-6 times lower in the foveal V1 than in regions representing perifoveal eccentricities of 1A degrees-2A degrees and beyond. These findings may provide the cortical substrate of foveal tritanopia, the reduced blue perceptual ability for small fields in the center of gaze.;"[Garcia-Marin, Virginia; Sundiang, Marina; Hawken, Michael J.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA";New York University;Hawken, MJ (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;mjh2@nyu.edu;Garcia-Marin, Virginia/HTP-8168-2023;Garcia-Marin, Virginia/0009-0009-7518-8179;"NIH [EY17945, P30EY013079]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation [EX2009-0636]";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Spanish Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation(Spanish Government)";This work was supported by NIH grants EY17945 and P30EY013079.

Using stereological techniques in six pairs of individually matched brains from schizophrenics and controls, we measured the volumes and obtained estimates of the number of neurons in the three subnuclei (parvocellular, pc; densocellular, dc; magnocellular, mc) of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and from the ventral posterior medial nucleus.

To study the possible pathogenesis, an animal model of neurodevelopmental thalamic damage has been developed by applying low-dose radiation to rhesus monkeys in early gestation. Irradiated monkeys sacrificed as infants demonstrate neuronal losses in specific thalamic nuclei and decreases in cortical neuropil. Methods: Magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult Rhesus monkeys exposed to irradiation daring thalamic neurogenesis (E33-42), after thalamic neurogenesis (E70-81), and in nonirradiated control animals. High dimensional brain mapping was used to compare thalamic volumes and shape characteristics in the three groups of animals. Results: Animals exposed to irradiation at E33-42 showed a significant bilateral loss of thalamic volumes (> 20%) compared with controls and with animals irradiated at E70-81 when total brain volume was used as a covariate in the analysis. Thalamic volume loss was associated with a nonuniform deformation of thalamic shape. Conclusions: A first-trimester, neurodevelopmental insult in the nonhuman primate during thalamic neurogenesis produces a complex pattern of thalamic volume loss and shape deformation in adulthood. Low-dose irradiation of the fetal primate may be useful for modeling key features of the pathology described in schizophrenic patients.

A previous study at the electron microscopic level in cat anterior TRN has suggested that synchronous bursting activity could result from the large number of presumably GABAergic dendrodendritic synaptic contacts. However, little is known about the synaptology of the monkey thalamic reticular nucleus and whether it contains dendrodendritic contacts. To address this issue, we examined tissue obtained from Macaca fascicularis that was prepared for electron microscopy using postembedding techniques to demonstrate GABA immunoreactivity. Examination of the anterior (motor) and posterior (somatosensory) portions of the TRN disclosed the following: The majority of synaptic contacts (87.5% of 958) were formed by axon terminals showing no GABA immunoreactivity and making asymmetric synaptic contacts on dendrites or cell bodies. A further 6.4% of synaptic contacts was composed of GABA-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals making symmetric contacts with the dendrites of TRN neurons. The majority resembled the pleomorphic vesicle containing F-terminals seen in the dorsal thalamus and known to originate from axons of TRN. A subset or possible second class did not resemble any previously described class of GABA-immunoreactive terminals in the TRN. Both classes of these terminals making symmetric contacts may originate wholly or partially within the nucleus. There was one dendrodendritic synaptic contact and only a small number (3.2%) of axodendritic contacts with synaptic vesicles visible both pre- and postsynaptically. We conclude that dendrodendritic contacts are probably not responsible for the synchronized bursting neuronal activity seen in the slow-wave sleep of monkeys, and that, if TRN neurons are coupled synaptically, the most likely mechanism is through the synapses formed by recurrent axon collaterals of TRN neurons onto TRN dendrites.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the DMFC has a topographic map coding final eye position, and to ascertain whether this region subserves the maintenance of eye position. The DMFC was stimulated electrically while monkeys fixated a target presented somewhere in visual space. A series of parametric tests was conducted to ascertain the best stimulation parameters to evoke saccades. Electrical stimulation typically produced contraversive saccades that converged onto a region of space, the termination zone. For some stimulation sites, however, stimulation produced ipsiversive saccades. This occurred when the termination zone was located straight ahead of the monkey. Convergence onto an orbital position was never observed during stimulation of the frontal eye fields (FEF), stimulation of which evoked fixed-vector saccades. The latency to evoke a saccade from the DMFC varied with fixation position, such that it increased monotonically the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. Moreover, the probability of evoking a saccade from the DMFC decreased the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. The latency for evoking a saccade and the probability of evoking a saccade from the FEF did not vary with fixation position. Horizontal head movements were not evoked from the DMFC while a monkey fixated targets presented in different positions of visual space. Moveover, changing the position of the head with respect to the body did not change the location of a termination zone with respect to the head. The DMFC was found to contain a topographic coding of termination zones, with rostral sites representing zones in extreme contralateral visual space, and caudal sites representing zones straight ahead or ipsilaterally. Furthermore, lateral sites represented zones in upper visual space, whereas medial sites represented zones in lower visual space. Once the eyes were positioned within a termination zone, further stimulation fixed the gaze and inhibited visually evoked saccades. Following release from inhibition, which occurred shortly after the end of stimulation, the saccades reached the visual target accurately. This shows that the stimulation delayed the execution of the saccades without actually aborting their execution. We conclude that the DMFC contains a map representing eye position in craniotopic coordinates, and we argue that this map is utilized to maintain eye position.;;;TEHOVNIK, EJ (corresponding author), MIT, DEPT BRAIN & COGNIT SCI, E25-634, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA.;;Lee, Kyoung Min/J-2775-2012;;;;;;54;108;108;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

In each experiment, single or multiple injections of various retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into adjacent regions or areas. In two experiments, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the lateral pulvinar, respectively. The results show that the thalamo-cortical projection from LGN to striate cortex and from pulvinar to the prestriate cortex are similarly organized, but the geniculo-striate projection is more precise than the pulvinar-prestriate projection. The pulvinar-prestriate projection is topographically organized and preserves topological neighbourhood relations. Projection zones to the various visual areas are concentrically wrapped around each other. The projection zone to area 18 constitutes a central core region. It begins ventro-laterally in PuL where the pulvinar is in contact with the LGN. This contact zone we called the hilus region of the pulvinar. The area 18-projection zone stretches as a central cone into the posterior pulvinar through PuL and into PuM. It is surrounded by the projection zone to the posterior belt of area 19 and this in turn is surrounded by the projection zone to the anterior belt of area 19. The projection zones to area 19 are then surrounded medially and dorsally by zones projectiong to the temporal and parietal association cortex, respectively. The projection zone to area MT is located medio-ventrally in the posterior pulvinar (PuIP and surrounding nuclei) and coincides with a densely myelinated region. Area 17 also receives input from the pulvinar but probably predominantly in the region of the central visual field. The pulvinar zone projecting to area 17 is located ventrolaterally from the central core region projecting to area 18 and is contiguous laterally with the LGN. If the positions of the vertical and the horizontal meridian in the pulvinar correspond to those in the respective cortical projection zones, a second order visual field representation such as found in area 18, with the horizontal meridian split at an excentricity of about 7-10-degrees, can also be recognized in the pulvinar.;MAX PLANCK INST BIOPHYS CHEM, DEPT NEUROBIOL, POB 2841, W-3400 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY;Max Planck Society;;;;;;;;;66;35;35;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Although the two receptor subtypes show a markedly different distribution in the rat brain, their distribution in the primate brain has not been described previously. In this study, the neuroanatomic distribution of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor binding sites in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was assessed by using iodine 125 ([I-125)-Tyr(0)] -sauvagine with or without the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP-154,526-1. Radiolabeled human cRNA probes were used to map the distribution of the two receptor mRNAs with in situ hybridization. Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were found in the pituitary and throughout the neocortex (especially, in prefrontal, cingulate, striate, and insular cortices), amygdala, and hippocampal formation of the monkey brain. This is in contrast to the distribution of these receptors reported in the rat brain, in which generally only the CRF1 receptor is found in the pituitary and neocortex. These results suggest that, in primates, both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of CRF on cognition, behavior, and pituitary-adrenal function. The presence of CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptors within the locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamus, and striatum and of CRF2 (but not CRF1) receptors in the choroid plexus, certain hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus prepositus, and the nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests that each receptor subtype also may have distinct functional roles within the primate central nervous system.

Sensory information is believed to then propagate through the cortical column along the L4 -> L2/3 -> L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent strata of cortex in parallel.;"[Bruno, Randy M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Columbia University; Columbia University";Bruno, RM (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.;randybruno@columbia.edu;Bruno, Randy M./ABC-2117-2021;Bruno, Randy M./0000-0002-5122-4632;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH [NS069679]; Rita Allen Foundation; Klingenstein Fund; NSF Student Fellowship";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Rita Allen Foundation; Klingenstein Fund(Klingenstein Philanthropies); NSF Student Fellowship";"We thank L.

The thalamus also receives inputs from basal ganglia nuclei (BG) involved in value-based decision making, suggesting a role in the value process. We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning. Our data indicate that single neurons in the posterior thalamus not only processed simple visual information but also represented historical values. Furthermore, our data suggest an SC-posterior thalamus-BG-SC subcortical loop circuit that encodes the historical value, enabling a quick automatic gaze by bypassing the visual cortex.;"[Kim, Hyoung F.] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Griggs, Whitney S.; Hikosaka, Okihide] NEI, Lab Sensorimotor Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Seoul National University (SNU); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Kim, HF (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;hfkim@snu.ac.kr;;Griggs, Whitney/0000-0003-2941-6803;"Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health; National Eye Institute; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1A2C2005213]";"Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)";We thank M.K.

Reduction of thalamic neurons, a key feature of the neuropathology of schizophrenia, could also have a prenatal origin via disruption of thalamic neurogenesis. This study investigates whether craniofacial dysmorphology and thalamic neuron loss might be associated manifestations of a disruption in embryonic development. Methods: Thalamic neurons were deleted by exposing fetal macaques to x-rays during thalamic genesis (E3342). Another group of macaques was irradiated after thalamic genesis (E70-81). Body, head, and facial measurements were obtained from the early irradiated (EX), late irradiated (LX), and control animals at adulthood. Results: Head width, distance between outer eye edges, and ear width were smaller in EX macaques compared with control animals. The LX macaques exhibited only reduced ear width compared with control animals. Conclusions: These findings indicate that certain features of thalamic neuropathology and craniofacial dysmorphogenesis observed in schizophrenic patients may have a common etiology.

The first network consists of ten feedforward levels where a Poisson spike train with varying firing rate is applied as an input in layer one. Although the balanced state partially avoids spike synchronization during the transmission, the average firing-rate in the last layer either decays or saturates depending on the feedforward pathway gain. The last layer activity is almost independent of the input even for a carefully chosen intermediate gain. Adding connections to the feedforward pathway by a nine areas Pulvinar structure improves the firing-rate propagation to become almost linear among layers. Incoming strong pulvinar spikes balance the low feedforward gain to have a unit input-output relation in the last layer. Pulvinar neurons evoke a bimodal activity depending on the magnitude input: synchronized spike bursts between 20 and 80 Hz and an asynchronous activity for very both low and high frequency inputs. In the first regime, spikes of last feedforward layer neurons are asynchronous with weak, low frequency, oscillations in the rate. Here, the uncorrelated incoming feedforward pathway washes out the synchronized thalamic bursts. In the second regime, spikes in the whole network are asynchronous. As the number of cortical layers increases, long-range pulvinar connections can link directly two or more cortical stages avoiding their either saturation or gradual activity falling. The Pulvinar acts as a shortcut that supplies the input-output firing-rate relationship of two separated cortical areas without changing the strength of connections in the feedforward pathway.;"[Cortes, Nelson] CHNO Quinze Vingts, CNRS U7210, INSERM, UMRS UPMC 968,Inst Vis, F-75012 Paris, France; [van Vreeswijk, Carl] Univ Paris 05, Ctr Neurophys, Physiol & Pathol, Paris, France; [van Vreeswijk, Carl] CNRS UMR 8119, Paris, France";"CHNO des Quinze-Vingts; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite";Cortes, N (corresponding author), CHNO Quinze Vingts, CNRS U7210, INSERM, UMRS UPMC 968,Inst Vis, 17 Rue Moreau, F-75012 Paris, France.;nelsoncortesh@gmail.com;;;"Franco-Chilean Government; CONICYT;  [ANR-09-SYSC-002-02]";"Franco-Chilean Government; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); ";We thank Paul-Henri Prevot, German Mato, and David Golomb for valuable comments and their careful reading of the manuscript.

Transneuronal atrophy occurred in neurons of the dorsal column (DCN) and ventral posterior lateral thalamic (VPL) nuclei in monkeys subjected to cervical and upper thoracic dorsal rhizotomies for 13-21 years and that had shown extensive representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex and thalamus in other experiments. Volumes of DCN and VPL, number and sizes of neurons, and neuronal packing density were measured by unbiased stereological techniques. When compared with the opposite, unaffected, side, the ipsilateral cuneate nucleus (CN), external cuneate nucleus (ECN), and contralateral VPL showed reductions in volume: 44-51% in CN, 37-48% in ECN, and 32-38% in VPL. In the affected nuclei, neurons were progressively shrunken with increasing survival time, and their packing density increased, but there was relatively little loss of neurons (10-16%). There was evidence for loss of axons of atrophic CN cells in the medial lemniscus and in the thalamus, with accompanying severe disorganization of the parts of the ventral posterior nuclei representing the normally innervated face and the deafferented upper limb. Secondary transneuronal atrophy in VPL, associated with retraction of axons of CN neurons undergoing primary transneuronal atrophy, is likely to be associated with similar withdrawal of axons from the cerebral cortex and should be a powerful influence on reorganization of somatotopic maps in the somatosensory cortex.;"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Tulane Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Struct & Cellular Biol, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Psychol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; Tulane University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;"NCI NIH HHS [P01 CA095616] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH53369] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS21377, NS35246, R01 NS021377] Funding Source: Medline";"NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;83;49;49;0;1;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011) showed that distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was coregistered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The 3D dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.;"[Ilinsky, Igor; Gressens, Pierre; Verney, Catherine; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Hop Robert Debre, INSERM, U1141, UMRS 1141, Paris, France; [Ilinsky, Igor; Gressens, Pierre; Verney, Catherine; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Horn, Andreas] Charite, Movement Disorders & Neuromodulat Unit, D-10967 Berlin, Germany; [Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine] CNRS, PICT IBISA Inst Curie, Unite Mixte Rech 144, F-75005 Paris, France; [Ilinsky, Igor; Kultas-Ilinsky, Kristy] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; UNICANCER; Institut Curie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Iowa";"Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Hop Robert Debre, INSERM, U1141, UMRS 1141, Paris, France.;Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.;Ilinsky, I (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.";igorkristy@gmail.com;"Horn, Andreas/R-6528-2017; gressens, pierre/M-7557-2017; Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine/L-8287-2018";"Horn, Andreas/0000-0002-0695-6025; gressens, pierre/0000-0002-0909-4221; Paul-Gilloteaux, Perrine/0000-0002-4822-165X";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Universite Paris Diderot; Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol; PremUp Fondation; Berlin Institute of Health";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)); Universite Paris Diderot; Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol; PremUp Fondation; Berlin Institute of Health";This work was supported by Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Universite Paris Diderot, Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol, and PremUp Fondation, and Berlin Institute of Health.;;55;40;40;0;1;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;;2373-2822;;ENEURO;eNeuro;MAY-JUN;2018;5;3;;;;;;;0060-18.2018;10.1523/ENEURO.0060-18.2018;http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0060-18.2018;;;17;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;GQ9ZP;30023427;Green Published, gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000442165100007;View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to determine whether the DA innervation of the primate MD shares the anatomical features of the mesocortical or nigrostriatal DA projections, we performed tract-tracing and immunocytochemistry studies in macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to identify the location of the DA neurons that project to MD and immuno-electron microscopy to determine the distribution of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in axons within the MD. Similar to the mesocortical projection, retrogradely-labeled, tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons were present in dorsal tier ventral mesencephalic nuclei, such as the ventral tegmental area and the dorsal portion of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, no dual-labeled neurons were present in the ventral tier nuclei, the primary origin of the nigrostriatal DA pathway. In addition, like the DA projection to the prefrontal cortex, DAT immunoreactivity was predominantly localized to the pre-terminal portion of axons in the MD, and was infrequently found in association with synaptic vesicles, in contrast to nigrostriatal DA axons. These findings indicate that the DA projection to the MD shares anatomical features with the mesocortical DA system, suggesting that the functional properties of DA neurotransmission in the MD might be more similar to those in the cortex than in the striatum.

The selection of an appropriate target is first evident even before thalamic axons grow into the cortical plate: initially axons accumulate and wait below their cortical target area in a zone called the subplate. This zone also contains the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex, the subplate neurons. Here we have investigated whether subplate neurons are involved in the process of target selection by thalamic axons by ablating them from specific cortical regions at the onset of the waiting period and examining the subsequent thalamocortical axon projection patterns. Subplate neurons were ablated at the onset of the waiting period by intracortical injections of kainic acid. The effect of the ablation on the thalamocortical projection from visual thalamus was examined by DiI-labeling of the LGN days to weeks following the lesion. At two to four weeks post-lesion, times when LGN axons would have normally invaded the cortical plate, the axons remained below the cortical plate and grew past their appropriate cortical target in an anomalous pathway. Moreover, examination of LGN axons at one week post-lesion, a time when they would normally be waiting and branching within the visual subplate, indicated that the axons had already grown past their correct destination. These observations suggest that visual subplate neurons are involved in the process by which LGN axons select and subsequently grow into visual cortex. In contrast, subplate neurons do not appear to play a major role in the initial morphological development of the LGN itself. Subplate ablations did not alter dendritic growth or shapes of LGN projection neurons during the period under study, nor did it prevent the segregation of retinal ganglion cell axons into eye-specific layers. However, the overall size of the LGN was reduced, suggesting that there may be increased cell death of LGN neurons in the absence of subplate neurons. To examine whether subplate neurons beneath other neocortical areas play a similar role in the formation of thalamocortical connections, subplate neurons were deleted beneath auditory cortex at the onset of the waiting period for auditory thalamic axons. Subsequent DiI labeling revealed that in these animals the majority of MGN axons had grown past auditory cortex instead of innervating it. Taken together these observations underscore a general requirement for subplate neurons throughout neocortex in the process of cortical target selection and ingrowth by thalamic axons. Moreover, they imply that the cortical plate alone has insufficient information to direct the formation of specific sets of thalamocortical connections: interactions involving subplate neurons must also be present.;STANFORD UNIV,MED CTR,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL,STANFORD,CA 94305;Stanford University;;;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY02858] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD07249] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))";;;47;210;214;0;1;COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD;CAMBRIDGE;BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4DL;0950-1991;;;DEVELOPMENT;Development;MAR;1993;117;3;;;;;1031;1047;;;;;;17;Developmental Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Developmental Biology;KY548;8325233;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1993KY54800018;View Full Record in Web of Science

Inhibitory synaptic terminals in the VPL were defined as those that contain flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and that can be shown to be immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There are two types of these profiles: F axon terminals that arise from neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus, and perhaps from VPL local circuit neurons (LCNs); and the dendritic appendages of LCNs that form presynaptic dendrites (PSDs). ML terminals normally have extensive synaptic interactions with PSDs but not with F axon terminals. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that cuneatus lesions resulted in a rapid loss of ML terminals and a statistically significant reduction in both F and PSD synaptic profiles. Confocal scanning microscopy also demonstrated a profound loss of GABA immunoreactivity in the deafferented VPL. These changes persisted for more than 20 weeks, without any evidence of reactive synaptogenesis of surviving sensory afferents or of inhibitory synapses. The changes in GABA circuitry are transneuronal, and the possible mechanisms that may underlie them are discussed. It is suggested that the altered GABAergic circuitry of the VPL in the monkey may serve as a model for understanding changes in somatic sensation in the human following peripheral or central deafferentation.

This system is analysed by resorting to informational neuromorphology which deduces particular properties of information processing from spatial features observed on neuronal arborisations or sets of arborisations. The main part of the cerebro-cerebellar circuit is fine grained with relatively small arborisations. Such a fine grain is not used here for the preservation of a simple somatotopic representation, as is the case for sensory systems, but instead for a processing using << patchy maps >> which is a known mode of parallel processing. There is a major break of arborisations geometry which is situated in the cerebellar cortex between the granule and Purkinje cells. The grain cells axons, the parallel fibers, are numerous and almost unbranched while the dendritic arborisations of Purkinje's cells are flat, with a large surface and are perpendicular to the parallel fibers which leads to both a cardinal and a reception convergence. This is also observed in the striato-pallidal system. A significant difference between the two systems which are separated almost everywhere, notably at the thalamic relays level, is that the system passing through the cerebellum essentially processes sensorimotor information while the basal ganglia system receives information from almost the whole cortex. The return to the cortical targets causes complex interferences. It clearly appears that the two motor systems process information in different manners.;;;PERCHERON, G (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, U106, NEUROMORPHOL INFORMAT & NEUROL EXPTL MOUVEMENT LAB, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE.;;"Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018; Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;104;4;4;0;0;MASSON EDITEUR;MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9;21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE;0035-3787;2213-0004;;REV NEUROL-FRANCE;Rev.

Objective: To assess the beneficial effects of ANT stimulation on hippocampal neurons of epileptic monkeys. Methods: Chronic ANT stimulation was applied to kainic acid-induced epileptic monkeys. Behavioral seizures were continuously monitored. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays were performed to assess the hippocampal injury and the effects of ANT stimulation. Results: The frequency of seizures was 42.8% lower in the stimulation group compared with the sham-stimulation group. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analyses indicated that neuronal loss and apoptosis were less severe and that neurofilament synthesis was enhanced in the stimulation monkeys compared with the sham-stimulation group. These data showed that the hippocampal injury was less severe in monkeys in the stimulation group than in those in the sham-stimulation group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that chronic ANT stimulation may exert protective effects on hippocampal neurons and boost the regeneration of neuronal fibers. These effects may be closely related to the mechanisms of ANT stimulation in epilepsy treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Reorganization of brainstem and thalamic nuclei associated with slow transneuronal atrophy is likely to be a progressive process, When coupled with divergence of ascending connections, it is likely to make a substantial contribution to representational changes in cortex.;"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; Wake Forest University";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH53369] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS21377, NS35246] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;62;188;195;0;8;AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE;WASHINGTON;1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA;0036-8075;;;SCIENCE;Science;NOV 6;1998;282;5391;;;;;1121;1125;;10.1126/science.282.5391.1121;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.282.5391.1121;;;5;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;136YY;9804550;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000076887700050;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although QSM has many applications in detecting iron deposits in the human brain, including the distribution of iron deposits in specific brain regions, the change of iron deposition with aging, and the comparison of iron deposits between diseased groups and healthy controls, few studies have applied QSM to non-human primates, while most animal brain experiments focus on biochemical and anatomical results instead of non-invasive experiments. Additionally, brain imaging in children's research is difficult, but can be substituted using young rhesus monkeys, which are very similar to humans, as research animals. Therefore, understanding the relationship between iron deposition and age in rhesus macaques' brains can offer insights into both the developmental trajectory of magnetic susceptibility in the animal model and the correlated evidence in children's research. Twenty-three healthy rhesus macaque monkeys (23 +/- 7.85 years, range 2-29 years) were included in this research. Seven regions of interest (ROIs-globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, red nucleus) have been analyzed in terms of QSM and R-2* (apparent relaxation rate). Susceptibility in most ROIs correlated significantly with the growth of age, similarly to the results for R-2*, but showed different trends in the thalamus and red nucleus, which may be caused by the different sensitivities of myelination and iron deposition in R-2* and QSM analysis. By assessing the correlation between iron content and age in healthy rhesus macaques' brains using QSM, we provide a piece of pilot information on normality for advanced animal disease models. Meanwhile, this study also could serve as the normative basis for further clinical studies using QSM for iron content quantification. Due to the comparison of the susceptibility on the same experimental objects, this research can also provide practical support for future research on characteristics for QSM and R-2*.;"[Wu, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Anim Models & Human Dis Mech, Kunming Inst Zool, Chinese Acad Sci & Yunnan Prov, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Siyue; Pan, Boyang; Chen, Honghua] RadioDynam Healthcare, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Resource Ctr Nonhuman Primates, Kunming Primate Res Ctr, Kunming Inst Zool, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Natl Res Facil Phenotyp & Genet Anal Model Anim P, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xintian] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Gong, Nan-Jie] Tsinghua Univ, Vector Lab Intelligent Med Imaging & Neural Engn, Int Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Zoology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tsinghua University";"Hu, XT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.;Gong, NJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Vector Lab Intelligent Med Imaging & Neural Engn, Int Innovat Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China.";"xthu@mail.kiz.ac.cn; nanjie.gong@gmail.com";Gong, Nan-Jie/H-8002-2012;"Gong, Nan-Jie/0000-0001-9249-413X; PENG, Siyue/0000-0002-9923-2930";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [XDB32060200]; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2019B030335001]; CAS Light of West China program; Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province [202001AT070130]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31960178, 31800901, 81771387, 81941014]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0801403]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [2020PJD038]";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; CAS Light of West China program; Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program)";"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Grant/Award Number: XDB32060200; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019B030335001; CAS Light of West China program, and the Applied Basic Research Programs of the Science and Technology Commission Foundation of Yunnan Province, Grant/Award Number: 202001AT070130; the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31960178, 31800901, 81771387, 81941014; National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2018YFA0801403; Shanghai Pujiang Program, Grant/Award Number: 2020PJD038";;47;1;1;1;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0952-3480;1099-1492;;NMR BIOMED;NMR Biomed.;SEP;2022;35;9;;;;;;;e4750;10.1002/nbm.4750;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4750;;MAY 2022;10;"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy";3R0LW;35474524;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000795066000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Throughout this so-called slow oscillation, cortical and thalamic neurons fluctuate between periods of intense synaptic activity (Up states) and almost complete silence (Down states). The two decades since the original characterization of the slow oscillation in the cortex and thalamus have seen considerable advances in deciphering the cellular and network mechanisms associated with this pervasive phenomenon. There are, nevertheless, many questions regarding the slow oscillation that await more thorough illumination, particularly the mechanisms by which Up states initiate and terminate, the functional role of the rhythmic activity cycles in unconscious or minimally conscious states, and the precise relation between Up states and the activated states associated with waking behavior. Given the substantial advances in multineuronal recording and imaging methods in both in vivo and in vitro preparations, the time is ripe to take stock of our current understanding of the slow oscillation and pave the way for future investigations of its mechanisms and functions. My aim in this Review is to provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms and functions of the slow oscillation, and to suggest avenues for further exploration.;"[Neske, Garrett T.] Brown Univ, Div Biol & Med, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Neske, Garrett T.] Yale Univ, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"Brown University; Yale University";Neske, GT (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Div Biol & Med, Dept Neurosci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;garrett_neske@brown.edu;;;"NIH [NS-050434]; Robin Chemers Neustein Graduate Fellowship in Brain Science - Brown Institute for Brain Science";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Robin Chemers Neustein Graduate Fellowship in Brain Science - Brown Institute for Brain Science";I thank Barry W.

Despite well described connections on a microscopic scale, derived from tracing studies in animals, little is known about the intrinsic anatomical connections of these nuclei in humans. This lack of knowledge limits not only interpretation of functional imaging studies but also estimation of direct effects of deep brain stimulation which treats diseases as different as epilepsy or major depression. Therefore, non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies are key to analyzing connectivity patterns and elaborate approaches to close this gap. For our study, we explored the structural connectivity of the MD thalamic nuclei and the CM/Pf complex towards five cortical and six subcortical regions by using a preferential fiber calculation. We found both thalamic nuclei to be preferentially associated to distinct networks: whereas the MD is preferentially connected to prefrontal and limbic cortical regions, the CM is linked to subcortical regions. The anterior insula was the only cortical region associated with the subcortical network of the CM and the cortical network of the MD comprised one subcortical hub, the caudate nucleus, suggesting an integrative role of these two regions. Adding to predescribed anatomical tract tracing connectivities in animal studies, our finding lends support to the existence of similar basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in humans and we could show a robust distinction of preferential connectivity for both thalamic nuclei.

The preferred stimulus orientation of these columns span the full range of orientations, as observed in recordings of spikes and in classical optical imaging of intrinsic signals. However, when we imaged the putative thalamic input to striate cortical cells that can be seen in imaging of intrinsic signals when they are analyzed on a larger spatial scale, we found that the orientation domain map of the primary visual cortex did not show the same diversity of orientations. This map was dominated by just the one orientation that is most commonly preferred by neurons in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus. This supports cortical feature selectivity and columnar architecture being built upon feed-forward signals transmitted from the thalamus in a very limited number of broadly tuned input channels.;"[Mohan, Yamni S.; Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Lloyd, Errol K.

In the present study we have combined electron microscopy with immunocytochemistry for the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) to assess the cholinergic synaptic organization of the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus in macaque monkeys. The cholinergic innervation of the MD nucleus showed striking regional variations with the greatest density of immunoreactive axons and varicosities found within the parvicellular division. Electron microscopic examination revealed that these ChAT immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) axons were primarily small and unmyelinated. The majority of immunoreactive synaptic profiles were found within the extraglomerular neuropil (80.5%), with the remainder present in glomerular regions. Within the glomerular and extra-glomerular neuropil ChAT-IR profiles made contact with both conventional, presumably relay cell dendrites (CD), as well as with synaptic vesicle containing dendrites (SVCD) of local circuit neurons. In the glomeruli the frequency of synapses was approximately equal for CDs and SVCDs while in the extraglomerular areas 75% of the synaptic contacts were with CDs. ChAT-IR synaptic profiles had a diversity of junctional complex morphologies. Within glomeruli they made symmetric synapses with CDs and predominantly asymmetric with SVCDs. The majority of extraglomerular contacts (60%) were classified as asymmetric and these as well as the smaller number of symmetric synapses contacted both CDs and SVCDs. In accord with results of physiological studies, these anatomical data indicate that cholinergic input to thalamic nuclei influences relay cell activity both directly and indirectly via local circuit neurons.;;;SCHWARTZ, ML (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,NEUROBIOL SECT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.;;;;"FIC NIH HHS [1-F05-TWO4606-01] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH44866-04] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS22807-06] Funding Source: Medline";"FIC NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;54;21;21;1;1;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

A 'hypersynchronous seizure onset pattern' in ictal EEG was only seen in 6 (26%) patients (1 patient with bilateral, 5 with unilateral TLE).

In the present study and its companion (Smiley et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [this issue]), neuroanatomical tracers were injected into CM and adjacent areas of the superior temporal plane to identify sources of auditory and somatosensory input to this region. Other than CM, target areas included: A1, caudolateral belt (CL), retroinsular (Ri), and temporal parietotemporal (Tpt). Cells labeled by injections of these areas were distributed mainly among the ventral (MGV), posterodorsal (MGpd), anterodorsal (MGad), and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC) and several nuclei with established multisensory features: posterior (Po), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM). The principal inputs of CM were MGad, MGv, and MGm, with secondary inputs from multisensory nuclei. The main inputs of CL were Po and MGpd, with secondary inputs from MGad, MGm, and multisensory nuclei. A1 was dominated by inputs from MGv and MGad, with light multisensory inputs. The input profile of Tpt closely resembled that of CL, but with reduced MGC inputs.

The results indicate that the thalamic inputs of areas in the caudal superior temporal plane arise mainly from the same nuclei, but in different proportions.

For a better understanding of the development of the thalamus, the time sequence of the location of neurons in thalamic nuclei was examined in a developing marsupial embryo and fetus. To accomplish this, uptake of tritiated thymidine was examined in the gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) from 3 days before birth through 16 days after birth. Total neurogenesis was optimal 4 days after birth. Plots of the labeled cells revealed that thalamic and cortical development are almost concurrent, similar to the time course of eutherian mammals. A consistent time gradient of proliferation in dorsal thalamus was not found. Rather, sectors of the dorsal thalamus showed significant differences regardless of day of development. The dorsal sector showed more neurogenesis than the ventral sector, caudal more than rostral, and lateral more than the medial sector.

To determine which GABAA receptor subunit proteins are found in the human thalamus we investigated the distribution of five major GABAA receptor subunits alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(2,3) and gamma(2) using immunohistochemical techniques. The alpha(1), beta(2,3)- and gamma(2)- subunits which combine to form a benzodiazepine sensitive GABAA receptor showed the most intense levels of staining and were the most common subunits found throughout the human thalamus especially in the ventral and posterior nuclear groups. The next most intense staining was for the alpha(3)-subunit followed by the alpha(2)-subunit. The intralaminar nuclear group, the mediodorsal nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus contained alpha(1)-, beta(2,3)-and gamma(2)-subunits staining as well as the highest levels of the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)- subunits. The sensory dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus contained very high levels of alpha(1)- and beta(2,3)- and gamma(2) -subunits. The highest densities of GABAA receptors found throughout the thalamus which contained the subunits alpha(1), beta(2,3), and gamma(2) included nuclei which are especially involved in the control or the modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuits and are thus important in disorders such as Huntington's disease where the GABAergic projections of the basal ganglia are compromised. In addition the majority of receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus contain alpha(3) and gamma(2) subunits whilst the intralaminar nuclei contain high levels of alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits.

However, mapping the neuronal projections with individual-axon resolution in the large and complex primate brain is still challenging. Herein, we describe a highly efficient pipeline for three-dimensional mapping of the entire macaque brain with subcellular resolution. The pipeline includes a novel poly-N-acryloyl glycinamide (PNAGA)based embedding method for long-term structure and fluorescence preservation, high-resolution and rapid whole-brain optical imaging, and image post-processing. The cytoarchitectonic information of the entire macaque brain was acquired with a voxel size of 0.32 gm x 0.32 gm x 10 gm, showing its anatomical structure with cell distribution, density, and shape. Furthermore, thanks to viral labeling, individual long-distance projection axons from the frontal cortex were for the first time reconstructed across the entire brain hemisphere with a voxel size of 0.65 gm x 0.65 gm x 3 gm. Our results show that individual cortical axons originating from the prefrontal cortex simultaneously target multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain. This pipeline provides an efficient method for cellular and circuitry investigation of the whole macaque brain with individual-axon resolution, and can shed light on brain function and disorders.

Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors.;"Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832";;;;;99;262;265;0;11;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Hence, we expected that the consciousness neuronal correlate covers these properties in structural level. These properties could be captured in small-worldness properties, i.e. high clustering coefficient and low path-length. Thalamocortical (TC) loop and cortex are two main candidates for Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC). We studied small-worldness in these systems. For this purpose, we calculated clustering coefficients, characteristic path lengths and their robustness against lesions. We simulated lesions in two ways: eliminating connections, and deleting nodes. We used anatomical connections of TC and cortex of macaque from the CoCoMac neuroinformatic database. Our results show that: 1) Lesions causes an increase in path length and decrease in clustering coefficient which cause the destruction of the integration and segregation capabilities of brain network; 2) Deleting the connections is more destructive than deleting the nodes; 3) During high levels of lesions, the thalamo-cortical connections are more important than cortico-cortical connections in the sense of clustering coefficient. In terms of path-length, during high levels of nodes' lesions, the thalamo-cortical connections are more important than cortico-cortical connections, while during edges' lesions cortico-cortical connections are more important than thalamo-cortical connections (C) 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

Two of the sites, the lateral and orbital regions, had previously been shown to provide functionally dissociable contributions to distinct forms of behavioral flexibility, attentional set-shifting and discrimination reversal learning, respectively. The dysgranular and agranular regions lying on the orbital and medial surfaces of the frontal lobes were most closely connected with limbic structures including cingulate cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medial caudate nucleus, and nucleus accumbens as well as the magnocellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and midline thalamic nuclei, consistent with findings in the rhesus monkey. In contrast, the granular region on the dorsal surface closely resembled area 8Ad in macaques and had connections restricted to posterior parietal cortex primarily associated with visuospatial functions. However, it also had connections with limbic cortex, including retrosplenial and caudal cingulate cortex as well as auditory processing regions in the superior temporal cortex. The granular region on the lateral convexity had the most extensive connections. Based on its architectonics and functionality, it resembled areas 12/45 in macaques. It had connections with high-order visual processing regions in the inferotemporal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, higher-order auditory and polymodal processing regions in the superior temporal cortex.

In unoperated animals, the region of VPL representing the hand was characterized by relatively dense and homogeneous CO staining throughout the rostral-caudal extent of VPL. Counts of neurons in the VPL hand representation from adjacent thalamic sections processed for Nissl and GABA immunostaining indicated that there were approximately 261.4 neurons/mm(2) of which 78.4/mm(2) stained positive for GABA. GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were readily apparent throughout the VPL. By contrast, animals that received total removals of the postcentral hand representations showed a dramatic reduction in CO staining in the VPL, which was confined to the expected location of the thalamic hand representation. Counts of neurons in the affected region from adjacent sections that underwent Nissl staining and GABA immunostaining also revealed a dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons, with a smaller reduction in the number of neurons staining positive for GABA. Specifically, large to medium-sized (> 180 mu m(2)) GABA(-) neurons were virtually eliminated in the affected portion of the VPL, and the numbers of GABA(+) neurons were significantly reduced. The remaining population of GABA(+) neurons was typically shrunken, and no GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were observed in the affected region. The results obtained after subtotal ablation of the postcentral hand representations (only one postcentral area spared, 3b or 3a) differed from those obtained when total removals were made. Instead of virtually complete degeneration of medium-sized to large neurons throughout the hand representation in VPL, as was the case with total removals, after partial removals, we found alternating regions in the VPL hand representation that appeared qualitatively normal, or dramatically degenerated. Thalamic sections stained with CO revealed light, moderate, and darkly stained patches of label within the hand representation in VP, depending on the type of cortical ablation. The most dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons coincided precisely with the lightest staining CO patches. Interestingly, the only statistically significant reduction in the number of GABA(+) neurons occurred in the light CO patches. In the thalamic regions coincident with the dark and moderately stained CO patches, the number of medium-sized and large neurons decreased, but the number of GABA(+) neurons was comparable to normal. Optical density measurements of the dark patches also indicated a statistically significant difference from normal CO staining in this region. These findings indicate that following cortical damage, complex changes occur in thalamic circuitry. Interestingly, these changes are not confined to regions of the thalamus that have their major projection to the damaged region of cortex, but include thalamic regions in which the major projection is to undamaged regions of cortex. Thus, relatively restricted cortical damage has the potential to affect regions of cortex not directly damaged, through post-injury changes in thalamic circuitry. Such changes in neuronal circuitry, especially at the thalamocortical level, may serve as the neural substrate for the limited recovery of behavioral function often seen after strokes or head injury.

Before tracer injection, single-unit recordings were made to select injection sites in the forelimb regions where neurons with set- and/or movement-related activity before forelimb movements were densely located. Following the PMd injections, labeled cells were found mainly in rostral portion of VLc and VLo. Gels projecting to PMv were found mainly in X and VPLo. Projection cells to the MI were found in VPLo, VLc, and VLo. Locations of neurons projecting to different motor areas were not overlapped in the thalamic nuclei.

However, despite extensive research, uncertainty about the ideal target remains with many structures being underexplored. The aim of this report is to address a new target for DBS, the medial dorsal (MD) and the ventral anterior (VA) nucleus of the thalamus, which has thus far received little attention in the treatment of OCD. Methods In this retrospective trial, four patients (three female, one male) aged 31-48 years, suffering from therapy-refractory OCD underwent high-frequency DBS of the MD and VA. In two patients (de novo group) the thalamus was chosen as a primary target for DBS, whereas in two patients (rescue DBS group) lead implantation was performed in a rescue DBS attempt following unsuccessful primary stimulation. Results Continuous thalamic stimulation yielded no significant improvement in OCD symptom severity. Over the course of thalamic DBS symptoms improved in only one patient who showed partial response on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (Y-BOCS) Scale. Beck Depression Inventory scores dropped by around 46% in the de novo group; anxiety symptoms improved by up to 34%. In the de novo DBS group no effect of DBS on anxiety and mood was observable. Conclusion MD/VA-DBS yielded no adequate alleviation of therapy-refractory OCD, the overall strategy in targeting MD/VA as described in this paper can thus not be recommended in DBS for OCD. The magnocellular portion of MD (MDMC), however, might prove a promising target in the treatment of mood related and anxiety disorders.";"[Maarouf, Mohammad; Neudorfer, Clemens; El Majdoub, Faycal; Lenartz, Doris] Univ Witten Herdecke, Cologne Merheim Med Ctr, Dept Stereotaxy & Funct Neurosurg, Cologne, Germany; [Kuhn, Jens] Johanniter Hosp Oberhausen, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat Med, Oberhausen, Germany; [Sturm, Volker] Univ Hosp Wurzburg, Dept Neurosurg, Wurzburg, Germany";"Witten Herdecke University; University of Wurzburg";Maarouf, M (corresponding author), Univ Witten Herdecke, Cologne Merheim Med Ctr, Dept Stereotaxy & Funct Neurosurg, Cologne, Germany.;maaroufm@kliniken-koeln.de;;Neudorfer, Clemens/0000-0002-3153-1045;;;;;100;19;19;0;7;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;;;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;AUG 9;2016;11;8;;;;;;;e0160750;10.1371/journal.pone.0160750;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160750;;;21;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;DT3IK;27504631;gold, Green Published, Green Submitted;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000381374200059;View Full Record in Web of Science

Knowledge of these connections in the human is a prerequisite for stereotactic neurosurgical approaches designed to alleviate movement disorders by the placement of lesions in specific nuclei. Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus.;"UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA; CATHOLIC UNIV ROME, NEUROL INST, ROME, ITALY";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli";;;;;NIMH NIH HHS [MH/DA 52154] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;93;101;103;0;8;AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS;ROLLING MEADOWS;5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA;0022-3085;1933-0693;;J NEUROSURG;J.

Counts were made in 10-mu-m-thick frozen sections and in 1-mu-m-thick plastic sections and stereological formulae applied to obtain an accurate assessment of the volumetric density of GABA cells in the nuclei. It was found that GABA-immunoreactive cells account for at least 27% of the cells per unit area of all the thalamic nuclei investigated and up to as much as 50% by unit volume. The intralaminar nuclei show only slightly fewer GABA cells than the principal relay nuclei. Previous reports of their absence or relatively low numbers in the intralaminar nuclei probably stem from their smaller size, relatively weaker immunoreactive staining and from failure to apply sterometric formulae that reveal the density of neurons per volume of tissue.

Despite early evidence and theoretical proposal pointing to an implication of thalamic control in attention, most studies in the past two decades focused on cortical substrates, largely ignoring the contribution of subcortical regions as well as cortico-subcortical interactions. Here, we suggest a key role of the pulvinar in the selection of salient and relevant information via its involvement in priority maps. Prioritization may be achieved through a pulvinar-mediated generation of alpha oscillations, which may then modulate neuronal gain in thalamo-cortical circuits. Such mechanism might orchestrate the synchrony of cortico-cortical interaction, by rendering neural communication more effective, precise and selective. We propose that this theoretical framework will support a timely shift from the prevailing cortico-centric view of cognition to a more integrative perspective of thalamic contributions to attention and executive control processes.;"[Bourgeois, Alexia; Carrera, Emmanuel] Univ Hosp Geneva HUG, Univ Med Sch Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Dept, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Guedj, Carole; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med Sch Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Fundamental Neurosci, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland";"University of Geneva; University of Geneva";"Bourgeois, A (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Geneva HUG, Univ Med Sch Geneva, Dept Clin Neurosci, Neurol Dept, Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.;Guedj, C (corresponding author), Univ Med Sch Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Fundamental Neurosci, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.";"alexia.bourgeois@unige.ch; carole.guedj@unige.ch";Vuilleumier, Patrik/AAJ-1839-2021;"Vuilleumier, Patrik/0000-0002-8198-9214; Guedj, Carole/0000-0001-9477-8873; Carrera, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0045-5382; Bourgeois, Alexia/0000-0002-7397-6835";"Swiss National Science Foundation [320030_166704, 320030_166535]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [320030_166704, 320030_166535] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)";"Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";This work was supported by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to PV [grant number 320030_166704] and EC [grant number 320030_166535].;;144;14;14;5;15;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0149-7634;1873-7528;;NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R;Neurosci.

Neurons in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the somatosensory thalamus and in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) respond to vibrotactile stimulation with relatively slow modulations (similar to 100 ms) of their firing rate. In addition, faster modulations (similar to 10 ms) time-locked to the stimulus waveform are observed in both areas, but their contribution to stimulus detection is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether VPL and S1 neurons encode stimulus presence with similar accuracy and via the same response features. To address these questions, we recorded single neurons while trained monkeys judged the presence or absence of a vibrotactile stimulus of variable amplitude, and their activity was analyzed with a unique decoding method that is sensitive to the time scale of the firing rate fluctuations. We found that the maximum detection accuracy of single neurons is similar in VPL and S1. However, VPL relies more heavily on fast rate modulations than S1, and as a consequence, the neural code in S1 is more tolerant: its performance degrades less when the readout method or the time scale of integration is suboptimal. Therefore, S1 neurons implement a more robust code, one less sensitive to the temporal integration window used to infer stimulus presence downstream. The differences between VPL and S1 responses signaling the appearance of a stimulus suggest a transformation of the neural code from thalamus to cortex.;"[Vazquez, Yuriria; Romo, Ranulfo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular Neurociencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Salinas, Emilio] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Romo, Ranulfo] El Colegio Nacl, Mexico City 06020, DF, Mexico";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Wake Forest University";Salinas, E (corresponding author), Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.;"esalinas@wakehealth.edu; rromo@ifc.unam.mx";;"Salinas, Emilio/0000-0001-7411-5693; Vazquez, Yuriria/0000-0003-4198-1135; romo, ranulfo/0000-0003-3529-3635";"Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Direccion General del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia";"Howard Hughes Medical Institute(Howard Hughes Medical Institute); Direccion General del Personal Academico de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))";We thank A.

Knowledge of these connections in the human is a prerequisite for stereotactic neurosurgical approaches designed to alleviate movement disorders by the placement of lesions in specific nuclei. Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus.;"UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA; CATHOLIC UNIV ROME, NEUROL INST, ROME, ITALY";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli";;;;;NIMH NIH HHS [MHDA 52154] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;93;29;29;0;5;AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS;ROLLING MEADOWS;5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA;0022-3085;1933-0693;;J NEUROSURG;J.

Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance scanning, however, showed involvement of the rostral mesencephalon as well.

The rabbit limbic thalamus may play an important role in these functions, but has not been studied extensively in terms of its cytoarchitecture, the topographical organization of its cortical projections, and differential transmitter regulation of its subnuclei. Therefore, the architecture, projections to cingulate cortex, and radioligand binding were investigated in the anterior, ventral, lateral, and midline nuclei of rabbit thalamus. The anterior nuclei are highly differentiated because both the dorsal and ventral nuclei have parvicellular and magnocellular divisions. Fluorescent dyes were injected into cingulate cortex to evaluate limbic thalamocortical connections. The anterior medial, submedial, and parafascicular nuclei project primarily to anterior cingulate cortex, while they have small or no projections to posterior areas. The ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei have a significant projection to dorsal cingulate cortex, including areas 24b and 29d. Projections of the anterior ventral nucleus are topographically organized, since medial parts of the parvicellular division project to rostral area 29, and lateral parts project to caudal area 29. The lateral nuclei and the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus project with progressively higher densities in the rostrocaudal plane of area 29. Finally, the magnocellular division of the anterior ventral nucleus projects almost exclusively to caudal and ventral area 29, i.e., granular retrosplenial cortex. Ligand binding studies employed coverslip autoradiography and single grain counting techniques. Muscarinic receptor binding was moderate for both pirenzepine and oxotremorine-M in the parvicellular anterior ventral nucleus, while in other nuclei, there was an inverse relationship in the binding for these ligands. Most notably, the anterior dorsal nucleus, which receives no cholinergic input, had very high oxotremorine-M and low pirenzepine binding, while the anterior medial nucleus, which receives a moderate cholinergic input, had the highest pirenzepine binding and very low oxotremorine-M binding. Muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors was highest in the anterior ventral nucleus, while it was at moderate levels in the anterior dorsal and lateral nuclei. The binding of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol to mu opioid receptors and 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin to delta opioid receptors were both high in the parvicellular and low in the magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus. The magnocellular division of the anterior ventral, the lateral dorsal, and the parafascicular nuclei had high mu opioid binding, while the lateral dorsal and lateral magnocellular nuclei had low levels of delta opioid binding. The submedial nucleus had moderate binding of both opioid compounds. These results suggest that the limbic thalamus in the rabbit is highly differentiated and has topographically organized connections to cingulate cortex. Some of these connections may mediate responses to noxious stimuli including those from the submedial and parafascicular nuclei. Finally, the ligand binding studies indicate that transmitter systems differentially regulate the various subnuclei within the limbic thalamus and may modulate different components of limbic thalamocortical circuitry.;NORTHEASTERN UNIV,DEPT PHYS THERAPY,BOSTON,MA 02118;Northeastern University;VOGT, LJ (corresponding author), WAKE FOREST UNIV,BOWMAN GRAY SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,300 S HAWTHORNE RD,WINSTON SALEM,NC 27103, USA.;;"anand, amit/A-7222-2009; Vogt, Brent A/C-4038-2015";Vogt, Brent A/0000-0003-1228-4410;"NIDA NIH HHS [P50 DA06634] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS18745] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;75;37;37;0;0;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

However, it is not clear whether the neural connections of the posteroventral part differ from those of the rest of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Here, we describe the thalamic connections of the posteroventral part of monkey area 23b (pv-area 23b), the main component of the posteroventral posterior cingulate gyrus. We compare these thalamic connections with those of the more dorsal area 23b (d-area 23b) and of adjoining retrosplenial areas 29 and 30. Thalamocortical projections to pv-area 23b originate mainly from the anterior nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. In contrast, projections to d-area 23b originate from the nucleus lateralis posterior, medial pulvinar, nucleus centralis latocellularis, mediodorsal nucleus and nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis and weakly from the anterior nuclei. Projections to retrosplenial areas 29 and 30 originate from the anterior nuclei. Corticothalamic projections from pv-area 23b terminate in the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. Projections from d-area 23b terminate in these nuclei as well as the nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis. Projections from area 30 terminate mainly in the anterior nuclei and, to a lesser extent, in the medial pulvinar. These results show that the connections of pv-area 23b differ from those of d-area 23b or areas 29 and 30. This suggests that pv-area 23b may play distinct functional roles in memory processes, such as spatial and auditory memory.;"Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Vet Anat, Fac Agr, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Behav Physiol, Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo 1838526, Japan";"Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science";Shibata, H (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Dept Vet Anat, Fac Agr, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.;shibata@cc.tuat.ac.jp;Shibata, Hideshi/H-6588-2013;Shibata, Hideshi/0000-0002-6030-1994;;;;;33;26;27;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study, wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain, especially the temporal lobe and thalamus, were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp, ictal and cortical electroencephalography, MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients, Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition, hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however, corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor.

The lateral route, named lateral grasping network, is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named reach-to-grasp network, is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments.;"[Gamberini, Michela; Passarelli, Lauretta; Filippini, Matteo; Fattori, Patrizia; Galletti, Claudio] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy";University of Bologna;Gamberini, M (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.;m.gamberini@unibo.it;"Gamberini, Michela/AAO-5724-2020; Fattori, Patrizia/Q-8947-2017";"Gamberini, Michela/0000-0003-0945-9734; Fattori, Patrizia/0000-0002-0079-3755; GALLETTI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8927-3408";"Alma Mater Studiorum -Universita di Bologna within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2017KZNZLN]; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna (Bando Internazionalizzazione), Italy; European Commission [H2020-EIC-FETPROACT-2019-951910-MAIA]";"Alma Mater Studiorum -Universita di Bologna within the CRUI-CARE Agreement; Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna (Bando Internazionalizzazione), Italy; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)";Open access funding provided by Alma Mater Studiorum -Universita di Bologna within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

However, it is unknown whether these increases occur in the thalamic division of the auditory system, the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Furthermore, it is also unclear whether these age-related changes are specific to the macaque auditory system or are generalized to other sensory systems. To address these questions, the PV immunoreactivity of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) from seven rhesus macaques ranging in age from 15 to 35 was assessed. Densities of PV expressing neurons in the three subdivisions of the MGN and the six layers of the LGN were calculated separately using unbiased stereological sampling techniques. We found that the ventral and magnocellular subdivisions of the MGN and all six layers of the LGN increased their expressions of PV with age, although increases in the MGN were greater in magnitude than in the LGN. Together, these results suggest that the MGN shows age-related increases in PV expression as is seen throughout the macaque ascending auditory system, and that the analogous region of the visual system shows smaller increases. We conclude that, while there are some similarities between sensory systems, the age-related neurochemical changes seen throughout the macaque auditory system cannot be fully generalized to other sensory systems.;"[Gray, Daniel T.; Rudolph, Megan L.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Davis";Recanzone, GH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ghrecanzone@ucdavis.edu;;;"NIA [R21AG024372, R01AG034137]; NIDCD [T32DC008072]";"NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))";The authors would like to thank Xochi Navarro and Dina Juarez Salinas for their help with this project, and Rhonda Oates-O'Brien and Guy Martin for excellent animal care.

The injections were placed in the forelimb and eye-movement representations of PMD and in the forelimb representation of PMV as determined by microstimulation mapping. For comparison, injections were also placed in the forelimb representation of primary motor cortex (MI) of two owl monkeys. The results indicate that both PMD and PMV receive dense projections from the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus, and sparser projections from the ventromedial (VM), mediodorsal (MD) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. Labeled neurons in VL were concentrated in the anterior (VLa) and the medial (VLx) nuclei, with only a few labeled cells in the dorsal (VLd) and posterior (VLp) nuclei. In VA, labeled neurons were concentrated in the parvocellular division (VApc) dorsomedial to VLa. Labeled neurons in MD were concentrated in the most lateral and posterior parts of the nucleus. VApc projected more densely to PMD than PMV, especially to rostral PMD, whereas caudal PMD received stronger projections from neurons in VLx and VLa. VLd projected exclusively to PMD, and not to PMV. In addition, neurons labeled by PMD injections tended to be more dorsal in VL, IL, and MD than those labeled by PMV injections. The results indicate that both premotor areas receive indirect inputs from the cerebellum (via VLx, VLd and IL) and globus pallidus (via VLa, VApc, and MD). Comparisons of thalamic projections to premotor and M1 indicate that both regions receive strong projections from VLx and VLa, with the populations of cells projecting to M1 located more laterally in these nuclei. VApc, VLd, and MD project mainly to premotor areas, while VLp projects mainly to M1. Overall, the thalamic connectivity patterns of premotor cortex in New World owl monkeys are similar to those reported for Old World monkeys. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus as a remote effect of surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred two postoperative MR imaging examinations in 125 patients after cerebral surgery were retrospectively reviewed, focusing on the presence of reduced diffusion in the striatum and/or thalamus. The distribution of reduced diffusion in the striatum was classified into 3 groups: anterior, central, and posterior. Reduced diffusion in the thalamus was also classified on the basis of the anatomic locations of the thalamic nuclei. Further follow-up MRI was available in all patients with postoperative reduced diffusion, and acute infarctions were excluded. The patient medical records were reviewed to evaluate neurologic status. RESULTS: Restriction of diffusion was observed in the striatum and/or thalamus ipsilateral to the surgical site in 17 patients (13.6%). The distribution of signal abnormality correlated with the location of the operation, in concordance with the architecture of the striatocortical and thalamocortical connections. Reduced diffusion was observed from days 7 to 46 after the operation, especially during days 8-21. The signal abnormalities completely resolved on follow-up examinations. The median follow-up period was 202 days (interquartile range, 76-487 days). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and/or thalamus likely represents an early phase of secondary neuronal degeneration based on its characteristic distribution and time course. Clinically, this reduced diffusion should not be mistaken for postoperative ischemic injury.;"[Kamiya, K.; Sato, N.; Nakata, Y.; Ito, K.; Kimura, Y.] Natl Ctr Hosp Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Radiol, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878551, Japan; [Takahashi, A.] Natl Ctr Hosp Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Neurosurg, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878551, Japan; [Ota, M.] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Res Natl Inst Neurosci, Dept Mental Disorders, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan; [Mori, H.; Kunimatsu, A.; Ohtomo, K.] Tokyo Univ Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Radiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 113, Japan";"National Center for Neurology & Psychiatry - Japan; National Center for Neurology & Psychiatry - Japan; National Center for Neurology & Psychiatry - Japan; University of Tokyo";Sato, N (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Hosp Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Radiol, 4-1-1 Ogawahigashi Chyo, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878551, Japan.;snoriko@ncnp.go.jp;"MORI, Harushi/AAA-2669-2022; Kunimatsu, Akira/AAC-8617-2019";"MORI, Harushi/0000-0003-1370-5272; Kunimatsu, Akira/0000-0002-7141-2585";"Bayer Healthcare; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21591589] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Bayer Healthcare(Bayer AGBayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";Akira Kunimatsu-UNRELATED: Grant: research grant from Bayer Healthcare.* *Money paid to the institution.;;43;8;8;0;1;AMER SOC NEURORADIOLOGY;DENVILLE;PO BOX 3000, DENVILLE, NJ 07834-9349 USA;0195-6108;1936-959X;;AM J NEURORADIOL;Am.

The cellular features which contribute to the functional specialization of its subsectors are poorly understood. In this study we determined the distribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in structurally and functionally distinct prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey. This class of neurons express nitric oxide synthase which is necessary for the production of nitric oxide, a novel neural messenger implicated in learning and memory. The density of diaphorase-positive neurons was approximately four times higher in olfactory areas than in eulaminate areas (areas 9, 10, 12, 46, and 8), and two- to three-times higher in the agranular limbic area PAll than in eulaminate areas. Positive neurons were concentrated in a deep band (layers V and VI), a superficial band (layers II and upper III), and were sparsely distributed in the central, thalamic recipient zone (deep layer III, layer IV and upper V). The highest densities of positive neurons were observed in the white matter where their prevalence Followed the opposite trend than in the corresponding overlying cortices. The distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons was correlated with the regional anatomic and functional specialization of prefrontal cortices. Thus, diaphorase-positive neurons were most densely distributed in orbital and then medial prefrontal limbic cortices which have a low cell density and widespread connections. In contrast, positive neurons were comparatively sparse in eulaminate cortices, which have a high cell density and more restricted connections. These findings indicate that the distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons in prefrontal cortices is not random, but is associated with the structural architecture and Functional attributes of these cortices. The preponderance of diaphorase-positive neurons in limbic cortices, which have been implicated in learning and memory, is consistent with the idea that nitric oxide may have a role in synaptic plasticity.;"BOSTON UNIV, DEPT HLTH SCI, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT BEHAV NEUROSCI, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; HARVARD UNIV, SCH MED, NEW ENGLAND REG PRIMATE RES CTR, BOSTON, MA USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";;;;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;NINDS NIH HHS [NS24760] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;127;24;24;0;0;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;MAY;1996;72;1;;;;;49;62;;10.1016/0306-4522(95)00539-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00539-0;;;14;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;UC923;8730705;Green Submitted, hybrid;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1996UC92300005;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, stimuli inducing arousal also trigger a widespread electroencephalographic (EEG) response reflecting the coordinated activation of a large cortical network. Because functional connectivity between distant cortical areas is thought to be underpinned by trans-thalamic connections involving associative thalamic nuclei, we investigated the possible involvement of one principal associative thalamic nucleus, the medial pulvinar (PuM), in the sleeper's responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli. Intra-cortical and intra-thalamic signals were analysed in 440 intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) segments during nocturnal sleep in eight epileptic patients receiving laser nociceptive stimuli. The spectral coherence between the PuM and 10 cortical regions grouped in networks was computed during 5 s before and 1 s after the nociceptive stimulus and contrasted according to the presence or absence of an arousal EEG response. Pre- and post-stimulus phase coherence between the PuM and all cortical networks was significantly increased in instances of arousal, both during N2 and paradoxical (rapid eye movement [REM]) sleep. Thalamo-cortical enhancement in coherence involved both sensory and higher level cortical networks and predominated in the pre-stimulus period. The association between pre-stimulus widespread increase in thalamo-cortical coherence and subsequent arousal suggests that the probability of sleep interruption by a noxious stimulus increases when it occurs during phases of enhanced trans-thalamic transfer of information between cortical areas.;"[Bastuji, Helene; Cadic-Melchior, Andeol; Ruelle-Le Glaunec, Lucien; Magnin, Michel; Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Univ Claude Bernard, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Cent Integrat Pain NeuroPain Lab, INSERM U1028,CNRS,UMR5292, Bron, France; [Bastuji, Helene] Hosp Civils Lyon, Ctr Sommeil, Bron, France; [Garcia-Larrea, Luis] Hop Neurol, Ctr Evaluat & Traitement Douleur, Lyon, France; [Bastuji, Helene] Univ Claude Bernard, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Cent Integrat Pain NeuroPain Lab, INSERM U1028,CNRS,UMR5292, F-69677 Bron, France";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet";Bastuji, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Cent Integrat Pain NeuroPain Lab, INSERM U1028,CNRS,UMR5292, F-69677 Bron, France.;bastuji@univ-lyon1.fr;;BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707;"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; Labex cortex [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy (SFETD Translational Research Grant 2012-14); Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship; INSERM Interface Grant";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)); Labex cortex; French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy (SFETD Translational Research Grant 2012-14); Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship; INSERM Interface Grant";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Grant/Award Number: Interface Grant for Helene Bastuji; Labex cortex, Grant/Award Number: ANR-11-LABX-0042; ANR-11-IDEX-0007; French Society for Pain Evaluation and Therapy (SFETD Translational Research Grant 2012-14); Region Rhone-Alpes/France ARC2 2012-2015 scholarship; INSERM Interface Grant";;74;0;0;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based probabilistic tractography of deep brain structures that are commonly used for pre- and perioperative targeting for functional neurosurgery. Three targets were reconstructed based on their significance as intervention sites or as a no-go area to avoid adverse side effects: the connections propagating from the thalamus to (1) primary and supplementary motor areas, (2) to somatosensory areas and the cerebello-thalamic tract (CTT). We evaluated the overlap of the reconstructed connectivity based targets with corresponding atlas based data, and tested the inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by acquiring repeated DTI from four volunteers, and on three MRI scanners with similar sequence parameters. Compared to a 3D histological atlas of the human thalamus, moderate overlaps of 35-50% were measured between connectivity-and atlas based volumes, while the minimal distance between the centerpoints of atlas and connectivity targets was 2.5 mm. The variability caused by the MRI scanner was similar to the inter-subject variability, except for connections with the postcentral gyrus where it was higher. While CTT resolved the anatomically correct trajectory of the tract individually, high volumetric variability was found across subjects and between scanners. DTI can be applied in the clinical, preoperative setting to reconstruct the CTT and to localize subdivisions within the lateral thalamus. In our pilot study, such subdivisions moderately matched the borders of the ventrolateral-posteroventral (VLpv) nucleus and the ventral-posterolateral (VPL) nucleus. Limitations of the currently used standard DTI protocols were exacerbated by large scanner-to-scanner variability of the connectivity-based targets.;"[Jakab, Andras; Werner, Beat; Martin, Ernst; Tuura, Ruth O'Gorman] Univ Childrens Hosp, Ctr Magnet Resonance Imaging Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Jakab, Andras] Med Univ Vienna, Computat Imaging Res Lab, Dept Biomed Imaging & Image Guided Therapy, Vienna, Austria; [Piccirelli, Marco] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Neuroradiol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kovacs, Kazmer] Univ Debrecen, Dept Biomed Imaging & Lab Sci, Debrecen, Hungary; [Thornton, John S.; Yousry, Tarek] UCL, Inst Neurol, London, England; [Szekely, Gabor] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Vis Lab, Zurich, Switzerland";"University Children's Hospital Zurich; Medical University of Vienna; University of Zurich; University Zurich Hospital; University of Debrecen; University of London; University College London; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich";"Jakab, A (corresponding author), Univ Childrens Hosp, Ctr Magnet Resonance Imaging Res, Zurich, Switzerland.;Jakab, A (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Computat Imaging Res Lab, Dept Biomed Imaging & Image Guided Therapy, Vienna, Austria.";andras.jakab@kispi.uzh.ch;Jakab, András/U-9436-2019;"Jakab, András/0000-0001-6291-9889; Piccirelli, Marco/0000-0002-3107-4489; O'Gorman, Ruth/0000-0001-5932-7786";"European Union FP7 Marie Curie IEF Research grant FABRIC - Formation and Adaptation of the Brain Connectome, [2012-PIEF-GA-33003]; UCL/ZNZ";"European Union FP7 Marie Curie IEF Research grant FABRIC - Formation and Adaptation of the Brain Connectome,; UCL/ZNZ";AJ is supported by the European Union FP7 Marie Curie IEF Research grant FABRIC - , exploring the Formation and Adaptation of the Brain Connectome, grant no. 2012-PIEF-GA-33003.

In this short review, I reconsider known anatomic features of corticothalamic connectivity, primarily for macaque monkey, and discuss these as part of an intricate network architecture consistent with multiple connectional recombinations and a diversity of functional tasks. Drawing mainly on results from single axon analysis for the two broad classes of corticothalamic (CT) connections, I review the strikingly complementary spatial parameters of their extrinsic CT arbors in relation to intrinsic cortical collaterals. That is, CT neurons in layer 5 (class II) have spatially compact (low divergent) thalamic fields, but highly spatially divergent cortical collaterals. In contrast, CT neurons in layer 6 (class I) have highly divergent thalamic fields, but delimited, low divergent cortical collaterals. CT convergence in the thalamus is technically more difficult to analyze, but one can infer a low convergence of terminations from layer 5, in contrast with CT terminations from layer 6, which are highly convergent. Reciprocating thalamocortical (TC) axons have multiple clustered and divergent arbors. What to conclude from these relationships requires further investigation of activity patterns and networks under different conditions. Specific parameters are suggestive of selective recruitment of distributed postsynaptic networks and ordered activity sequences; but are these separable systems, operating cooperatively or in parallel (L.5 low divergent/low convergent vs. L. 6 high divergent/high convergent)?";[Rockland, Kathleen S.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St 1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA;Boston University;Rockland, KS (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 East Concord St 1004, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;krock@bu.edu;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;57;9;9;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Whether similar dynamics apply to the thalamus and in particular to the pulvinar is largely unknown. Here, we examined electrophysiological recordings from two adult rhesus macaques performing a perceptual task and comparatively investigated trial-to-trial variability in higher-order thalamus (ventral and dorsal pulvinar), the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex (area V4) prior to and following the presentation of a visual stimulus. We found spiking variability during stable fixation prior to stimulus onset to be considerably lower in both pulvinar and the LGN as compared to area V4. In contrast to the prominent variability reduction in V4 upon stimulus onset, variability in the thalamic nuclei was largely unaffected by visual stimulation. There was a small but significant variability decrease in the dorsal pulvinar, but not in the ventral portion of the pulvinar, which is closely connected to visual cortices and would thus have been expected to reflect cortical response properties. This dissociation did not stem from differences in response strength or mean firing rates and indicates fundamental differences in variability quenching between thalamus and cortex.;"[Poland, E.; Wilke, M.] UMG, Dept Cognit Neurol, Robert Koch Str 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany; [Donner, T.

AGRP is transcribed primarily in the adrenal and hypothalamus and is a high affinity antagonist of the neural melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors. The perikarya expressing AGRP messenger RNA are found in the arcuate nucleus of the rat and rhesus monkey. Using a polyclonal antibody against the pharmacologically active domain of AGRP (amino acids 83-132), we have also characterized the distribution of AGRP-immunoreactive neurons in both species. The major fiber tracts are conserved in both species, with dense projections originating in the arcuate nucleus and proceeding along the third ventricle. Dense fiber bundles are also visible in the paraventricular, dorsomedial, and posterior nuclei in the hypothalamus, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and in the lateral septal nucleus of the septal region. hGRP-containing neurons are not visualized in a number of areas, including portions of the amygdala, thalamus, and brain stem, that express MC3-R and MC4-R messenger RNA and receive innervation from POMC neurons that serve as the source of melanocortin agonists. Thus, AGRP is most likely to be involved in modulating a conserved subset of the physiological functions of central melanocortin peptides. Based on the particular distribution of AGRP neurons, those functions are likely to include the central control of energy homeostasis.;"Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst L474, Portland, OR 97201 USA; Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Reg Primate Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; Phoenix Pharmaceut Inc, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA";"Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center";Cone, RD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Vollum Inst L474, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97201 USA.;cone@ohsu.edu;Cameron, Judy L/J-6682-2013;Cameron, Judy/0000-0003-4707-4421;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00163] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD-14643] Funding Source: Medline; NIDDK NIH HHS [DK-51730] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NIDDK NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK))";;;39;201;205;0;6;ENDOCRINE SOC;CHEVY CHASE;8401 CONNECTICUT AVE, SUITE 900, CHEVY CHASE, MD 20815-5817 USA;0013-7227;1945-7170;;ENDOCRINOLOGY;Endocrinology;MAR;1999;140;3;;;;;1408;1415;;10.1210/en.140.3.1408;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/en.140.3.1408;;;8;Endocrinology & Metabolism;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Endocrinology & Metabolism;169EC;10067869;hybrid;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000078733700050;View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neuron's receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a response vector whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19-26%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 +/- 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response.";SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo";Bender, DB (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Sch Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, 329 Cary Hall, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.;;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY-02254] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-32936] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;92;76;78;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.;"[Schwab, Bettina C.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurophysiol & Pathophysiol, Hamburg, Germany; [Schwab, Bettina C.] Univ Twente, Tech Med Ctr, Enschede, Netherlands; [Kase, Daisuke; Turner, Robert S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Kase, Daisuke; Rubin, Jonathan E.; Turner, Robert S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Zimnik, Andrew] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Rosenbaum, Robert] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Appl & Computat Math & Stat, South Bend, IN USA; [Codianni, Marcello G.; Rubin, Jonathan E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Math, Pittsburgh, PA USA";"University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Twente; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Columbia University; University of Notre Dame; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";"Turner, RS (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.;Turner, RS (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neural Basis Cognit, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.";rturner@pitt.edu;"Turner, Robert S/A-9695-2008; Schwab, Bettina C./D-9126-2015";"Turner, Robert S/0000-0002-6074-4365; Schwab, Bettina C./0000-0003-1428-4836; Kase, Daisuke/0000-0001-6787-5862; Rubin, Jonathan/0000-0002-1513-1551; Rosenbaum, Robert/0000-0003-2105-9282";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health [R01NS091853, R01NS113817, R01NS070865]; NSF [DMS1516288, DMS1724240, DMS-1654268, Neuronex DBI-1707400]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [613.009.012]; Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN) [1P30NS076405-01A1]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN)";This work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health grant numbers R01NS091853, R01NS113817 (to RST) and R01NS070865 (to RST and JER), NSF awards DMS1516288 and DMS1724240 (to JER), the Center for Neuroscience Research in Non-human primates (CNRN), 1P30NS076405-01A1, NSF awards DMS-1654268 and Neuronex DBI-1707400 (to RR), and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, NDNS+ grant 613.009.012).

To address this knowledge gap, we examined serially sectioned cholinergic axons in supra- and infragranular layers of the macaque prefrontal cortex by using an antibody against the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The tissue bound antibody was visualized with both immunoperoxidase and silver-enhanced diaminobenzidine sulfide (SEDS) techniques. Both methods revealed that cholinergic axons make synapses in all cortical layers and that these synapses are exclusively symmetric. Cholinergic axons formed synapses primarily on dendritic shafts (70.5%), dendritic spines (25%), and, to a lesser extent, cell bodies (4.5%). Both pyramidal neurons and cells exhibiting the morphological features of GABAergic cells were targets of the cholinergic innervation. Some spiny dendritic shafts received multiple, closely spaced synapses, suggesting that a subset of pyramidal neurons may be subject to a particularly strong cholinergic influence. Analysis of synaptic incidence of cholinergic profiles in the supragranular layers of the prefrontal cortex by the SEDS technique revealed that definitive synaptic junctions were formed by 44% of the cholinergic boutons. An unexpected finding was that cholinergic boutons were frequently apposed to spines and small dendrites without making any visible synaptic specializations. These same spines and dendrites often received asymmetric synapses, presumably of thalamocortical or corticocortical origin. Present ultrastructural findings suggest that acetylcholine may have a dual modulatory effect in the neocortex: one through classical synaptic junctions on dendritic shafts and spines, and the other through nonsynaptic appositions in close vicinity to asymmetric synapses. Further physiological studies are necessary to test the hypothesis of the nonsynaptic release of acetylcholine in the cortex.

To compare the expression of cholinesterases in the human thalamus, the distributions of BuChE and AChE activity were studied by using a modified Karnovsky-Roots method. BuChE activity was present mainly in neurons, whereas AChE activity was present in both neurons and axons. There was intense staining for BuChE or AChE throughout the thalamus, with some nuclei primarily expressing one or the other cholinesterase. BuChE staining was most intense and widespread in neurons in the anteroventral, mediodorsal, ventral, lateral, and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. AChE was predominantly expressed in neurons of the anterodorsal, midline, ventral, intralaminar, and reticular nuclei. Many nuclei contained both cholinesterases. Considering the overall patterns of labeling in the thalamus for the two cholinesterases, there were both complementary and overlapping relationships of BuChE and AChE activity. Neuronal staining in the subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamus was predominantly positive for AChE activity. The distinct distribution of BuChE activity in neurons in the human thalamus is consistent with an important role for this enzyme in neurotransmission in the human nervous system. Furthermore, BuChE activity, like AChE activity, is found in certain thalamic nuclei related to cognitive and behavioral functions. Involvement of thalamic nuclei in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia suggests that BuChE could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these disorders.

By combining Bayesian model selection with dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, a novel analysis approach that allows inferring the causality between neural activities in different brain areas, we demonstrate that salient sensory information reaches the multimodal cortical areas responsible for its detection directly from the thalamus, without being first processed in primary and secondary sensory-specific areas. This direct thalamocortical transmission of multimodal salient information is parallel to the processing of finer stimulus attributes, which are transmitted in a modality-specific fashion from the thalamus to the relevant primary sensory areas. Such direct thalamocortical connections bypassing primary sensory cortices provide a fast and efficient way for transmitting information from subcortical structures to multimodal cortical areas, to allow the early detection of salient events and, thereby, trigger immediate and appropriate behavior.;"[Liang, M.; Iannetti, G.

The same animals were also trained in object-reward association memory. Following bilateral ablations of almost the entire magnocellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the animals were impaired both in scene memory and in object-reward association memory. These results, combined with recent results in object recognition memory from monkeys with mediodorsal thalamic lesions, show that the impairment produced by this lesion is more general, affecting a broader range of memory tasks, than the impairment which is produced in monkeys by lesions restricted to the hippocampus-fornix-mamillary system. It is also more severe than the effect of lesions limited to the medial part of the magnocellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. These findings extend the evidence that the magnocellular division of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus has an important and general role in memory, and they are consistent with the proposal that lesions of the magnocellular division of that nucleus have their effect by disrupting the function of prefrontal cortex.;Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England;University of Oxford;Gaffan, D (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England.;;;;;;;;48;63;63;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;;;BRAIN;Brain;APR;2000;123;;4;;;;816;827;;10.1093/brain/123.4.816;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.4.816;;;12;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;300KD;10734012;Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000086251400016;View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantitative evaluation of connections examined with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers indicated that both gyri received strong thalamic projections from the medial geniculate body (MG) and the lateromedial-suprageniculate (LM-Sg) complex, and a weaker projection from the posterior (Po) nuclei. On the basis of the connectivity patterns and cytoarchitectonic features we distinguished the anterior (CPa) and posterior (CPp) areas in posterior composite gyrus and the anterior (SA), dorsal (SD) and posterior (SP) sylvian areas. Afferents from individual thalamic nuclei were focused in distinct areas, forming dominant projections, and diminished gradually in the adjacent areas as non-dominant projections. The most prominent MG projection arose from the dorsal caudal (MGdc) nucleus. Its ventral subdivision sent a dominant projection into the SP and CPa, whereas the dorsal MGdc subdivision was connected with the SA, SD and CPp areas. The most substantial connections from the LM-Sg complex were directed to areas SA, SD and CPp, with weak connections to areas CPa and SP. A gradient of density of LM-Sg afferents was distributed in the opposite direction to that sent from the MGdc. The origin of the CPa and SP afferents in the ventral MGdc, like connections reaching the posterior ectosylvian cortex, suggest that these areas are related to processing of auditory information. In contrast, areas SA and Up, receive dominant projections from the polymodal LM-Sg, and therefore may constitute successive steps in a hierarchy of cortical areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates. In addition, these results provide further evidence for proposed subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar.

We examined the reliability of this marker in identifying and discriminating thalamic terminals in adult and developing ferret visual cortex. We studied brain sections stained for the transporter protein and/or anterogradely filled thalamocortical or intracortical axons, by using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Under light microscopy, VGluT2 immunoreactivity (ir) in adult animals [past postnatal day (P)90] and in neonatal animals as early as P27 formed a dense band in layer 4 and appeared as scattered puncta in layers 6 and 1. Confocal dual-labeling analyses of P46 and adult striate cortices indicated that VGluT2 was present in thalamocortical axons, suggesting that thalamic projections utilize this transporter during postnatal development as well as adulthood. In contrast, extracellularly filled intracortical axons failed to colocalize with VGluT2-ir, suggesting that no significant terminal population originating in cortex contained VGluT2 in layer 4. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that, in adult layer 4, VGluT2-ir was present in large terminals, forming asymmetric synapses. Similar to anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals, VGluT2-ir synaptic terminals were different from their unlabeled counterparts in terms of terminal area (0.6 vs. 0.3 mu m), synaptic length (486 vs. 353 nm), and preference for synapsing on spines (77% vs. 59%). Moreover, no significant differences were found between VGluT2-ir and anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals. Comparable similarities were also demonstrated at P46. These results indicate that thalamocortical terminals in layer 4 of visual cortex utilize VGluT2 and suggest that this marker can be used to identify thalamic axons specifically in adult and developing animals.

That each of these cortical areas has a unique thalamic input was illustrated in the preceding paper. In the present experiments the cortical afferent projections to these 3 areas of the sensorimotor cortex monkey were visualized and compared, using 4 differentiable fluorescent dyes as axonal retrogradely transported labels. The cortical projection patterns to areas 3a, 3b, and 4 were similar in that they each consisted of (a) a ''halo'' of input from the immediately surrounding cortex, and (b) discrete projections from one or more remote cortical areas. However, the pattern of remote inputs from precentral, mesial, and posterior parietal cortex was different for each of the 3 cortical target areas. The cortical input configuration was least complex for area 3b, its remote input projecting mainly from insular cortex. The pattern of discrete cortical inputs to the motor area 4, however, was more complex, with projections from the cingulate motor area (24c/d), the supplementary motor area, postarcuate cortex, insular cortex, and postcentral areas 2/5. Area 3a, in addition to the proximal projections from the immediately surrounding cortex, also received input from the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, insular cortex, and areas 2/5. Thus, this pattern of cortical input to area 3a resembled more closely that of the adjacent motor rather than that of the somatosensory area 3b. Contrasting with this, however, the thalamic input to area 3a was largely from somatosensory VPLc (abbreviations from Olszewski [1952] The Thalamus of the Macaca mulatta. Basel: Karger) and not from VPLo (with input from cerebellum, and projecting to precentral motor areas).

We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of V1 cortex between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different Lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque primary visual cortex rather than convergent evolution of these features.

However, there is relatively little evidence detailing the interactions between mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex linked to cognition in primates. This study investigated these interactions during learning, memory, and decision-making tasks in rhesus monkeys using a disconnection lesion approach. Preoperatively, monkeys learned object-in-place scene discriminations embedded within colorful visual backgrounds. Unilateral neurotoxic lesions to magnocellular mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impaired the ability to learn new object-in-place scene discriminations. In contrast, unilateral ablations to ventrolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex (PFv+o) left learning intact. A second unilateral MDmc or PFv+o lesion in the contralateral hemisphere to the first operation, causing functional MDmc-PFv+o disconnection across hemispheres, further impaired learning object-in-place scene discriminations, although object discrimination learning remained intact. Adaptive decision-making after reward satiety devaluation was also reduced. These data highlight the functional importance of interactions between MDmc and PFv+o during learning object-in-place scene discriminations and adaptive decision-making but not object discrimination learning.

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources.

Methods: Motor excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques and electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. Motor function was evaluated by the Nine-Hole-Peg Test and measurement of hand grip strength. The affected side was compared with the non-lesioned side and with an age-matched control group. Results: Patients had a loss of inhibition and an increase of facilitation in the motor cortex of the affected side. The silent period was prolonged and motor function was impaired on the affected side. Conclusions: A thalamic lesion can modulate motor cortical excitability. Significance: This study suggests that, under normal conditions, somatosensory afferents influence inhibitory and excitatory properties in the motor cortex.

To optimize this approach, we proposed to study the involvement of this nucleus in a non-human primate model of mesial temporal lobe seizure. Two macaques were implanted with one chronic electrode into the hippocampus allowing to monitor the ictal activity. Neurons of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus were recorded with a microelectrode inserted acutely. To induce seizures, penicillin was injected into the hippocampus and neuronal activities of the anterior nucleus were analyzed during ictal and interictal periods. The effects of the chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus on the ictal hippocampal activities were studied and electron microscopy analysis was carried out to study morphological modifications induced in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results demonstrate that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is directly involved in the pathophysiology of induced seizures since: (1) Electrophysiological study showed an heterogenous excitation during seizure characterized by the appearance of 2 types of neuronal firing response; (2) chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus changed the severity of seizures; (3) morphological modification of the ultrastructure as well as a reduction of synapse density were observed within the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This study demonstrates that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the epileptic network activated during temporal lobe seizures and suggests that this nucleus would be valid target for seizure control using deep brain stimulation.

However, recent studies in the monkey have documented projections from MD to the more caudal, agranular regions of the frontal cortex, suggesting that the connections of MD may be characterized by a breadth of distribution and diversity of functional roles too great to be useful as a unifying and defining feature for a specific cortical territory. In this study, we placed tracer injections in the lateral divisions of MD in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the relative proportions of connections devoted to diverse regions of the frontal cortex (FC). Three different patterns of label were observed in the cortex, associated with different locations within lateral MD. We have designated these as the ventrolateral MD-arcuate FC circuit, having most label in areas 8 and 6; the caudoventral MD-dorsomedial FC circuit, having most label in areas 24 and presupplementary motor area (SMA); and the anterodorsal MD-anterior FC circuit, with the most label in areas 9, 46, 12, and 10. Only two of the nine cases injected in lateral MD were predominantly connected with the anterior FC. Thus, particular locales within lateral MD are connected with multiple, functionally diverse cortical regions, including several not classically recognized as prefrontal areas. This divergence may distinguish MD-frontocortical and reciprocal corticothalamic pathways from the largely segregated pathways arising from the other thalamic nuclei that are interconnected with the frontal cortex, such as those from the ventrolateral nuclear group.

All areas of the neocortex receive afferent input from and send efferent projections to specific thalamic nuclei. Through these connections, the thalamus serves to provide the cortex with sensory input, and to facilitate interareal cortical communication and motor and cognitive functions. In the visual system, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus is the gateway through which visual information reaches the cerebral cortex. Visual processing in the LGN includes spatial and temporal influences on visual signals that serve to adjust response gain, transform the temporal structure of retinal activity patterns, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the retinal signal while preserving its basic content. This review examines recent advances in our understanding of LGN function and circuit organization and places these findings in a historical context.;"[Usrey, W.

Dysfunction of the CT, typically a result of severe brain injury (SBI), leads to long-lasting impairments in arousal regulation and subsequent deficits in cognition. Central thalamic deep brain stimulation (CT-DBS) is proposed as a therapy to reestablish and maintain arousal regulation to improve cognition in select SBI patients. However, a mechanistic understanding of CT-DBS and an optimal method of implementing this promising therapy are unknown. Here we demonstrate in two healthy nonhuman primates (NHPs), Macaca mulatta, that location-specific CT-DBS improves performance in visuomotor tasks and is associated with physiological effects consistent with enhancement of endogenous arousal. Specifically, CT-DBS within the lateral wing of the central lateral nucleus and the surrounding medial dorsal thalamic tegmental tract (DTTm) produces a rapid and robust modulation of performance and arousal, as measured by neuronal activity in the frontal cortex and striatum. Notably, the most robust and reliable behavioral and physiological responses resulted when we implemented a novel method of CT-DBS that orients and shapes the electric field within the DTTm using spatially separated DBS leads. Collectively, our results demonstrate that selective activation within the DTTm of the CT robustly regulates endogenous arousal and enhances cognitive performance in the intact NHP; these findings provide insights into the mechanism of CT-DBS and further support the development of CT-DBS as a therapy for reestablishing arousal regulation to support cognition in SBI patients.";"[Baker, Jonathan L.; Ryou, Jae-Wook; Schiff, Nicholas D.; Purpura, Keith P.] Weill Cornell Med, Feil Family Brain & Mind Res Inst, LC809,1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Wei, Xuefeng F.] Coll New Jersey, Dept Biomed Engn, Ewing Township, NJ USA; [Butson, Christopher R.] Univ Utah, Dept Bioengn, Sci Comp & Imaging SCI Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA";"Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; College of New Jersey; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah";Baker, JL (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med, Feil Family Brain & Mind Res Inst, LC809,1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.;job2037@med.cornell.edu;Butson, Christopher R/J-8034-2013;Butson, Christopher R/0000-0002-2319-1263;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [RO1-NS-067249]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P41-GM-103545-17]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))";The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke supported this work under Grant RO1-NS-067249.

This is in part because spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons that project to the posterior thalamus have received little attention. In this study, antidromic mapping was used to identify individual STT neurons with axons that projected specifically to the posterior thalamus in Macaca fascicularis. Each axon was located by antidromic activation at low stimulus amplitudes (<30 mu A) and was then surrounded distally by a grid of stimulating points in which 500-mu A stimuli were unable to activate the axon antidromically, thereby indicating the termination zone. Several nuclei within the posterior thalamus were targets of STT neurons: the posterior nucleus, suprageniculate nucleus, magnocellular part of the medial geniculate nucleus, and limitans nucleus. STT neurons projecting to the ventral posterior inferior nucleus were also studied. Twenty-five posterior thalamus-projecting STT neurons recorded in lumbar spinal cord were characterized by their responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Sixteen of 25 neurons were recorded in the marginal zone and the balance was located within the deep dorsal horn. Thirteen neurons were classified as wide dynamic range and 12 as high threshold. One-third of STT neurons projecting to posterior thalamus responded to noxious heat (50 degrees C). Two-thirds of those tested responded to cooling. Seventy-one percent responded to an intradermal injection of capsaicin. These data indicate that the primate STT transmits noxious and innocuous mechanical, thermal, and chemical information to multiple posterior thalamic nuclei.;"[Davidson, Steve; Zhang, Xijing; Giesler, Glenn J., Jr.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Khasabov, Sergey G.; Simone, Donald A.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Dent, Dept Diagnost & Biol Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Davidson, Steve; Simone, Donald A.; Giesler, Glenn J., Jr.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Grad Program Neurosci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities";Giesler, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, 6-145 Jackson Hall,321 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;giesler@umn.edu;;Davidson, Steve/0000-0003-2944-1144;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants [NS-047399, NS-059199]; Graduate School of the University of Minnesota";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Graduate School of the University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System)";This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants NS-047399 and NS-059199 and by the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota.;;92;14;14;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

However, their functional relationship remains to be elucidated. Here, we employ resting-state functional MRI to investigate the temporal correlations of spontaneous fluctuations between the thalamus [the whole thalamus and its three largest nuclei (bilateral mediodorsal, ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei)] and visual cortex under both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The whole thalamus show negative correlations with the visual cortex and positive correlations with its contralateral counterpart in eyes closed condition, but which are significantly decreased in eyes open condition, consistent with previous findings of electroencephalography desynchronization during eyes open resting state. Furthermore, we find that bilateral thalamic mediodorsal nuclei and bilateral ventrolateral nuclei have remarkably similar connectivity maps, and resemble to those of the whole thalamus, suggesting their crucial contributions to the thalamus-visual correlations. The bilateral pulvinar nuclei are found to show distinct functional connectivity patterns, compatible with previous findings of the asymmetry of anatomical and functional organization in the nuclei. Our data provides evidence for the associations of intrinsic spontaneous neuronal activity between the thalamus and visual cortex under different resting conditions, which might have implications on the understanding of the generation and modulation of the alpha rhythm.

Iontophoretic injections guided by physiological recordings were restricted to lamina I or laminae I-II. PHA-L-labeled trigemino- and spinothalamic (TSTT) terminations were identified imimmohistochemically. TRITC- and FITC-labeled dextrans were injected at different levels to confirm topography. Terminations consistently occurred in two main locations: a distinguishable portion of posterolateral thalamus identified cytoarchitectonically as the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo) and a portion of posteromedial thalamus designated as the ventral caudal part of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDvc). In addition, isolated fibers bearing boutons of passage were observed in the ventral posterior medial and lateral (VPM and VPL) nuclei, and spinal terminations occurred in the ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI). Isolated terminations occasionally occurred in other sites (e.g., suprageniculate, zona incerta, hypothalamic paraventricular n.). Terminations in MDvc occurred in concise foci that were weakly organized topographically (posteroanterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo consisted of dense clusters of ramified terminal arbors bearing multiple large boutons that were well organized topographically (anteroposterior = rostrocaudal). Terminations in VMpo colocalized with a field of calbindin-immunoreactive terminal fibers; double-labeled terminals were documented at high magnification. This propitious marker was especially useful at anterior levels, where VMpo can easily be misidentified as VPM. These findings demonstrate phylogenetically novel primate lamina I TSTT projections important for sensory and motivational aspects of pain, temperature, itch, muscle ache, sensual touch, and other interoceptive feelings from the body.

It is divided into multiple subnuclei with different cortical connections. The medial dorsal (MD) nucleus is particularly important because it forms key connections with the prefrontal cortex. The current study reports precise and efficient methods for measuring the whole thalamus and the MD with MRI that have a high degree of interrater reliability. A multispectral image acquisition and novel image processing technique were used to improve structure visibility. The tricolor image assigns a color to each of the T1, T2, and PD weighted images, represented by red, green, and blue, respectively. The manually defined regions were then used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically define both. the whole thalamus and the MD. The ANN provides an efficient automated method, making studies using larger sample sizes more feasible.

In this way, prosimian primates, close relatives of simian primates, and tree shrews differ markedly from monkeys in which S-II is deactivated by comparable ablations, and resemble such mammals as cats and rabbits in which S-II also remains highly responsive following ablations in S-I. Thus, it appears that the generalized mammalian condition is that S-I and S-II are independently activated via parallel thalamocortical pathways. A dependence of S-II on serial connections from the thalamus to the S-I region and then to S-II apparently evolved with the advent of anthropoid primates, and may be present only in monkeys and perhaps other higher primates.;;;GARRAGHTY, PE (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NASHVILLE,TN 37240, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS16446] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;69;53;53;0;4;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.;"[Magrou, Loic; Giroud, Pascale; Berland, Michel; Knoblauch, Kenneth; Dehay, Colette; Kennedy, Henry] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, U1208,Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst, F-69500 Bron, France; [Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Barone, Pascal] CNRS, UMR 5549, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31059 Toulouse, France; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Killackey, Herbert P.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Kennedy, Henry] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Princeton University; Princeton University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Chinese Academy of Sciences";"Dehay, C; Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, U1208,Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst, F-69500 Bron, France.;Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China.";"colette.dehay@inserm.fr; henry.kennedy@inserm.fr";"Dehay, Colette/H-4437-2014; Knoblauch, Kenneth/H-8156-2014; Markov, Nikola/AAI-9680-2020; Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009; Kennedy, Henry/B-9636-2013; Markov, Nikola T./AFO-2802-2022";"Dehay, Colette/0000-0002-5196-1464; Knoblauch, Kenneth/0000-0002-4681-4638; Barone, Pascal/0000-0003-0125-7468; Kennedy, Henry/0000-0002-2796-7663; Markov, Nikola T./0000-0003-1417-1161";"LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; CORE-NETS [ANR-11-BSV4-501]; ARCHI-CORE [ANR-14-CE13-0033]; CORNET [ANR-15-CE32-0016]; CORTICITY [ANR-17-HBPR-0003];  [ANR-17-NEUC-0004];  [A2P2MC]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-HBPR-0003] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)";"LABEX CORTEX of Universite de Lyon; CORE-NETS; ARCHI-CORE; CORNET; CORTICITY; ; ; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042) of Universite de Lyon (ANR-11-IDEX-0007) operated by the French National Research Agency (ANR) (H.K.), ANR-11-BSV4-501, CORE-NETS (H.K.), ANR-14-CE13-0033, ARCHI-CORE (H.K.), ANR-15-CE32-0016, CORNET (H.K.), ANR-17-NEUC-0004, A2P2MC (H.K.), ANR-17-HBPR-0003, CORTICITY (H.K.).;;122;13;13;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

One hundred 5-HT immunoreactive terminals from the cat and approximately forty 5-HT and TH immunoreactive terminals from the monkey were selected for analysis in serial thin sections. Only 7-10% of the immunoreactive terminals could be revealed to form conventional synaptic contacts. Most of these could be identified as the asymmetrical type. Dendritic shafts belonging to relay neurons were the major targets of these monoamine immunoreactive terminals. The remainder made intimate membrane associations with relay cell dendrites and somata or with presynaptic dendrites of interneurons, but no overt membrane specializations could be detected.

In all of the tasks tested, T-maze alternation, radial arm maze, and Morris water maze, those animals with lesions placed in the contralateral hemispheres were more impaired than those animals with lesions in the same hemisphere.

Here we report the results of quantitative PET studies of cerebral nAChRs with 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 (2-[F-18]FA) in rhesus monkeys. Data from dynamic PET scans were analyzed using graphical methods. Binding potential (BP) values of 2.0, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.03 observed in the thalamus (Th), cortex (Cx), striatum (Str), and cerebellum (Cb), respectively, were consistent with the pattern of alpha(4)beta(2), nAChR distribution in monkey brain. The high value of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding in the rhesus monkey Th and low level of that in Cb compared with nonspecific accumulation of radioactivity in these structures allowed use of Cb as a reference region for calculation of BP and volume of distribution of specific binding (VDsb) in Th by graphical methods, both with and without the plasma input function. In contrast, estimation of 2[F-18]FA specific binding in low-receptor-density regions such as Cx and Str required assessment of nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VDnd) in a separate study and measurement of nonmetabolized radioligand concentrations in the plasma. For accurate quantitation of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding by graphical analysis, PET studies should last up to 7 h due to the slow kinetics of 2[F-18]FA brain distribution. Further, to avoid substantial underestimation in measured BP values the doses of administered 2-[F-18]FA should not exceed 0.1 nmol/kg body weight. The findings suggest that 2-[F-18]FA is a promising ligand for quantitation of nAChRs in human brain.;NIDA, Neuroimaging Res Branch, Intramural Res Program, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)";Mukhin, AG (corresponding author), NIDA, Neuroimaging Res Branch, Intramural Res Program, 5500 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.;;;;;;;;21;69;69;0;4;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA;0887-4476;;;SYNAPSE;Synapse;APR;2003;48;1;;;;;25;34;;10.1002/syn.10180;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/syn.10180;;;10;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;650DQ;12557269;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000181247700004;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the pattern of shape change associated with such volume loss has not been investigated. In this study, alterations in thalamic volume, shape, and symmetry were compared in subjects with and without schizophrenia. Method: T-1-weighted magnetic resonance scans were collected in 52 schizophrenia and 65 comparison subjects matched for age, gender, race, and parental socioeconomic status. High-dimensional (large-deformation) brain mapping was used to assess thalamic morphology. Results: Significant differences in thalamic volume, deformities of thalamic shape at the anterior and posterior extremes of the structure, and a significant exaggeration of thalamic asymmetry (i.e., left smaller than right) were found in the schizophrenia subjects. After covarying for total cerebral volume, the difference in thalamic volume became insignificant. When information about thalamic shape was combined with previously collected information about hippocampal shape, the discrimination between schizophrenia patients and comparison subjects was improved. Conclusions: Thalamic volume was smaller than normal in schizophrenia patients, but only proportionate to reductions in reduced total cerebral volume. The presence of changes in thalamic shape and asymmetry suggest greater pathologic involvement of individual nuclei at its anterior and posterior extremes of the thalamic complex.;"Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Biostat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Metropolitan St Louis Psychiat Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD USA";"Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Yale University; Johns Hopkins University";Csernansky, JG (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Box 8134,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;jgc@conte.wustl.edu;"wang, le/HKN-3406-2023; Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013; Schindler, Matthew/ABG-6790-2020; Miller, Michael I./A-3213-2010";"Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388; Schindler, Matthew/0000-0003-0157-5669; ";NIMH NIH HHS [MH-56584, MH-62130] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;55;126;131;0;11;AMER PSYCHIATRIC PRESS, INC;ARLINGTON;1000 WILSON BOULEVARD, STE 1825, ARLINGTON, VA 22209-3901 USA;0002-953X;;;AM J PSYCHIAT;Am.

In addition, this view stales that striatal output reaches the basal ganglia output nuclei (the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GP(i))) via a 'direct' pathway and via an 'indirect pathway' which traverses the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP,) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the topographical relationships of GP(e) and STN, and their topographical relationships with the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, are still unclear. The present work reviewed primate data on the topographical organization of STN afferents from GP(e), and STN efferents to the pallidum, striatum and SNR, and examined these data with respect to a tripartite (motor, associative and limbic) functional subdivision of the striatum and pallidum. This examination indicated the following. (I) On the basis of its efferent connections, the STN may be divided into a motor and an associative territories, as well as a smaller limbic territory, each projecting to corresponding areas in the pallidum and striatum. (2) Efferents from GP(e) are in a position to contact subthalamic cells projecting to GP(i)/SNR, thus providing anatomical support for the existence of indirect pathways. (3) Moreover, given the tripartite division of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, the available data indicate the existence of indirect pathways connecting functionally corresponding subregions of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, as well as indirect pathways connecting functionally non-corresponding subregions. On the basis of the above we suggested that there may be two types of indirect pathways, one which terminates in the same subregion in GP(i)/SNR as the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion, and another which terminates in a different GP(i)/SNR subregion than the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion. We termed the former a 'closed indirect pathway' and the latter an 'open indirect pathway'. The application of these concepts to the surveyed data suggested the existence of three closed indirect pathways, each connecting the corresponding functional (motor, associative, and limbic) regions of the striatum, pallidum, STN, and SNR, as well as of two open indirect pathways, one connecting the associative striatum to the motor subregions of the basal ganglia, and the other connecting the associative striatum to the limbic subregions of the basal ganglia. While the organization of the closed indirect pathways fits the closed segregated arrangement of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, the organization of the open indirect pathways fits the recently suggested open interconnected scheme of basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry. The clinical implications of this scheme for Huntington's disease are discussed.;TEL AVIV UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, IL-69978 TEL AVIV, ISRAEL;Tel Aviv University;;;Weiner, Irving D/G-6333-2016;"Weiner, Irving D/0000-0002-0046-0600; Joel, Daphna/0000-0002-2003-4190";;;;;116;195;201;1;18;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0165-0173;1872-6321;;BRAIN RES REV;Brain Res.

A fragment, from the transmembrane segments MIII to MIV of Macaca neuronal nAChR subunits was cloned, and shown to exhibit high identity (around 95%) to the corresponding human subunits. Then, specific oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized for in situ hybridization experiments. Both alpha 4 and beta 2 mRNA signals were widely distributed in the brain, being stronger in the thalamus and in the dopaminergic cells of the mesencephalon. Most brain nuclei displayed both alpha 4 and beta 2 signals with the exception of some basal ganglia regions and the reticular thalamic nucleus which were devoid of alpha 4 signal. alpha 6 and beta 3 mRNA signals were selectively concentrated in the substantia nigra and the medial habenula. The strongest signals for alpha 3 or beta 4 mRNAs were found in the epithalamus (medial habenula and pineal gland), whereas there were no specific alpha 3 or beta 4 signals in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. alpha 5 and alpha 7 mRNA signals were found in several brain areas, including cerebral cortex, thalamus and substantia nigra, although at a lower level than alpha 4 and beta 2. The distribution of alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, alpha 6, alpha 7, beta 2, beta 3 and beta 4 subunit mRNAs in the monkey is substantially similar to that observed in rodent brain. Surprisingly, alpha 2 mRNA signal was largely distributed in the Macaca brain, at levels comparable with those of alpha 4 and beta 2. This observation represents the main difference between rodent and Macaca subunit mRNA distribution and suggests that, besides alpha 4 beta 2*, alpha 2 beta 2* nAChRs constitute a main nAChR isoform in primate brain.;Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2182, F-75724 Paris 15, France;"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Institut Pasteur Paris";Changeux, JP (corresponding author), Inst Pasteur, CNRS, URA 2182, 25-28 Rue Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris 15, France.;changeux@pasteur.fr;"Le Novère, Nicolas/F-9973-2010; Zoli, Michele/C-8899-2016";"Le Novère, Nicolas/0000-0002-6309-7327; Zoli, Michele/0000-0002-8034-2849";;;;;81;126;129;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Most LGN neurons are monocular in that they are activated by visual stimulation through only one (dominant) eye. However, there are both intrinsic connections and inputs from binocular structures to the LGN that could provide these neurons with signals originating from the other (non-dominant) eye. Indeed, previous work introducing luminance differences across the eyes or using a single-contrast stimulus showed binocular modulation for single unit activity in anesthetized macaques and multiunit activity in awake macaques. Here, we sought to determine the influence of contrast viewed by both the non-dominant and dominant eyes on LGN single-unit responses in awake macaques. To do this, we adjusted each eye's signal strength by independently varying the contrast of stimuli presented to the two eyes. Specifically, we recorded LGN single unit spiking activity in two awake macaques while they viewed drifting gratings of varying contrast. We found that LGN neurons of all types [parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K)] were significantly suppressed when stimuli were presented at low contrast to the dominant eye and at high contrast to the non-dominant eye. Further, the inputs of the two eyes showed antagonistic interaction, whereby the magnitude of binocular suppression diminished with high contrast in the dominant eye, or low contrast in the non-dominant eye.

Activated macrophages and microglia in white matter along with the hallmark multinucleated giant cells are prominent features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and of several simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) models. While infected microglia have been demonstrated in HIVE, this feature is not routinely seen in experimental infections in rhesus macaques using SIV or chimeric simian/HIV (SHIV) strains, limiting utility in HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment studies. Here, 50 rhesus macaques were inoculated with the CCR5 (R5)-tropic SHIVSF162P3N virus by one of three routes: intravenously (n = 9), intrarectally (n = 17), or intravaginally (n = 24). Forty-three monkeys became viremic, 26 developed AIDS, and 7 (7/26, 27 %) developed giant cell SIV encephalitis (SIVE). Rapid progressor phenotype was evident in five of seven (71 %) macaques with SIVE, and expansion to utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 coreceptor switch) was observed in four out of seven (57 %). SIVE lesions were present in gray and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, and brain stem of affected animals. Lesions were composed of virally infected CD68(+), CD163(+), and HLA-DR+ macrophages accompanied by white matter damage, necrosis, and astroglial and microglial activation. Importantly, microglial infection was observed, which makes R5 SHIVSF162P3N infection of macaques an attractive animal model not only to study transmission and HIVE pathogenesis but also to conduct preclinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating HIV-1 from the central nervous system (CNS).;"[Harbison, Carole; Knight, Heather; Westmoreland, Susan] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Med & Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [Zhuang, Ke; Gettie, Agegnehu; Cheng-Mayer, Cecilia] Aaron Diamond AIDS Res Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Blanchard, James; Didier, Peter] Tulane Univ, Med Ctr, Tulane Natl Primate Res Ctr, Covington, LA USA";"Harvard University; Tulane University";Westmoreland, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Med & Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.;Susan_westmoreland@hms.harvard.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [R01AI46980]; Tulane National Primate Research Center Base grant [RR00164]; New England Primate Research Center Base grant [P51OD011103-51]; National Institutes of Health T32 training grant [T32OD011064]";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Tulane National Primate Research Center Base grant; New England Primate Research Center Base grant; National Institutes of Health T32 training grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant R01AI46980 (CCM).

Spike activity of 67 neurons (48 simple, 19 complex cells) was extracellulary recorded from area 17/18 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. A total of 107 subfields (on/off) were mapped by applying, a reverse correlation technique to the activity elicited by bright and dark rectangles flashed for 300 ms in a 20 x 10 grid. We found that the width of the (suprathreshold) discharge fields shrank on average by 22% during this 300-ms-long stimulus presentation time. Fifty-eight subfields (54%) shrank by more than 20% of peak width and only ten (less than 10%) showed a slight increase over time. The main size reduction took place 40-60 ms after response onset, which corresponded to the transition from transient peak firing to tonic visual activity in thalamocortical relay cells (TC). The experimentally obtained RFs were then fitted with the aid of a neural field model of the primary visual pathway. Assuming a Gaussian-shaped spatial sensitivity profile across the RF subfield width, the model allowed us to estimate the subthreshold RF (depolarization field, D-field) from the minimal discharge field (MDF). The model allowed us to test to what degree the temporal dynamics of thalamocortical activity contributes to the spatiotemporal changes of cortical RFs. To this end, we performed the fitting procedure either with a pure feedforward model or with a field model that also included intracortical feedback. Spatial and temporal parameters obtained from fits of the experimental RFs matched closely to those achieved by simulating a pure feedforward system with the field model but were not compatible with additional intracortical feedback. Thus, our results show that dot stimulation, which optimally excites thalamocortical cells, leads to a shrinkage with respect to the size of the RF subfield at the first transient response of visual cortical RFs which seems mainly due to a change in the thalamic firing pattern. In these experiments little or no influence from intracortical sources was observed, which, however, may play a role when using more complex visual stimuli.;"Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Physiol, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; Max Planck Inst Math Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Stirling, Dept Psychol, Stirling FK8 4LA, Scotland";"Ruhr University Bochum; Max Planck Society; University of Stirling";Funke, K (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Physiol, Dept Neurophysiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.;;;Funke, Klaus/0000-0003-2359-8917;;;;;54;25;25;0;3;SPRINGER-VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

However, it is unclear how specific thalamic nuclei are affected by these changes in basal ganglia activity. The thalamic parafascicular nucleus (PFN) receives input from basal ganglia Output nuclei and directly projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), striatum and cortex; thus basal ganglia-mediated changes on PFN activity may further impact basal ganglia and cortical functions. To investigate the impact of increased oscillatory activity in basal ganglia output on PFN activity after dopamine cell lesion, PFN single-unit and local field potential activities were recorded in neurologically intact (control) rats and in both non-lesioned and dopamine lesioned hemispheres of unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats anesthetized With urethane. Firing rates were unchanged 1-2 weeks after lesion; however, significantly fewer spontaneously active PFN neurons were evident. Firing pattern assessments after lesion showed that a larger proportion of PFN spike trains had 0.3-2.5 Hz oscillatory activity and significantly fewer spike trains exhibited low threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts. In paired recordings, more PFN-STN spike oscillations were significantly correlated, but as these oscillations were in-phase, results are inconsistent with feedforward control of PFN activity by inhibitory oscillatory basal ganglia output. Furthermore, the decreased incidence of ITS bursts is incompatible with inhibitory basal ganglia output inducing rebound bursting in PFN after dopamine lesion. Together, results show that robust oscillatory activity observed in basal ganglia output nuclei after dopamine cell lesion does not directly drive changes in PFN oscillatory activity.

Calcyon mRNA is found to be abundantly distributed throughout the primate brain. In neocortex, moderately dense, diffuse signal is found in all areas, with increased intensity present in a superficial isodense band corresponding generally to cortical layers II and III. Increased intensity of signal is also seen in the pyramidal cell layers of medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. Calcyon mRNA is present abundantly in subcortical limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Moderate calcyon transcript expression is seen in caudate and putamen, with lower levels in globus pallidus. Thalamic nuclei, including the reticular nucleus, express low to moderate levels. Very dense expression is noted in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Numerous brainstem regions express this transcript, notably monoaminergic nuclei including the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe. The cerebellum has detectable levels of expression in both cortex and deep nuclei. Although calcyon is hypothesized as a means for D1-like receptors to modulate cross-talk with other neurotransmitter receptor systems, it is notable that abundant calcyon transcript is detected in brain regions not associated with D1-like neurotransmission, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta and other dopamine-synthesizing cell groups. A substantial proportion of this may relate to the reported association of calcyon with the D5 receptor, or in addition, may suggest that calcyon has a wider role as a regulator of intracellular signal transduction.

Two subjects alternated between periods of making saccades and central fixations while blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images were collected [3 T, (1.5 mm)(3) spatial resolution]. BOLD activations from each of four cerebral hemispheres were projected onto the subjects' cortical surfaces and aligned to a surface-based atlas for comparison across hemispheres and subjects. This surface-based analysis revealed patterns of visuo-oculomotor activity across much of the cerebral cortex, including activations in the posterior parietal cortex, superior temporal cortex and frontal lobe. For each cortical domain, we show the anatomical position and extent of visuo-oculomotor activity, including evidence that the dorsolateral frontal activation, which includes the frontal eye field (on the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus), extends anteriorly into posterior principal sulcus (area 46) and posteriorly into part of dorsal premotor cortex (area 6). Our results also suggest that subcortical BOLD activity in the pulvinar thalamus may be lateralized during voluntary eye movements.

This atlas is based on multiarchitectonic parcellation in sections parallel or perpendicular to the standard intercommissural reference plane. The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR) were used as neurochemical markers to further characterize thalamic nuclei and delimit subterritories of functional significance for stereotactic explorations. Their overall distribution reveals a subcompartmentalization of thalamic nuclei into several groups. Predominant PV immunostaining characterizes primary somatosensory, visual and auditory nuclei, the ventral lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus (R), and to a lesser degree also, lateral part of the centre median nucleus, and anterior, lateral, and inferior divisions of the pulvinar complex. In contrast, CB immunoreactivity is prevalent in medial thalamic nuclei (intralaminar and midline), the posterior complex, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, the ventral lateral anterior nucleus, ventral anterior, and ventral medial nuclei. The complementary distributions of PV and CB appear to correlate with distinct lemniscal and spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and to cerebellar and pallidal motor territories, respectively. Calretinin, while overlapping with CB in medial thalamic territories, is also expressed in R and limbic associated anterior group nuclei that contain little or no CB. Preliminary analysis indicates that interindividual nuclear variations cannot easily be taken into account by standardization procedures. Nevertheless, some corrections in anteroposterior coordinates in relation to different intercommissural distances are proposed. J. Comp. Neurol. 387:588-630, 1997.

Immunocytochemical analyses, combined with computerized morphometry revealed that in the visual and auditory systems of the bottlenose dolphin, calretinin and calbindin are the prevalent calcium-binding proteins, whereas parvalbumin is present in very few neurons. The prevalence of calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is especially obvious in the auditory system of this species. In both auditory and visual systems of the macaque monkey, the parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons are present in comparable or higher densities than the calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons. In some structures of the visual and auditory systems of the macaque monkey, the calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons are nearly absent. The prevalence of parvalbumin-immunoreactive over calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is particularly prominent in the visual system of primates. Thus, the dominant sensory systems in both aquatic and terrestrial mammals are enriched in specific phenotypes of calcium-binding protein-immunoreactive neurons. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

These neurones project predominantly to the primary motor cortex after relaying in the motor thalamus. Given a) that localised regions of the motor cortex control individual muscles which generally act about single joints and b) the relatively tight topographical arrangement of thalamocortical connections, it is reasonable to hypothesise that if cerebellar output neurones control single-joint movements they are likely to project to localised areas of the motor thalamus, whereas if they project to more widespread regions they are likely to influence movements involving multiple joints. In this context, we have examined the ramifications and terminations of single anterogradely labelled axons in the cerebellothalamic pathway of the rat. A total of nine axons were traced (by using a 100x oil objective) through serial sections from the caudal end of the thalamus to their terminations in the motor thalamus. Each of these axons gave off one or more collaterals which terminated in the intralaminar or other associated groups of thalamic nuclei, implying simultaneous activation of two functionally separate cerebellothalamic pathways. In the relay nucleus or motor thalamus, four axons formed either a single focal group of terminals or multiple groupings of terminals within a localised region, and five terminated over widespread regions including one which terminated bilaterally. These results show that a large proportion of cerebellar output neurones may be in a position to influence multi-joint or even bimanual movements.

The mismatch response, or mismatch negativity (MMN), is a neurophysiologic response to stimulus change. In humans and other animals, the MMN may underlie the ability to discriminate acoustic differences, a fundamental aspect of auditory perception. 2. This study investigated the role of the thalamus in the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in guinea pigs. Electrodes were placed in the caudomedial (nonprimary) and ventral (primary) subdivisions of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus). Surface epidural electrodes were placed at the midline and over the temporal lobe. The MMN was elicited by a deviant stimulus (2,450-Hz tone burst) embedded in a sequence of standard stimuli (2,300-Hz tone bursts). 3. A tone-evoked MMN was present in nonprimary thalamus but was absent in the primary thalamus. Surface-recorded MMNs were measured at the midline but not over the temporal lobe. The correspondence between nonprimary thalamic responses and midline surface potentials, and between primary thalamic responses and temporal surface potentials, is consistent with data reported for the auditory middle latency responses in guinea pigs. 4. The results demonstrate that the nonprimary auditory thalamus contributes to the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in the guinea pig. Furthermore, the data indicate that the guinea pig is a feasible model for investigating central auditory processes underlying acoustic discrimination.;"NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT NEUROBIOL & PHYSIOL,EVANSTON,IL 60208; NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT OTOLARYNGOL,EVANSTON,IL 60208";"Northwestern University; Northwestern University";KRAUS, N (corresponding author), NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT COMMUN SCI & DISORDERS,EVOKED POTENTIALS LAB,2299 N CAMPUS DR,EVANSTON,IL 60208, USA.;;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [R01 DC-00264] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;87;150;151;0;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We used a roving microelectrode to record vagal- evoked potentials in the thalamus of the macaque monkey. In addition to the anticipated activation in the gustatory/ visceral thalamic relay nucleus, we found an unexpectedly larger and earlier response focus with multi- unit discharges in the adjacent parafascicular nucleus. These data reveal a potent vagal input to this intralaminar nucleus, which is normally considered to be involved in motor control. This finding indicates that a role for this vagal activation site in the anti- epileptic effects of VNS needs to be considered.;"Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA; Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Izumo, Shimane, Japan";"Barrow Neurological Institute; Shimane University";Craig, AD (corresponding author), Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, 350 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.;bcraig@chw.edu;anand, amit/A-7222-2009;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-40413] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;50;29;35;0;7;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and neighboring regions of IT cortex. Here, we used fMRI to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in four monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene versus face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.;"[Arcaro, Michael J.; Livingstone, Margaret S.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Arcaro, XJ (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, 220 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;michael_arcaro@hms.harvard.edu;Arcaro, Michael/H-8964-2019;"Arcaro, Michael/0000-0002-4612-9921; Livingstone, Margaret/0000-0002-1950-0123";"NIH [R01 EY 25670, P30 EY 12196, F32 EY 24187]; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Institutes of Health; William Randolph Hearst Fellowship; NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant [S10RR021110]";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); William Randolph Hearst Fellowship; NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This work was supported by NIH Grants R01 EY 25670, P30 EY 12196, and F32 EY 24187 and performed in part at the Athinoula A.

In 2 monkeys, injections were centered on the lateral VTA with some spread into the substantia nigra, while in one animal the injection targeted the medial VTA with partial spread into the ventro-medial thalamus. Double-labeling with antibodies against transduced fluorescent proteins (FPs) and tyrosine hydroxylase indicated that substantial portions of transduced midbrain neurons were dopaminergic. Interestingly, cortical terminals were found either homogeneously in molecular layer I, or more heterogeneously, sometimes forming patches, in the deeper laminae II-VI. In the animals with injections in lateral VTA, terminals were most dense in somatomotor cortex and the striatum. In contrast, when the medial VTA was transduced, dense terminals were found in dorsal prefrontal and temporal cortices, while projections to striatum were sparse. In all monkeys, orbitofrontal and occipito-parietal cortex received strong and weak innervation, respectively. Thus, the dopaminergic ventral midbrain sends heterogeneous projections throughout the brain.

The dopaminergic system is of particular interest due to its role in the development of cognitive function and mood as well as its suspected involvement in neuropsychiatric illness. Nonhuman primate animal models provide a valuable resource for relating neurochemical changes to behavior. To facilitate comparison within and between primate models, we report in vivo D2/D3 binding in a large cohort of adolescent rhesus monkeys. Methods: In this work, the in vivo D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability was measured in a cohort of 33 rhesus monkeys in the adolescent stage of development (3.2-5.3 years). Both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 binding were measured using [F-18]fallypride with a high resolution small animal PET scanner. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) was measured for all subjects and group comparisons of D2/D3 binding among the cohort were made based on age and sex. Because two sequential studies were acquired from a single [F-18]fallypride batch, the effect of competing (unlabeled) ligand mass was also investigated. Results: Among this cohort, the rank order of regional D2/D3 receptor binding did not vary from previous studies with adult rhesus monkeys, with: putamen>caudate>ventral striatum>amygdala similar to substantia nigra>medial dorsal thalamus>lateral temporal cortex similar to frontal cortex. The DVR coefficient of variation ranged from 14%-26%, with the greatest variance seen in the head of the caudate. There were significant sex differences in [F-18]fallypride kinetics in the pituitary gland, but this was not observed for regions within the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, no regions in the brain showed significant sex or age related differences in DVR within this small age range. Based on a wide range of injected fallypride mass across the cohort, significant competition effects could only be detected in the substantia nigra, thalamus, and frontal cortex, and were not evident above intersubject variability in all other regions. Conclusion: These data represent the first report of large cohort in vivo D2/D3 dopamine whole brain binding in the adolescent brain and will serve as a valuable comparison for understanding dopamine changes during this critical time of development and provide a framework for creating a dopaminergic biochemical atlas for the rhesus monkey.

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.;"[Halgren, Milan; Eskandar, Emad; Cash, Sydney S.] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ulbert, Istvan; Wittner, Lucia] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan; Eross, Lorand] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Bion, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary; [Bastuji, Helene] Univ Claude Bernard, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France; [Bastuji, Helene] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Neurol, Serv Neurol Fonct & Epileptol, Unite Hypnol, F-69003 Lyon, France; [Fabo, Daniel] Natl Inst Clin Neurosci, Epilepsy Ctr, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary; [Eross, Lorand] Natl Inst Clin Neurosci, Dept Funct Neurosurg, H-1145 Budapest, Hungary; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] Aix Marseille Univ, Div is Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13007 Marseille, France; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] INSERM, Inst Neurosci Syst, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Rey, Marc; Chauvel, Patrick] Timone Hosp, AP HP, F-13005 Marseille, France; [Devinsky, Orrin; Doyle, Werner K.] NYU, Sch Med, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Mak-McCully, Rachel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Halgren, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Neurosci & Radiol, La Jolla, CA 93093 USA; [Heit, Gary] Permanente Med Grp Inc, Dept Neurosurg, Redwood City, CA 94063 USA; [Mandell, Arnold] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Halgren, Milan] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Eskandar, Emad] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Bronx, NY 10461 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Jean Monnet; CHU Lyon; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Hotel-Dieu - APHP; New York University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Permanente Medical Groups; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine";Halgren, M (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;mhalgren@mit.edu;"Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010; Fabo, Daniel/AAM-3226-2020; Wittner, Lucia/C-9386-2013";"Fabo, Daniel/0000-0001-5141-5351; BASTUJI, Helene/0000-0002-6690-2707; Eross, Lorand/0000-0002-5796-5546; Wittner, Lucia/0000-0001-6800-0953; Devinsky, Orrin/0000-0003-0044-4632; Halgren, Mila/0000-0003-2871-741X";"US Office of Naval Research [N00014-13-1-0672]; NIH [R01-MH-099645, R01-EB-009282, R01-NS-062092, K24-NS-088568]; Massachusetts General Hospital Executive Council on Research; Hungarian National Brain Research Program [KTIA_13_NAP-A-IV/1-4,6, 2017-1.2.1-NKP-2017-00002]; European Union Grant FP7 NeuroSeeker [600925]; Hungarian Government [OTKA PD101754, OTKA K119443]";"US Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Massachusetts General Hospital Executive Council on Research; Hungarian National Brain Research Program; European Union Grant FP7 NeuroSeeker; Hungarian Government";"We thank Erica Johnson, Nathan Meng, Richard Fiath, Qianli Xu, and Adam Niese for insightful comments, hypotheses, and technical support; and Project Tycho for making their macaque dataset publicly available.

Furthermore, clinical interventions aimed at interrupting ascending DC axons near the midline were successful in relieving the pain suffered by patients with cancer of the pelvic organs. The purpose of this study was to check whether a DC lesion in monkeys would reduce the responses of thalamic neurons to graded colorectal distension (CRD) as in rats. Experiments were done on anesthetized male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Extracellular single cell recordings were made in the ventrolateral complex of the thalamus, mainly the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus, in response to visceral and cutaneous stimulation. Of 80 VPL cells isolated, CRD activated 25, inhibited 25, and had no effect on 30 neurons. The responses of six viscerosensitive VPL neurons were recorded before and after a lesion of the DC at or above the T10 spinal segment. Lesions of other spinal tracts were made after the DC lesion. The results show that the DC lesion significantly reduced the responses of the thalamic neurons tested with CRD by >50%. Lesions of other tracts did not have a consistent effect. These results corroborate findings in the rat and support the proposal that the DC plays an important role in transmitting nociceptive visceral input into the thalamus and subsequently in visceral pain.;"Univ Texas, Med Branch, Inst Marine Biomed, Dept Internal Med, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Inst Marine Biomed, Div Gastroenterol, Galveston, TX 77555 USA; Univ Texas, Med Branch, Inst Marine Biomed, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Galveston, TX 77555 USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston";Willis, WD (corresponding author), Inst Marine Biol, Dept Anat & Neurosci, 301 Univ Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-09743, NS-11255] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;44;90;92;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The tremor-frequency activity of some cells is significantly correlated with tremor. Cells in this region also display functional properties defined by activity related to somatosensory stimuli and to active movement. Cells with activity related to somatosensory stimulation were termed sensory cells while those with activity related to active movement were termed voluntary cells. Cells with activity related to both somatosensory stimulation and active movement were termed combined cells. Those with activity related to neither somatosensory stimulation nor active movement were termed no-response cells. Combined, voluntary and no-response cells were located in the region of thalamus where a lesion stops tremor and anterior to the region where sensory cells were found. Spectral cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that many combined, voluntary and no-response cells had a peak of activity at tremor frequency which was significantly correlated with electromyogram (EMG). Analysis of the phase of thalamic activity relative to EMG activity indicated that voluntary and combined cell activity usually led EMG during tremor. These results suggest that thalamic cells unresponsive to somatosensory stimulation (voluntary and no-response cells) and those responsive to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells) are involved in the mechanism of parkinsonian tremor. The activity of sensory cells frequently lagged behind tremor while activity of combined cells often led tremor. This finding suggests that the activity of these two cell types, both responding to sensory input, is related to tremor by different mechanisms.;"UNIV TORONTO, DEPT PHYSIOL, TORONTO, ON, CANADA; UNIV TORONTO, DEPT SURG, TORONTO, ON, CANADA";"University of Toronto; University of Toronto";LENZ, FA (corresponding author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV HOSP, DEPT NEUROSURG, MEYER 7-113, 600 N WOLFE ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21287 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [K08-NS1384, NS28598] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;109;259;260;0;8;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;JUN;1994;117;;3;;;;531;543;;10.1093/brain/117.3.531;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/117.3.531;;;13;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;PA574;8032863;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994PA57400010;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this regard, all coordinates have been referenced to a line linking the anterior and posterior commissures (ac-pc line) and considering the center of the ac at the midline as the origin of the bicommissural space. The atlas comprises of 43 different plates (19 coronal levels, 10 sagittal levels and 14 horizontal levels). In addition to 'classical' cyto- and chemoarchitectural techniques such as the Nissl method and the acetylcholinesterase stain, several immunohistochemical stains have been performed in adjacent sections, including the detection of tyrosine hydroxylase, enkephalin, neurofilaments, parvalbumin and calbindin. In comparison to other existing stereotaxic atlases for M. fasicularis, this atlas has two main advantages: firstly, brain cartography is based on a wide variety of cyto- and chemoarchitectural stains carried out on adjacent sections, therefore enabling accurate segmentation. Secondly and most importantly, sagittal and horizontal planes are included. Sagittal planes are very useful for calculating oblique trajectories, whereas, clinical researchers engaged in neuroimaging studies will be more familiar with horizontal sections, as they use horizontal (also called axial) brain images in their daily routine of their clinical practices.;"[Lanciego, Jose L.] Univ Navarra, Area Neurociencias, CIMA, Fac Med, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Lanciego, Jose L.] Univ Navarra, Fac Med, Ctr Invest Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat CIBERN, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Vazquez, Alfonso] Complejo Hosp Navarra, Serv Neurocirugia, Pamplona, Spain";"University of Navarra; University of Navarra; Servicio Navarro de Salud - Osasunbidea";Lanciego, JL (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Area Neurociencias, CIMA, Fac Med, Pio XII Ave 55, Pamplona 31008, Spain.;jlanciego@unav.es;Lanciego, Jose L./G-7759-2015;Lanciego, Jose L./0000-0003-2301-5419;"Spanish Government (Ministerios de Salud y de Ciencia e Innovacion) [FIS 01/0237, BFI2003-02033, BFU2006-06744, BFU2009-08351, SAF2008-03118-E]; CiberNed [CB06/05/0006]; Government of Navarra (Departamento de Salud); UTE, Foundation for Applied Medical Research";"Spanish Government (Ministerios de Salud y de Ciencia e Innovacion); CiberNed(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); Government of Navarra (Departamento de Salud); UTE, Foundation for Applied Medical Research";"Expert technical assistance was received at all times from our technicians Ms. Elvira Roda and Ms. Ainhoa Moreno.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we developed and characterized a macaque model of CPSP. The location of the VPL was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation, after which a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Immunohistochemistry revealed that microglial and astrocytic activation in the perilesional areas lasted at least 3 months after injection. The present model reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Further, the long- lasting glial activation revealed here may be characteristic of primate brains following injury. The present model will be useful not only for examining the neurological changes underlying CPSP, but also for testing therapeutic interventions for CPSP.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tsukuba";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016; Matsuda, Keiji/N-2784-2016; Higo, Noriyuki/M-6385-2016";"Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Matsuda, Keiji/0000-0003-2529-0019; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316; Higo, Noriyuki/0000-0002-3448-1696";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [25351004, 16K01489]; MEXT of Japan [17H05917]; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); PRESTO of Japanese Science and Technology Agency;  [17J03104]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25351004, 17H05917, 16K01489, 17J03104] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)); PRESTO of Japanese Science and Technology Agency; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";We are grateful to Mr. T.

However, it is becoming clear that given the same stress, some individuals are very vulnerable and will succumb to illness while others are more resilient and cope effectively, rather than becoming ill. This difference between individuals is called stress sensitivity. Stress sensitivity of an individual appears to be influenced by genetically inherited factors, early life (even prenatal) stress, and by the presence or absence of factors that provide protection from stress. In comparison to other stress-related diseases, the concept of sensitivity versus resilience to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction has received relatively little attention. The studies presented herein were undertaken to begin to identify stable characteristics and the neural underpinnings of individuals with sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction. Female cynomolgus macaques with normal menstrual cycles either stop ovulating (stress sensitive) or to continue to ovulate (stress resilient) upon exposure to a combined metabolic and psychosocial stress. However, even in the absence of stress, the stress-sensitive animals have lower secretion of the ovarian steroids, estrogen and progesterone, have higher heart rates, have lower serotonin function, have fewer serotonin neurons and lower expression of pivotal serotonin-related genes, have lower expression of 5HT2A and 2C genes in the hypothalamus, have higher gene expression of GAD67 and CRH in the hypothalamus, and have reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone transport to the anterior pituitary. Altogether, the results suggest that the neurobiology of reproductive circuits in stress-sensitive individuals is compromised.

Peak levels of radioactivity were measured in brain at 90 min after injection of the tracer. Accumulation of radioactivity was highest in the thalamus, intermediate in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, and lowest in the cerebellum. The ratio of specific to nonspecific binding (V-3) in the thalamus, estimated from the (thalamic - cerebellar)/cerebellar radioactivity ratio, reached a value of 6 at 4 h post-injection. Specific binding was reduced by subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg cytisine at 2.25 h after injection of radiotracer. At 2.5 h after cytisine administration, radioactivity in the thalamus was reduced by 84 %, in the frontal cortex, by 76%, and in the basal ganglia, by 57 % of the level measured at the time of cytisine administration, demonstrating that the binding was reversible. On the basis of these findings, together with other data indicating high affinity, receptor subtype selectivity, low nonspecific binding and lack of toxicity in animals, 5-[I-123]iodo-A-85380 appears to be a promising ligand for SPECT imaging of nAChRs in the human brain.

Many of these maps are arranged in a discontinuous or patchy manner. Similarly, thalamocortical projections arising from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body to the primary auditory cortex are also patchy. We used anterograde labeling and electrophysiological methods to examine the relationship between thalamocortical patches and auditory cortical maps. Biotinylated dextran-amine was deposited into physiologically characterized sites in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of New Zealand white rabbits. Approximately 7 d later, the animal was again anesthetized and the ipsilateral auditory cortex was mapped with tungsten microelectrodes. Multi-unit physiological data were obtained for the following characteristics: best frequency (BF), binaurality, response type, latency, sharpness of tuning, and threshold. Immunocytochemical methods were used to reveal the injection site in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body as well as the anterogradely labeled thalamocortical afferents in the auditory cortex. In 86% of the cases (12 of 14), entry into a thalamocortical patch was associated with a marked change in physiological responses. A consistent BF and binaural class were usually observed within a patch. The patches appear to innervate distinct functional regions coding frequency and binaurality. A model is presented showing how patchy thalamocortical projections participate in the formation of tonotopic and binaural maps in primary auditory cortex.;"Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA";"University of Arizona; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe";Velenovsky, DS (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Cell Biol & Anat, POB 245044, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;dsv@u.arizona.edu;;Sinex, Donal/0000-0002-0673-7252;"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC05108, F32 DC005108, DC02410] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS07434] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;68;48;49;0;3;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

One of the questions raised by the concept of parallelism is whether and how the different circuits interact. The present Commentary proposes that interaction is inherent in the neural architecture of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. This proposal is based on the re-examination of the data on the topographical organization of the frontocortical-basal ganglia connections which indicates that each circuit-engaged striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of both substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (each ventral striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus), and this segregation is maintained at subsequent thalamic and frontocortical levels. This results in an asymmetry in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia relationships, so that while each frontocortical subfield innervates one striatal region, each striatal region influences the basal ganglia output to two frontocortical subfields. Because of this asymmetry, at least one of the frontocortical targets of a given circuit-engaged striatal region is not the source of its frontocortical input. Since this organization is inconsistent with an arrangement in closed segregated circuits we introduce the concept of a ''split circuit''. A split circuit emanates from one frontocortical area, but terminates in two frontocortical areas. Thus, a split circuit contains at least one ''open'' striato-fronto-cortical pathway, that leads from a circuit-engaged striatal region to a frontocortical area which is a source of a different circuit. In this manner split circuits are interconnected via their open pathways. The second striato-fronto-cortical pathway of a split circuit can be another open pathway, or it can re-enter the frontocortical area of origin, forming a closed circuit. On the basis of the available anatomical data we tentatively identified a motor, an associative, and a limbic split circuit, each containing a closed circuit and an open pathway. The motor split circuit contains a closed motor circuit that re-enters the motor and premotor cortical areas and an open motor pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex. The associative split circuit contains a closed associative circuit that re-enters the associative prefrontal cortex and an open associative pathway that terminates in the premotor cortex. The limbic split circuit contains a closed limbic circuit that re-enters the limbic prefrontal cortex, an open limbic pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex, and possibly an additional open limbic pathway terminating in the motor/premotor cortices. Possible functional implications of this open interconnected organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are discussed.;TEL AVIV UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, IL-69978 TEL AVIV, ISRAEL;Tel Aviv University;;;Weiner, Irving D/G-6333-2016;"Weiner, Irving D/0000-0002-0046-0600; Joel, Daphna/0000-0002-2003-4190";;;;;150;309;312;1;9;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;NOV;1994;63;2;;;;;363;379;;10.1016/0306-4522(94)90536-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(94)90536-3;;;17;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;PV683;7891852;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994PV68300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.;SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;;;;;;;;40;154;158;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN-FEB;2000;17;1;;;;;55;62;;10.1017/S0952523800171056;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800171056;;;8;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";294TT;10750826;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000085927000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus in combination with a conventional tracer, we studied direct and polysynaptic inputs to the ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) and medial intraparietal area (MIP) in non-human primates, to identify possible sources of eye position and gaze signals. We found that these areas receive disynaptic inputs from the brainstem horizontal eye position integrator network (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, PH) via the central lateral and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei. Our findings provide the first demonstration that inputs from the horizontal eye position integrator reach cortical areas. We found important topographical differences between PH populations targeting MIP and LIPv that likely reflect transmission of different types of eye movement signals. LIPv receives projections from the ipsilateral rostral PH, which may transmit ipsilateral eye position signals. In addition to inputs from the rostral PH, MIP receives strong projections from the contralateral caudal PH, which may contribute to both eye position and velocity signals. Unlike the horizontal integrator, we found that the vertical eye position integrator network, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, does not project to these posterior parietal areas, in keeping with findings that the thalamic nuclei targeting LIPv and MIP receive almost exclusively horizontal oculomotor signals.;"[Prevosto, Vincent; Ugolini, Gabriella] CNRS, Neurobiol Cellulaire & Mol Lab, UPR9040, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Graf, Werner] Howard Univ, Coll Med, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Washington, DC 20059 USA";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Howard University";Ugolini, G (corresponding author), CNRS, Neurobiol Cellulaire & Mol Lab, UPR9040, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.;gabriella.ugolini@nbcm.cnrs-gif.fr;;Prevosto, Vincent/0000-0001-8803-5918;"European Union [QLRT-2001-00151]; french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres";"European Union(European Union (EU)); french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres";This work was supported by the European Union grant EU 5th FP (QLRT-2001-00151, EUROKINESIS) and the Lavoisier Fellowship from the french Ministere des Affaires etrangeres (V.P.).

Although this leads to a rapid succession of discontinuous and fragmented retinal snapshots, we perceive the world as stable and coherent. Neural mechanisms underlying visual stability may depend on internal monitoring of planned or ongoing eye movements. In the macaque brain, a pathway for the transmission of such signals has been identified that is relayed by central thalamic nuclei. Here, we studied a possible role of this pathway for perceptual stability in a patient with a selective lesion affecting homologous regions of the human thalamus. Compared with controls, the patient exhibited a unilateral deficit in monitoring his eye movements. This deficit was manifest by a systematic inaccuracy both in successive eye movements and in judging the locations of visual stimuli. In addition, perceptual consequences of oculomotor targeting errors were erroneously attributed to external stimulus changes. These findings show that the human brain draws on transthalamic monitoring signals to bridge the perceptual discontinuities generated by our eye movements.;"[Ostendorf, Florian; Liebermann, Daniela; Ploner, Christoph J.] Charite, Dept Neurol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Liebermann, Daniela] Charite, Ctr Stroke Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany";"Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Ostendorf, F (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Neurol, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;florian.ostendorf@charite.de;"Ostendorf, Florian/AAE-1348-2019; Ostendorf, Florian/E-8342-2013";"Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ostendorf, Florian/0000-0002-4544-7610; Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530";German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GW0653];German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF));We are very grateful to N.P.

Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Kruger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements ( black) better and faster than increments ( white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey's primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).";"[Yeh, Chun-I; Xing, Dajun; Shapley, Robert M.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA";New York University;Yeh, CI (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;ciy@cns.nyu.edu;Xing, Dajun/F-4217-2011;YEH, CHUN-I/0000-0002-2375-0723;"U.

Individual areas are distinguished on the basis of unique profiles comprising architectonic features, thalamic and cortical connections, and neuron response properties. Recent demonstrations of convergent auditory-somatosensory interactions in the caudomedial (CM) and caudolateral (CL) belt areas prompted us to pursue anatomical studies to identify the source(s) of somatic input to auditory cortex. Corticocortical and thalamocortical connections were revealed by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into CM, CL, and adjoining fields of marmoset (Callithrix jacchus jacchus) and macaque (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. In addition to auditory cortex, the cortical connections of CM and CL included somatosensory (retroinsular, Ri; granular insula, Ig) and multisensory areas (temporal parietal occipital, temporal parietal temporal). Thalamic inputs included the medial geniculate complex and several multisensory nuclei (supra-geniculate, posterior, limitans, medial pulvinar), but not the ventroposterior complex. Injections of the core (Al, R) and rostromedial areas of auditory cortex revealed sparse multisensory connections. The results suggest that areas Ri and Ig are the principle sources of somatosensory input to the caudal belt, while multisensory regions of cortex and thalamus may also contribute. The present data add to growing evidence of multisensory convergence in cortical areas previously considered to be 'unimodal', and also indicate that auditory cortical areas differ in this respect.";"[Hackett, Troy A.; de la Mothe, Lisa A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Smiley, John F.; Lakatos, Peter; Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Ulbert, Istvan; Karmos, George; Lakatos, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, H-1394 Budapest, Hungary; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Columbia University";Hackett, TA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;troy.a.hackett@vanderbilt.edu;Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010;Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021;;;;;96;73;73;0;5;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0301-0066;1468-4233;;PERCEPTION;Perception;;2007;36;10;;;;;1419;1430;;10.1068/p5841;http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p5841;;;12;"Ophthalmology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)";"Ophthalmology; Psychology";254LN;18265825;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000252588200002;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is therefore surprising that this ability is impaired by medial temporal lobe (MTL) resections, because such lesions spare working memory in other sensory modalities. To determine whether MTL ablations might have caused the auditory deficit through inadvertent transection of superior temporal gyrus (STG) projections to its downstream targets, and, if so, which targets might have been compromised, we injected anterograde tracer (biotinylated dextran amine) in the STG of both the normal and MTL-lesioned hemispheres of split-brain monkeys. Interhemispheric comparison of label failed to show any effect of the MTL ablation on efferents from caudal STG, which projects to the inferior prefrontal convexity. However, the ablation did consistently interrupt the normally dense projections from rostral STG to both the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and medial thalamic nuclei. The findings support the possibility that the auditory working memory deficit after MTL ablation is due to transection of downstream auditory projections, and indicate that the candidate structures for mediating auditory working memory are the ventral medial prefrontal cortical areas, the medial thalamus, or both.;"[Munoz, Monica; Mishkin, Mortimer; Saunders, Richard C.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Munoz, M (corresponding author), Inst Child Hlth, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England.;monica.munoz@ich.ucl.ac.uk;"Munoz, Monica/C-9189-2009; Munoz-Lopez, Monica/F-3154-2016";Munoz-Lopez, Monica/0000-0002-5530-2394;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));Funding for this article and for the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.;;55;19;19;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Here we test the functional and anatomical validity of this proposal by comparing data from diffusion tractography, cytoarchitecture and functional imaging. We acquired diffusion imaging data in eleven healthy subjects and performed probabilistic tractography from voxels within the thalamus. Cortical connectivity information was used to divide the thalamus into sub-regions with highest probability of connectivity to distinct cortical areas. The relative volumes of these connectivity-defined sub-regions correlate well with volumetric predictions based on a histological atlas. Previously reported centres of functional activation within the thalamus during motor or executive tasks co-localize within atlas regions showing high probabilities of connection to motor or prefrontal cortices, respectively. This work provides a powerful validation of quantitative grey matter segmentation using diffusion tractography in humans. Co-registering thalamic sub-regions from 11 healthy individuals characterizes inter-individual variation in segmentation and results in a population-based atlas of the human thalamus that can be used to assign likely anatomical labels to thalamic locations in standard brain space.

Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem, These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.;"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;s.sherman@sunysb.edu;;;;;;;97;583;594;2;46;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;1471-2970;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

To further understand chemokine receptors in the brain and explore their potential role in HIV neuropathogenesis, particularly in pediatrics, we examined the regional and cellular distribution of CCR5 and CXCR4 in normal fetal, neonatal, and adult rhesus macaques. CCR5 and CXCR4 were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence within the cytoplasm of subpopulations of neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum and by flow cytometry on the surface of neurons and glia. Interestingly, expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 increased significantly (p<0.05) from birth to 9 months of age.

The brain of a macaque was used as a reference for the cytoarchitectonic study of the complex. Three parts were isolated: the pars parafascicularis (or medial part), the pars media (or middle part) and the pars paralateralis (or lateral part). Wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was stereotaxically injected into either the sensorimotor or the associative territory of the striatum (i.e. the striatal space occupied by the axonal endings coming from either the sensorimotor or the associative cortex) of four macaques. Neurons projecting to the sensorimotor territory of the striatum were found to be located within the pars media (middle part) of the central complex while neurons projecting to the associative territory of the striatum were located within the pars parafascicularis. In all experimental cases, labelled neurons were scarce or absent in the pars paralateralis (or lateral part). Outside the central complex, neurons projecting to the sensorimotor territory of the striatum were scattered within the lateral part of the lateral mass, in the intralaminar nuclei and in the posterior part of the internal lamina. Neurons projecting to the associative territory of the striatum were observed mainly in the paraventricular region, dorsal to the rostral part of the lateral mass, and in the dorsolateral part of the nucleus oralis medialis. Our three-dimensional analysis of the clusters of the central complex cells projecting to the two striatal territories justifies the partitioning of the central complex into three parts. The pars media (or middle part), which projects to the sensorimotor territory of the striatum, receives selectively pallidal afferent axons. It belongs to the Nauta-Mehler loop, a closed loop linking the central complex to the basal ganglia. The pars parafascicularis, which projects to the associative territory of the striatum, seems more related to oculomotor neuronal systems.

However, few studies have investigated the neural sites where multisensory integration may occur. Therefore, we used electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to study a region of the rat parietotemporal cortex that responds uniquely to auditory and somatosensory multisensory stimulation. This multisensory responsiveness suggests a functional organization resembling multisensory association cortex in cats and primates. Extracellular multielectrode surface mapping defined a region between auditory and somatosensory cortex where responses to combined auditory/somatosensory stimulation were larger in amplitude and earlier in latency than responses to either stimulus alone. Moreover, multisensory responses were nonlinear and differed from the summed unimodal responses. Intracellular recording found almost exclusively multisensory cells that responded to both unisensory and multisensory stimulation with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and/or action potentials, conclusively defining a multisensory zone (MZ). In addition, intracellular responses were similar to extracellular recordings, with larger and earlier EPSPs evoked by multisensory stimulation, and interactions suggesting nonlinear postsynaptic summation to combined stimuli. Thalamic input to MZ from unimodal auditory and somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei and from multisensory thalamic regions support the idea that parallel thalamocortical projections may drive multisensory functions as strongly as corticocortical projections. Whereas the MZ integrates uni- and multisensory thalamocortical afferent streams, it may ultimately influence brainstem multisensory structures such as the superior colliculus. J. Comp.

By showing that responses in visual thalamus are modulated by perceptual and cognitive tasks, recent fMRI and physiology studies have helped revise this view. The modulatory input to the visual thalamus derives from functionally distinct cortical and subcortical feedback pathways. These pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements. Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity. These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.;"[Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University";Kastner, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.;skastner@princeton.edu;Saalmann, Yuri B/AAW-5814-2021;"Kastner, Sabine/0000-0002-9742-965X; Saalmann, Yuri/0000-0001-8880-6698";"NEI [RO1 EY017699]; NIMH [RO1 MH64043]";"NEI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";We thank Marius Peelen and Ryan Mruczek for comments on the manuscript.

V2 contains three sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions) and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well; terminal label in layers 3-4 was distributed in discrete patches with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and targeted both ''thick'' (Cat-301(+)) and ''thin'' GO-rich stripes, avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers 5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer 6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent thalamic input shared by the ''thick'' and ''thin'' CO stripes (which receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests another potential source of integration between the two cortical visual streams.";JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV,KRIEGER MIND BRAIN INST,BALTIMORE,MD 21218;Johns Hopkins University;LEVITT, JB (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON,INST OPHTHALMOL,DEPT VISUAL SCI,11-43 BATH ST,LONDON WC1V 9EL,ENGLAND.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY05282, EY08098, EY10021] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;43;58;58;0;2;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

After rabies injections into area 46, many neurons in the restricted region of the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of PIN neurons labeled from the M1.

Anterograde labeling of terminals was done with 2% WGA-HRP injections in the cervical enlargement; thalamocortical cells were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent tracers. In one experiment, the contralateral;primary somatosensory cortex hand region (hSI) was injected to provide a direct comparison with hSII thalamic label. Both labeled cells and terminal-like structures were visualized in single thalamic sections and their numbers and positions quantitatively analyzed. The number of labeled cells within 100 microns from the STT terminals were counted as overlapping cells. Four thalamic nuclei, ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior lateral (VPI), posterior nucleus (PO) and centrolateral nucleus (CL) combined to contain 86.5% of all hSII-projecting overlapping cells. Of all hSII-projecting thalamic overlapping cells, VPI contained the largest number (36.4% of the total)followed by the anterior portion of the posterior nuclear complex (POa; 20.4%), VPL (18.3%) and CL (11.4%). Results of the hSI injection show a different pattern of overlap in agreement with our earlier study. The relative distribution of overlapping cells was dependent on the antero-posterior position of the SII injections. The most anterior injections resulted in small numbers of labeled cells, with the majority of overlapping cells located in PO and CL. The more posterior injections resulted in overlapping cells mainly in VPI and VPL.

Orbital and medial prefrontal cortices receive input from cortical and subcortical structures associated with emotions. Thus, the prefrontal cortex may be an essential link for autonomic responses driven by emotions. Classic studies have demonstrated the existence of projections between prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus, a central autonomic structure, but the topographic organization of these connections in the monkey has not been clearly established. We investigated the organization of bidirectional connections between these areas in the rhesus monkey by using tracer injections in orbital, medial, and lateral prefrontal areas. All prefrontal areas investigated received projections from the hypothalamus, originating mainly in the posterior hypothalamus. Differences in the topography of hypothalamic projection neurons were related to both the location and type of the target cortical area. Injections in lateral eulaminate prefrontal areas primarily labeled neurons in the posterior hypothalamus that were equally distributed in the lateral and medial hypothalamus. In contrast, injections in orbitofrontal and medial limbic cortices labeled neurons in the anterior and tuberal regions of the hypothalamus and in the posterior region. Projection neurons targeting orbital limbic cortices were more prevalent in the lateral part of the hypothalamus, whereas those targeting medial limbic cortices were more prevalent in the medial hypothalamus. In comparison to the ascending projections, descending projections from prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus were highly specific, originating mostly from orbital and medial prefrontal cortices. The ascending and descending connections overlapped in the hypothalamus in areas that have autonomic functions. These results suggest that specific orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal areas exert a direct influence on the hypothalamus and may be important for the autonomic responses evoked by complex emotional situations.

In addition to the relatively well described age-associated pathologies that reduce sensory processing at the level of the cochlea and eye, multiple changes occur along the ascending auditory and visual pathways that further reduce sensory function in each domain. One fundamental question that remains to be directly addressed is whether the structure and function of the central auditory and visual systems follow similar trajectories across the lifespan or sustain the impacts of brain aging independently. The present study used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological assessments of auditory and visual system function in adult and aged macaques to better understand how age-related changes in white matter connectivity at multiple levels of each sensory system might impact auditory and visual function. In particular, the fractional anisotropy (FA) of auditory and visual system thalamocortical and interhemispheric corticocortical connections was estimated using probabilistic tractography analyses. Sensory processing and sensory system FA were both reduced in older animals compared with younger adults. Corticocortical FA was significantly reduced only in white matter of the auditory system of aged monkeys, while thalamocortical FA was lower only in visual system white matter of the same animals. Importantly, these structural alterations were significantly associated with sensory function within each domain. Together, these results indicate that age-associated deficits in auditory and visual processing emerge in part from microstructural alterations to specific sensory white matter tracts, and not from general differences in white matter condition across the aging brain.;"[Gray, Daniel T.; De La Pena, Nicole M.; Engle, James R.; Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Gray, Daniel T.; De La Pena, Nicole M.; Engle, James R.; Trouard, Theodore P.; Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Umapathy, Lavanya] Univ Arizona, Elect & Comp Engn, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Burke, Sara N.] Univ Florida, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Gainesville, FL 32609 USA; [Trouard, Theodore P.] Univ Arizona, Dept Biomed Engn, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Barnes, Carol A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA";"University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona";"Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.;Barnes, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.";carol@nsma.arizona.edu;", Lavanya/AAO-3619-2021; Burke, Sara N/I-5691-2019";", Lavanya/0000-0002-7224-0930; Burke, Sara N/0000-0002-1773-1294; De La Pena, Nicole/0000-0002-1302-6299";"National Institutes of Health [RO1-AG-050548, F31-AG-055263]; McKnight Brain Research Foundation; Arizona Department of Health Services";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); McKnight Brain Research Foundation; Arizona Department of Health Services";"This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants RO1-AG-050548 and F31-AG-055263, the McKnight Brain Research Foundation, and the Arizona Department of Health Services.

In neurodegenerative disorders termed tauopathies, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular inclusions. Rhesus macaques are widely used for studying ageing processes and modeling neurodegenerative disorders, yet little is known about endogenous tau expression in their brains. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to map and characterize total tau, 3R- and 4R-tau isoforms, and phosphorylated tau (pThr231-tau and pSer202/Thr205-tau/AT8) expression bilaterally in 16 brain regions of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian adult rhesus macaques. Tau-immunoreactivity (-ir), including both 3R and 4R isoforms, was observed throughout the brain, with varying regional intensities. The anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus displayed the most robust tau-ir, while the subthalamic nucleus and white matter regions had minimal expression. Tau was present in neurons of gray matter regions; it was preferentially observed in fibers of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and in cell bodies of the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. In white matter regions, tau was abundantly present in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, neuronal pThr231-tau-ir was abundant in all brain regions, but not AT8-ir. Differences in regional and intracellular protein expression were not detected between control subjects and both brain hemispheres of MPTP-treated animals. Specifically, tau-ir in the substantia nigra of all subjects colocalized with GABAergic neurons. Overall, this report provides an in-depth characterization of tau expression in the rhesus macaque brain to facilitate future investigations for understanding and modeling tau pathology in this species.";"[Gambardella, Julia C.

The model clarifies how bottom-up and top-down processes work together to realize this goal, notably how processes of learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony are coordinated. The model hereby clarifies, for the first time, how the following levels of brain organization coexist to realize cognitive processing properties that regulate fast learning and stable memory of brain representations: single-cell properties, such as spiking dynamics, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and acetylcholine modulation; detailed laminar thalamic and cortical circuit designs and their interactions; aggregate cell recordings, such as current source densities and local field potentials; and single-cell and large-scale inter-areal oscillations in the gamma and beta frequency domains. In particular, the model predicts how laminar circuits of multiple cortical areas interact with primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific thalamic nuclei to carry out attentive visual learning and information processing. The model simulates how synchronization of neuronal spiking occurs within and across brain regions, and triggers STDP. Matches between bottom-up adaptively filtered input patterns and learned top-down expectations cause gamma oscillations that support attention, resonance, learning, and consciousness. Mismatches inhibit learning while causing beta oscillations during reset and hypothesis testing operations that are initiated in the deeper cortical layers. The generality of learned recognition codes is controlled by a vigilance process mediated by acetylcholine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Because the TRN receives bottom-up sensory input and top-down cortical input, it could serve as an integration hub for sensory and cognitive signals. Functional evidence supports broad roles for the TRN in arousal, attention, and sensory selection. How specific circuits connecting the TRN with sensory thalamic structures implement these functions is not known. The structural organization and function of the TRN is particularly interesting in the context of highly organized sensory systems, such as the primate visual system, where neurons in the retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN) are morphologically and physiologically distinct and also specialized for processing particular features of the visual environment. To gain insight into the functional relationship between the visual sector of the TRN and the dLGN, we reconstructed a large number of TRN neurons that were retrogradely labeled following injections of rabies virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the dLGN. An independent cluster analysis, based on 10 morphological metrics measured for each reconstructed neuron, revealed three clusters of TRN neurons that differed in cell body shape and size, dendritic arborization patterns, and medial-lateral position within the TRN. TRN dendritic and axonal morphologies are inconsistent with visual stream-specific projections to the dLGN. Instead, TRN neuronal organization could facilitate transmission of global arousal and/or cognitive signals to the dLGN with retinotopic precision that preserves specialized processing of foveal versus peripheral visual information.

Only 5-10% of the inputs to geniculate relay cells derive from retina, which is the driving input. The rest, being modulatory, derive from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from visual cortex, and ascending inputs from brainstem. The nonretinal, modulatory inputs, which form the vast majority, dynamically control the nature of the geniculate relay. Among other actions, these modulatory inputs regulate membrane properties of relay cells and thereby control their mode of response to retinal inputs, and this dramatically affects the nature of information relayed to cortex. Our studies of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat lead to the speculation that this dynamic control depends on the animal's behavioral state and represents the neuronal substrate for many forms of visual attention. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to cortex for the first time. In contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar (and lateral posterior nucleus in carnivores), is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it seems to relay information from one cortical area to another. Much more corticocortical processing may involve these 're-entry' routes than has been hitherto appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for corticocortical processing.;SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook";Sherman, SM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Physiol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY11409, EY03038] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;61;37;37;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-50586-5;PROG BRAIN RES;;;2001;134;;;;;;51;69;;;;;;19;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";BV10B;11702563;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000177817400004;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined the possibility that the TRN is involved in covert orienting of attention. Attention can be summoned to a spatial location in the absence of an overt orienting response. The reaction time to a visual target is faster when attention has been drawn to the location of the target by a preceding cue in that location (valid cue) compared with when the cue misdirects attention (invalid cue) away from the location of the subsequent target. This reaction time difference is referred to as the validity effect. Rats were trained to perform such a reaction time task with visual cues and targets presented in poke holes to either side of the rat's head, which had to be maintained centrally and still. If the rat made an overt orienting response to the cue, the trial was aborted. Unilateral lesions were made by injection of ibotenic acid in the TRN. After surgery, there was no bias apparent in their responding; they were as likely to initiate responses and were equally accurate to either side. There was, however, a complete abolition of the validity effect for responses to contralateral targets.

Rehabilitation involving sensory retraining can improve perceptual function, presumably through plasticity mechanisms in the somatosensory processing network. However, virtually nothing is known about the effects of rehabilitation strategies on brain organization, or where the effects are mediated. In this study, five macaque monkeys received months of enriched sensory experience after median nerve cut and repair early in life. Subsequently, the sensory representation of the hand in primary somatosensory cortex was mapped using multiunit microelectrodes. Additionally, the primary somatosensory relay in the thalamus, the ventroposterior nucleus, was studied to determine whether the effects of the enrichment were initiated subcortically or cortically. Age-matched controls included six monkeys with no sensory manipulation after median nerve cut and regeneration, and one monkey that had restricted sensory experience after the injury. The most substantial effect of the sensory environment was on receptive field sizes in cortical area 3b. Significantly greater proportions of cortical receptive fields in the enriched monkeys were small and well localized compared to the controls, which showed higher proportions of abnormally large or disorganized fields. The refinements in receptive field size and extent in somatosensory cortex likely provide better resolution in the sensory map and may explain the improved functional outcomes after rehabilitation in humans.;Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37203 USA;Vanderbilt University;Florence, SL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 36469] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;61;29;30;0;1;BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Using these models, cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover, some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models, a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore, we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys, the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter, a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models, the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore, the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months, such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently, brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore, the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.;"[Higo, Noriyuki; Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST);Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.;;;;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN;TOKYO;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN, TOKYO, 00000, JAPAN;0915-8588;2187-4697;;PAIN RES;Pain Res.;;2018;33;4;;;;;275;281;;10.11154/pain.33.275;http://dx.doi.org/10.11154/pain.33.275;;;7;Clinical Neurology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Neurosciences & Neurology;VI8AT;;gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000514199800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The presence of four inferior subdivisions, comparable to those found in architectonic-connectional studies in squirrel monkeys (C.G. Cusick, J.L. Scripter, J.G. Darensbourg, and J.T. Weber, 1993, J. Comp. Neurol. 336:1-30), provided a basis for a proposed revised terminology for visual sectors of the macaque pulvinar. In the present study, the inferior pulvinar (PI) was identified as a neurochemically distinct region that included the traditional cytoarchitectonic nucleus PI and adjacent portions of the lateral and medial pulvinar nuclei, PL and PM. In calbindin-D-28k stains, the lateral subdivision of the inferior pulvinar (PIL) had less intense neuropil staining than the adjacent central division, PIC. The PIL was characterized by large, intensely immunopositive neurons seldom found within PIC. PIL occupied the traditional PL and PI and exhibited a narrow shell zone, PIL-S, restricted to FL. The medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PIM) was in a location previously shown to be strongly connected with the middle temporal visual area (MT) in macaques. PIM was found in the medial one-half of the traditional PI and extended into adjacent portions of the traditional PM and FL. PIM was distinguished by less intense neuropil staining for calbindin and many cells stained with the SMI-32 antibody for neurofilament protein. In AChE stains, PIL was moderately dark, PIC appeared lighter, and PIM was characterized by small, intensely stained patches. The small posterior division (PIp) stained darkly for calbindin, lightly for AChE, and was unstained with the SMI-32 antibody. Thus, neurochemical, and perhaps connectional, subdivisions exist within PI, the region of the pulvinar that relays information to striate, ''lower order'' extrastriate, and inferotemporal visual cortex.

Our study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the perceptual parsing and grouping of complex repeating auditory patterns that occur based solely on statistical regularities, or context. Human psychophysical studies suggest that the recognition of novel auditory patterns amid a continuous auditory stimulus sequence occurs automatically halfway through the first repetition. We hypothesized that once repeating patterns were detected by the brain, internal rhythms would become entrained, demarcating the temporal structure of these repetitions despite lacking external cues defining pattern on- or offsets. To examine the neural correlates of pattern perception, neuroelectric activity of primary auditory cortex (A1) and thalamic nuclei was recorded while nonhuman primates passively listened to streams of rapidly presented pure tones and bandpass noise bursts. At arbitrary intervals, random acoustic patterns composed of 11 stimuli were repeated five times without any perturbance of the constant stimulus flow. We found significant delta entrainment by these patterns in the A1, medial geniculate body, and medial pulvinar. In A1 and pulvinar, we observed a statistically significant, pattern structure-aligned modulation of neuronal firing that occurred earliest in the pulvinar, supporting the idea that grouping and detecting complex auditory patterns is a top-down, context-driven process. Besides electrophysiological measures, a pattern-related modulation of pupil diameter verified that, like humans, nonhuman primates consciously detect complex repetitive patterns that lack physical boundaries.;"[Barczak, Annamaria; O'Connell, Monica Noelle; McGinnis, Tammy; Ross, Deborah; Falchier, Arnaud; Lakatos, Peter] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Mowery, Todd] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lakatos, Peter] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; New York University; New York University";"Lakatos, P (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Neuromodulat, Translat Neurosci Div, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;Lakatos, P (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10016 USA.";Peter.Lakatos@NKI.rfmh.org;;"Barczak, Annamaria/0000-0002-0829-1768; Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021; Falchier, Arnaud/0000-0003-2426-3975";"NIH from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC012947]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH109289]";"NIH from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders; National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";Support for this work was provided by NIH Grants R01DC012947 from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and R01MH109289 from the National Institute of Mental Health.;;88;36;36;0;7;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

To establish whether the corticothalamic projection originating from motor cortical areas in primates exhibits the same duality, the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine was injected in eight macaque monkeys in the primary motor (M1; n = 3), the supplementary motor (SMA; n = 3) and the dorsal premotor (PMd; n = 2) cortical areas to label corticothalamic axons. The corticothalamic projection originating from these three motor cortical areas was characterized by the presence of axon terminals constituting the same two types of endings, observed both as boutons en passant and terminaux. The population of small endings exhibited a mean cross-sectional maximum diameter of 0.95 mu m (S.D. = 0.23), a range of diameters not overlapping that of giant endings (mean diameter = 3.46 mu m, S.D. = 0.74 mu m). Topographically, the giant endings originating from M1 were located in the same thalamic nucleus (ventroposterolateral nucleus, oral part) in which the small endings were found. In contrast, the giant endings originating from SMA and PMd were located in a thalamic nucleus (mediodorsal nucleus) distinct from the main termination zone formed by small endings. Along the rostrocaudal axis, the giant endings were distributed in a restricted zone, irrespective of the origin of the projection (M1, SMA, PMd). The dual morphology of corticothalamic endings, previously found in rodents and cats, is present in the motor system of subhuman primates for both primary and nonprimary motor cortical areas.

Neural responses were sorted on the basis of the trial-to-trial visibility of the stimulus, as reported by the animals. We found that neurons in the dorsal and ventral pulvinar, but not the LGN, showed changes in spiking rate according to stimulus visibility. Passive viewing control sessions showed such modulation to be independent of the monkeys' active report. Perceptual suppression was also accompanied by a marked drop in low-frequency power (9-30 Hz) of the local field potential (LFP) throughout the visual thalamus, but this modulation was not observed during passive viewing.

None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP used significantly affected the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF as determined by Raichle's (H2O)-O-15 method), and 10 mg/kg of R-THBP had little effect on the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) in the Rhesus monkey brain, as assessed by the graphical [F-18]fluoro-deoxyglucose method. The effect of R-THBP on the muscarinic cholinergic system was dose dependent; while 3 mg/kg of R-THBP did not significantly alter the uptake ratio of N-[C-11]methyl-benztropine in several brain regions to that in the cerebellum, 10 and 30 mg/kg of R-THBP significantly reduced the uptake ratio in the thalamus, as well as in the frontal and temporal cortices. None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP tested affected [C-11]SCH23390 (dopamine D-1 receptor) binding. However, the k3 value for N-[C-11]methyl-spiperone (dopamine D-2 receptor) binding, which represents the association rate x B-max value, was significantly decreased in the striatum. The uptake ratio of (+)[C-11]UH232 (dopamine D-3 receptor) in the striatum to that in the cerebellum was also decreased by administration of R-THBP (3 and 30 mg/kg i.v.). These findings suggest that R-THBP acts on dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors selectively without markedly affecting dopamine D-1 receptor binding.

To facilitate use with ventriculography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other noninvasive imaging techniques, the stereotaxic space is referenced to internal landmarks, viz., the anterior commissure and posterior commissure; the center of the anterior commissure at the midline is the origin of the stereotaxic ages. Reference of stereotaxis to this bicommissural space facilitates structural comparison with human brain atlases, which are commonly referenced to the biocommissural line. It also facilitates comparison of brains of different nonhuman primate species by providing a template brain against which to compare size and internal variability, Thirty-three coronal sections at l-mm intervals from the spinomedullary junction to the rostral extreme of the caudate nucleus show most structures of the hindbrain, midbrain, and subcortical forebrain, Separately, four side views and 16 coronal sections show cortical structures. Structures are represented by outlines of their boundaries and labeled according to NeuroNames, a systematic English nomenclature of human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomy.

We have begun studies of the monkey visual system to investigate the location and nature of these changes as well as to answer general questions about the effects of aging on neural structure and function. We began with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) because it is the main structure through which visual information passes on the way to cortex and because the parallel parvicellular and magnocellular pathways are most easily identified and studied in the LGN. In the present experiment, we determined the sizes, densities, and numbers of LGN neurons in young-adult (5 to 12.5 years) and old (23 to 27.5 years) rhesus monkeys. The measures were corrected for tissue shrinkage, and stereological procedures were used that yield unbiased estimates. In young-adult monkeys, neuron densities were lower in the magnocellular layers (about 14,000/mm3) than in the parvicellular layers (23,000/mm3). Neuron density increased about 28% from anterior to posterior in both types of layers. There was an average of approximately 1,267,000 neurons in the parvicellular layers and 148,000 neurons in the magnocellular layers; however, there was substantial variability (1.9-fold) among five brains studied. Aging produced a statistically significant decrease in neuron density in both the magnocellular (29% average decrease) and parvicellular (41% average decrease) layers. However, there was no significant loss of neurons. Rather, the density decrease was due to a small (nonsignificant) decrease in the number of neurons combined with a small (nonsignificant) increase in LGN volume. The increase in LGN volume was due to a significant increase in neuron soma-size and proportional increases in the volume of glial cells, blood vessels, and neuropil. These results, together with those of other studies, suggest that the effects of aging on the primate visual pathway from retina through striate cortex are relatively subtle. It is possible that the major neural changes occur more centrally. Alternatively, individual differences in the effects of aging may require much larger samples or prior screening to observe consistent changes.

Studies already demonstrated that the pharmacological disinhibition of the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic GPe produced dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical regions altered by the disinhibition of each GPe functional territory. Thus, 5 macaques were injected with bicuculline in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic sites of the GPe producing dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, and underwent in vivo positron tomography with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to identify cortical dysfunctions related to GPe disinhibition. Blood cortisol levels were also quantified as a biomarker of anxiety for each condition. Our results showed that pallidal bicuculline injections in anesthetized animals reproducibly modified the activity of specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas depending on the pallidal territory targeted. Bicuculline injections in the limbic GPe led to increased ipsilateral activations in limbic cortical regions (anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). Injections in the associative vs. sensorimotor GPe increased the activity in the ipsilateral midcingulate vs. somatosensory and parietal cortices. Moreover, bicuculline injections increased blood cortisol levels only in animals injected in their limbic GPe. These are the first functional results supporting the model of opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops where modifications in a functional pallidal territory can impact cortical activities of the same functional territory but also cortical activities of other functional territories. This highlights the importance of the GPe as a crucial node in the top-down control of the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits from the frontal cortex to influence the perception, attention, and emotional processes at downstream (or non-frontal) cortical levels. Finally, we showed the implication of the ventral pallidum with the amygdala and the insular cortex in a circuit related to aversive processing that should be crucial for the production of anxious disorders.;"[Galineau, Laurent] Univ Tours, UMR INSERM U930, Tours, France; [Kas, Aurelie] UPMC Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Pitie Salpetriere Hop, AP HP,CNRS UMR 7371,INSERM U1146,Dept Nucl Med, F-75013 Paris, France; [Worbe, Yulia] UMPC Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Pitie Salpetriere Hop, Dept Neurol,ICM, F-75013 Paris, France; [Chaigneau, Marion; Herard, Anne-Sophie; Guillermier, Martine; Delzescaux, Thierry; Hantraye, Philippe] CEA UMR 9199, MIRCEN, 18 Route Panorama, F-92260 Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Feger, Jean] UPMC Univ Paris 6, UMR S975, CRICM Ctr Rech Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France; [Tremblay, Leon] Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Neurosci Cognit, CNRS, UMR 5229, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Tours; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Paul-Brousse - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Hotel-Dieu - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Saint-Louis - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1";Tremblay, L (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Neurosci Cognit, CNRS, UMR 5229, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France.;leon.tremblay@isc.cnrs.fr;"Worbe, Yulia/GYV-3751-2022; Tremblay, Leon/H-1559-2017; HERARD, Anne-Sophie/K-5838-2013; Galineau, Laurent/P-8140-2016";"Tremblay, Leon/0000-0001-8370-6903; HERARD, Anne-Sophie/0000-0001-8260-9618; Worbe, Yulia/0000-0001-5903-9370; Galineau, Laurent/0000-0003-4960-1643";Agence Nationale de Recherche, France [ANR-05-NEUR-015-01];Agence Nationale de Recherche, France(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR));This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de Recherche, France (Grant number ANR-05-NEUR-015-01).;;82;10;10;0;10;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NEUROIMAGE;Neuroimage;FEB 1;2017;146;;;;;;1025;1037;;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.039;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.039;;;13;"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";EL3ZX;27989846;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000394560700089;View Full Record in Web of Science

Focal iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer, biocytin, were made into the vMGB of neonatal rabbits to examine the morphological organization of auditory thalamocortical (TC) afferents prior to hearing onset. TC afferents terminated in distinct patches as early as postnatal day 1 (PD-0 = day of birth), 6 days before the behavioral onset of hearing. In contrast to TC afferents in adults, the terminal arbors of neonatal vMGB axons occupied the entire depth of the cortical plate and lamina I. Serial section reconstructions revealed that single vMGB axons in neonates branched to form multiple patches within the cortical plate. Collaterals also extended to lamina I where they coursed tangentially for several millimeters. An unusual feature of the neonatal TC patches was the contribution of descending collaterals from axons coursing in lamina I. The presence of distinct patches prior to hearing onset indicates that the segregation of auditory TC axons occurs in the absence of acoustically driven activity.

We employed a triple-labeling technique in the same owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The cerebellothalamic projections were labeled with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the pallidothalamic projections were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine. The pre-SMA was identified by location and movement patterns evoked by intracortical microstimulation and injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Brain sections were processed sequentially using different chromogens to visualize all three tracers in the same section. Alternate sections were processed for Nissl cytoarchitecture or acetylcholinesterase chemoarchitecture for nuclear boundaries. The cerebellar nuclei primarily projected to posterior (VLp), medial (VLx), and dorsal (VLd) divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus; the pallidum largely projected to the anterior division (VLa) of the ventral lateral nucleus and the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). However, we also found zones of overlapping projections, as well as interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label, particularly in border regions of the VLa and VApc. Thalamic neurons labeled by pre-SMA injections occupied a wide band and were especially concentrated in the VLx and VApc, cerebellar and pallidal territories, respectively. Labeled thalamocortical neurons overlapped cerebellar inputs in the VLd and VApc and overlapped pallidal inputs in the VLa and the ventral medial nucleus. The results demonstrate that inputs from both the cerebellum and globus pallidus are relayed to the pre-SMA. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:164-180, 2000.

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has, however, not been thoroughly examined in terms of this complex structure, which has connections with most brain regions of central interest in schizophrenia research. The aim of the present study was to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. Method: The authors used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]FLB457 to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in thalamic subregions of 10 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. Binding potential was calculated by the reference tissue method and used as an index for dopamine D-2 receptor binding. Comparisons were made with 19 healthy subjects. Subregions of interest were de-fined on individual magnetic resonance images using a percentage-based operational approach. Clinical symptoms were rated by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: The [C-11]FLB457 binding potential was lower in the central medial and posterior subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. At a functional level, there was a significant negative correlation between binding potential and BPRS positive symptom scores. Conclusions: The subregions with low D-2 receptor binding comprise primarily the dorsomedial nucleus and pulvinar, two important components in circuitries previously suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission in thalamic subregions might be a mechanism underlying positive symptoms in schizophrenia.;"Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Brain Imaging Project, Inage Ku, Chiba 2638555, Japan; Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Biofunct Informat, Grad Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Tokyo, Japan; Jikei Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin & Neurosci, Psychiat Sect, Stockholm, Sweden";"National Institutes for Quantum Science & Technology; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); Jikei University; Karolinska Institutet";Suhara, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Brain Imaging Project, Inage Ku, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Chiba 2638555, Japan.;suhara@nirs.go.jp;;Farde, Lars/0000-0003-1297-0816;;;;;57;85;88;0;6;AMER PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING, INC;WASHINGTON;800 MAINE AVE SW, SUITE 900, WASHINGTON, DC 20024 USA;0002-953X;1535-7228;;AM J PSYCHIAT;Am.

In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons; in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.";NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA;New York University;Disney, AA (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;anita@nyu.edu;Aoki, Chiye/T-9405-2019;"Aoki, Chiye/0000-0003-4010-9425; Disney, Anita/0000-0003-3390-0681";"NEI NIH HHS [R01-EY13145, EY15549, P30-EY13079, EY8300, R01 EY008300, R01 EY013145, R03 EY015549, P30 EY013079-079003, P30 EY013079, R01 EY013145-04] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01-NS41091, R01 NS041091, R25 NS080686, R01 NS041091-04] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;66;237;238;0;13;CELL PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA;0896-6273;;;NEURON;Neuron;NOV 21;2007;56;4;;;;;701;713;;10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.034;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.034;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;236MH;18031686;Green Accepted, Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000251306600012;View Full Record in Web of Science

GABA(B) transcript expression was widespread and of much higher density in the dorsal thalamus than in the reticular nucleus and other parts of the ventral thalamus and was highest in the epithalamus. In the dorsal thalamus, highest mRNA levels were found in the anteroventral nucleus and in the parafascicular nucleus. Sensory relay nuclei showed moderate GABA(B) mRNA levels. Neurons of all sizes mere labeled, suggesting expression in relay cells and interneurons, and there was no labeling of neuroglial cells. Following 10-day periods of monocular deprivation, levels of GABA(B) mRNA were decreased in the deprived magno- and parvo-cellular laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei, indicating activity-dependent regulation. High levels of GABA(B) receptors in the dorsal thalamus are likely to reflect the high density of synaptic inputs from the reticular nucleus while low expression in the reticular nucleus implies weak, GABA(B)-mediated intrareticular inhibition.

In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque. These SPP1 mRNA-positive neurons were most abundant in the primary motor area, followed by Brodmann area 5 and the supplementary motor area, in accordance with the distribution of corticospinal neurons. In addition, injection of a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer into the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) of the spinal cord caused labeling of SPP1 positive neurons, indicating the expression of SPP1 in corticospinal neurons. SPP1 was also expressed in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal ventral horn of the rhesus macaque. Although SPP1 was also detected in the brainstem and spinal cord of the marmoset and the rat, it was not detected in their cerebral cortices. Selective expression in the corticospinal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque suggests that SPP1 plays a critical role in the functional or structural specialization of highly developed corticospinal systems in certain primate species.

The midline and intralaminar nuclear complex taken as a whole projects to widespread, predominantly frontal, cortical areas. Each of the constituent thalamic nuclei has a restricted cortical projection field that overlaps only slightly with the projection fields of adjacent midline and intralaminar nuclei. The projections of the intralaminar nuclei cover a larger cortical area than those of the midline nuclei. The laminar distributions of fibres from individual midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are different and include both deep and superficial cortical layers. The parataenial, paraventricular and intermediodorsal midline nuclei each project to circumscribed parts of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. In the prefrontal cortex, the projections are restricted to the medial orbital, infralimbic, ventral prelimbic and agranular insular fields, and the rostral part of the ventral anterior cingular cortex. In contrast to the other midline nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus projects to widespread cortical areas. The rostral intralaminar nuclei innervate dorsal parts of the prefrontal cortex, i.e. the dorsal parts of the prelimbic, anterior cingular and dorsal agranular insular cortical fields, the lateral and ventrolateral orbital areas, and the caudal part of the ventral anterior cingular cortex. Additional projections are aimed at the agranular fields of the motor cortex and the caudal part of the parietal cortex. The lateral part of the parafascicular nucleus send fibres predominantly to the lateral agranular field of the motor cortex and the rostral part of the parietal cortex. The medial part of the parafascicular nucleus projects rather sparsely to the dorsal part of the prelimbic cortex, the anterior cingular cortex and the medial agranular field of the motor cortex. Individual midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are thus in a position to directly influence circumscribed areas of the cerebral cortex. In combination with previously reported data on the organization of the midline and intralaminar thalamostriatal projections and the prefrontal corticostriatal projections the present results suggest a high degree of differentiation in the convergence of thalamic and cortical afferent fibres in the striatum. Each of the recently described parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits can thus be expanded to include projections at both the cortical and striatal levels from a specific part of the midline and intralaminar nuclear complex. The distinctive laminar distributions of the fibres originating from the different nuclei emphasize the specificity of the midline and intralaminar thalamocortical projections.;;;BERENDSE, HW (corresponding author), FREE UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL, VANDERBOECHORSTSTR 7, 1081 BT AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;;;Berendse, Henk/0000-0002-9189-3662;;;;;159;409;415;0;17;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;;1991;42;1;;;;;73;102;;10.1016/0306-4522(91)90151-D;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(91)90151-D;;;30;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;FK269;1713657;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991FK26900007;View Full Record in Web of Science

They are termed caudal and rostral forelimb areas (CFA and RFA). In this study, it was confirmed first that RFA and CFA are located in cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (medial and lateral parts of agranular cortex (AGm and AGI), respectively). In the second part of this study, the distribution of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to RFA and CFA was quantitatively compared by injections of small and relatively constant amounts of retrograde fluorescent dyes (diamidino yellow and fast blue) into these areas. It was observed that (1) main inputs to RFA originated from AGI, namely CFA (2) CFA received dominant inputs from AGm including RFA and caudally adjacent granular cortex and (3) wider cortical areas and larger number of neurons projected to CFA than to RFA. As for the thalamocortical projections, both RFA and CFA received inputs from various thalamic nuclei, such as VL, VM, Po, PC, PF, CL, but cells projecting to RFA and CFA were differentially located in each nucleus. It was found that labeled cell number and/or density in VM, PC, CL, CM and MD after RFA injections were significantly larger than those after CFA injections. On the other hand, labeled cell number and/or density in VPL and VL were significantly higher after CFA injections than after RFA injections. In comparison with findings in primates, the results suggest that the cortical motor areas of rats may be specialized for different aspects of motor control.

It has been dogma in sensory systems that the thalamic feedforward input is relatively weak and that there is a large amplification of the input signal by recurrent feedback. Here we show that in trichromatic primates there is a major feedforward input to layer 4C of primary visual cortex. Using a combination of 3D-electron-microscopy and 3D-confocal imaging of thalamic boutons we found that the average feedforward contribution was about 20% of the total excitatory input in the parvocellular (P) pathway, about 3 times the currently accepted values for primates. In the magnocellular (M) pathway it was around 15%, nearly twice the currently accepted values. New methods showed the total synaptic and cell densities were as much as 150% of currently accepted values. The new estimates of contributions of feedforward synaptic inputs into visual cortex call for a major revision of the design of the canonical cortical circuit.;"[Garcia-Marin, Virginia; Kelly, Jenna G.; Hawken, Michael J.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA";New York University;Hawken, MJ (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, 4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.;michael.hawken@nyu.edu;Garcia-Marin, Virginia/HTP-8168-2023;Garcia-Marin, Virginia/0009-0009-7518-8179;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [EY17945, P30 EY013079, T32 EY007136, NS088906]; Simons Foundation [349247]; Empire State Development Division of Science, Technology & Innovation (NYSTAR); NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM103310]; NIH [S10 RR029300-01]";"National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Simons Foundation; Empire State Development Division of Science, Technology & Innovation (NYSTAR); NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants: EY17945, P30 EY013079, T32 EY007136, and NS088906.

Because MD is reciprocally interconnected with prefrontal and agranular insular cortical areas, it provides a relay of ventral forebrain activity to these cortical areas. However, there are also direct projections from the piriform cortex and the amygdala to the prefrontal and agranular insular cortices. This study addresses whether this system has a triangular organization, such that structures in the ventral forebrain project to interconnected areas in MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex. The thalamocortical projections of MD have been studied in experiments with injections of retrograde tracers into prefrontal or agranular insular cortical areas. In many of the same experiments, projections from the ventral forebrain to MD and to the prefrontal/insular cortex have been demonstrated with anterograde axonal tracers. The connections of the piriform cortex (PC) with MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex form an organized triangular system. The PC projections to the central and medial segments of MD and to the lateral orbital cortex (LO) and the ventral and posterior agranular insular cortices (AI(v) and AI(p)) are topographically organized, such that more caudal parts of PC tend to project more medially in MD and more caudally within the orbital/insular cortex. The central and medial portions of MD also send matching, topographically organized projections to LO, AI(v) and AI(p), with more medial parts of MD projecting further caudally. The anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala (CO(a)) also projects to the dorsal part of the medial segment of MD and to its cortical targets, the medial orbital area (MO) and AI(p). The projections of the basal/accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei to MD and to prefrontal cortex, and from MD to amygdaloceptive parts of prefrontal cortex, are not as tightly organized. Amygdalothalamic afferents in MD are concentrated in the dorsal half of the medial segment. Cells in this part of the nucleus project to the amygdaloceptive prelimbic area (PL) and AI(p). However, other amygdaloceptive prefrontal areas are connected to parts of MD that do not receive fibers from the amygdala. Ventral pallidal afferents are distributed to all parts of the central and medial segments of MD, overlapping with the fibers from the amygdala and piriform cortex. Fibers from other parts of the pallidum, or related areas such as the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, terminate in the lateral and ventral parts of MD, where they overlap with inputs from the superior colliculus and other brainstem structures. Thus, pallidal or pallidum-related inputs overlap with other afferents in all parts of MD.;WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, 660 S EUCLID AVE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);;;;;"NIDCD NIH HHS [R01DC00093] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHS [T32GM08151] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))";;;88;268;270;0;10;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

A model of unilateral peripheral neuropathy was developed in the cynomolgus macaque, a species that is phylogenetically close to humans. Nerve entrapment was induced by placing a 4 mm length of polyvinyl cuff around the left common sciatic nerve. Prior to nerve injury, stimulation of the foot with a range of non-noxious von Frey filaments (1, 4, 8, 15, and 26 g) did not evoke brain activation as observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two weeks after injury, stimulation of the ipsilateral foot with non-noxious filaments activated the contralateral insula/secondary somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). By contrast, no activation was observed with stimulation of the contralateral foot. Robust bilateral activation of thalamus was observed three to five weeks after nerve injury. Treatment with the clinical analgesic pregabalin reduced evoked activation of Ins/SII, thalamus and ACC whereas treatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant reduced activation of the ipsilateral (left) thalamus. Twelve to 13 weeks after nerve injury, treatment with pregabalin reduced evoked activation of all regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, brain activation persisted in most ROI, except the ACC, following aprepitant treatment. Activation of the contralateral Ins/SII and bilateral thalamus was observed six months after nerve injury and pregabalin treatment suppressed activation of these nuclei. The current findings demonstrated persistent changes in CNS neurons following nerve injury as suggested by activation with non-painful mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, it was possible to functionally distinguish between a clinically efficacious analgesic drug, pregabalin, from a drug that has not demonstrated significant clinical analgesic efficacy, aprepitant. In vivo neuroimaging in the current nonhuman model could enhance translatability.;"[Hama, Aldric; Yano, Mizuho; Sotogawa, Wakana; Fujii, Rintaro; Awaga, Yuji; Natsume, Takahiro; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki] Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Hayashi, Ikuo] Hamamatsu Pharma Res USA Inc, San Diego, CA USA";;Hama, A (corresponding author), Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Kita Ku, 1-3-7 Shinmiyakoda, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4312103, Japan.;aldric-hama@hpharma.jp;;;;;;;69;1;1;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;;1744-8069;;MOL PAIN;Mol.

Since tactile inputs to an opposable thumb are often spatially and temporally out of sync with inputs from the fingers, we hypothesized that inputs from the opposable thumb would be processed in an independent module in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). Here we show that in area 3b of macaque monkeys, most neurons in the thumb representation do not respond to tactile stimulation of other digits and receive few intrinsic cortical inputs from other digits. However, neurons in the representations of other 4 digits respond to touch on any of the 4 digits and interconnect significantly more. The thumb inputs are thus processed in an independent module, whereas there is a significantly more interdigital information exchange between the other digits. This cortical organization reflects behavioral use of a hand with an opposable thumb.;"[Lazar, Leslee; Chand, Prem; Rajan, Radhika; Mohammed, Hisham; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122052, India; [Lazar, Leslee] Indian Inst Technol Gandhinagar, Ctr Cognit & Brain Sci, Gandhinagar 322385, India; [Chand, Prem] VBS Purvanchal Univ, Tilak Dhari Post Grad Coll, Dept Zool, Jaunpur 222002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rajan, Radhika] Champalimaud Fdn, Champalimaud Neurosci Programme, Lisbon, Portugal; [Jain, Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, Dept Biosci & Bioengn, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India; [Jain, Neeraj] Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, Sch AI & Data Sci, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Gandhinagar; Fundacao Champalimaud; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Jodhpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Jodhpur";Jain, N (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, NH 62, Jodhpur 342030, Rajasthan, India.;neeraj.jain@iitj.ac.in;"Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010; Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012";"Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781; Rajan, Radhika/0000-0002-8599-7203; Lazar, Leslee/0000-0002-2564-7324";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-I]";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)";"This work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India grant BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012, and funds from National Brain Research Centre to N.

However, most of these models have been established on lower animals, such as rodents, and involve only a single administration of a noxious stimulus. In this study, an inflammatory soup (10 mu L), consisting of prostaglandin E2 (0.2 mM), serotonin (2 mM), bradykinin (2 mM) and histamine (2 mM), was injected into the dura mater of conscious rhesus monkeys through an indwelling catheter. The in fusion started on day 8 and was repeated every 3 days, for a total of six administrations, to induce neurogenic inflammation. We performed behavioral assessments and measured the expression of the oncogcne c-fos, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the trigeminal system and in multiple brain regions involved in pain processing by immunohistochemical staining. Compared with monkeys in the control group, three of the four animals in the inflammatory soup group displayed decreased motor behaviors, and two showed increased ipsilateral nose and mouth secretions during the stimulus period. Higher expression levels of c-fos, nNOS and CGRP were found in various brain areas of experimental animals compared with controls, including the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and other areas involved in pain perception. These results suggest that repeated inflammatory soup stimulation of the dura activates the trigeminovascular system and produces migraine-like pathological changes and abnormal behaviors in conscious rhesus monkeys.;"[Chen, Ning; Su, Wei; Cui, Shu-Hui; Guo, Jian; He, Li] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Neurol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Su, Wei] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Duan, Jia-Chuan; Li, Hong-Xia] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Natl Chengdu Ctr Safety Evaluat Tradit Chinese Me, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China";"Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University";He, L (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Neurol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;heli2003new@126.com;;;National Natural Science Foundation of China [81500959];National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 81500959 (to NC).

Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study for neuron segmentation in such large-scale anatomical regions.;"[You, Zhenzhen; Shi, Zhenghao; Ning, Xiaojuan; Shi, Cheng; Du, Shuangli] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Shaanxi Key Lab Network Comp & Secur Technol, Xian, Peoples R China; [You, Zhenzhen; Herard, Anne-Sophie; Jan, Caroline; Souedet, Nicolas; Delzescaux, Thierry] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Malad Neurodegenerat, CNRS, Fontenay Aux Roses,MIRCen,CEA,UMR 9199, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Jiang, Ming] Xidian Univ, Natl Lab Radar Signal Proc, Xian, Peoples R China";"Xi'an University of Technology; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Xidian University";You, ZZ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Shaanxi Key Lab Network Comp & Secur Technol, Xian, Peoples R China.;zhenzhen_you89@163.com;;YOU, Zhenzhen/0000-0003-3882-4737;"French national funds (PIA2' program) [P112331-3422142]; Fund of Doctoral Start-up of Xi'an University of Technology [112/256081811]; General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076198]; Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China [2020GXLH-Y005]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [61901363, 61902313]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2020JM-463, 2020JQ-648, 2020JQ-652]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education [20JK0795]";"French national funds (PIA2' program); Fund of Doctoral Start-up of Xi'an University of Technology; General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education";"French national funds (PIA2' program), Grant/Award Number: P112331-3422142; Fund of Doctoral Start-up of Xi'an University of Technology, Grant/Award Number: 112/256081811; General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 62076198; Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China, Grant/Award Number: 2020GXLH-Y005; National Nature Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 61901363, 61902313; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, Grant/Award Numbers: 2020JM-463, 2020JQ-648, 2020JQ-652; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, Grant/Award Number: 20JK0795";;47;2;2;3;12;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1059-910X;1097-0029;;MICROSC RES TECHNIQ;Microsc.

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images providing a novel and accurate way of measuring very fine and local functional differences.

Striatal neurone degeneration is a hallmark in Huntington's disease and we were interested in estimating total neurone and glial number in this thalamic nuclear complex. Serial 500-mu m-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal sections of the left hemisphere from six cases of Huntington's disease patients (three females, three males) and six age- and sex-matched controls were investigated applying Cavalieri's principle and the optical disector. Mean neurone number in the controls was 646,952 +/- 129,668 cells versus 291,763 +/- 60,122 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Total glial cell number (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and unclassifiable glial profiles) was higher in controls with 9,544,191 +/- 3,028,944 versus 6,961,989 +/- 2,241,543 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.021). Considerable increase of fibrous astroglia within the centromedian-parafascicular complex could be observed after Gallyas' impregnation.

Decades of experimental and modeling work in the sensory cortex have demonstrated that a perceptual decision pool is usually composed of tens to hundreds of neurons, the responses of which are significantly correlated not only with each other, but also with the behavioral choices of an animal. Few studies, however, have measured neural activity in the sensory thalamus of awake, behaving animals. Therefore, it remains unclear how many thalamic neurons are recruited and how the information from these neurons is pooled at subsequent cortical stages to form a perceptual decision. In a previous study we measured neural activity in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) contrast detection task, and found that single LGN neurons were significantly correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices, despite their relatively poor contrast sensitivity and a lack of overall interneuronal correlations. We have now computationally tested a number of specific hypotheses relating these measured LGN neural responses to the contrast detection behavior of the animals. We modeled the perceptual decisions with different numbers of neurons and using a variety of pooling/readout strategies, and found that the most successful model consisted of about 50-200 LGN neurons, with individual neurons weighted differentially according to their signal-to-noise ratios (quantified as d-primes). These results supported the hypothesis that in contrast detection the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple thalamic neurons, and that the response fluctuations in these neurons can influence contrast perception, with the more sensitive thalamic neurons likely to exert a greater influence.;"[Jiang, Yaoguang; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Purushothaman, Gopathy; Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Casagrande, Vivien A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37240 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University";Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, PMB407935 RM U-3218 MRB 3,465 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [EY001778, EY025422, R21 EY019132, EY008126, HD15052]; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University";This work was supported by National Institutes of Health from grants EY001778 (VAC), EY025422 (VAC), R21 EY019132 (VAC), core grants EY008126 and HD15052, and funds from the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at Vanderbilt University.;;70;4;4;0;7;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5110;;;FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT;Front.

The results showed that areas 45A and 45B display reciprocal amygdalar connections, which appear to be considerably richer than those of their neighboring areas. Specifically, these two areas are a target of differentially weighted projections originating predominantly from the magnocellular and the intermediate subdivisions of the basal nucleus and are a source of projections mostly directed to the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus and the dorsal part of the lateral nucleus. The present data, together with previous data on the thalamic connectivity of areas 45A and 45B (Contini et al. Eur J Neurosci 32:1337-53, 2010), suggest that direct and indirect-trans-thalamic-amygdalar connectivity is a characterizing connectional feature of these two areas. Specifically, the amygdalar connections of area 45A, for which a role in communication behavior has been proposed, could convey information on the emotional significance of communicative signals to this area, where it could play a crucial role in guiding appropriate social interactions. Furthermore, the amygdalar connections of area 45B, possibly involved in higher-order aspects of visual guidance of gaze, could convey information related to the relevance of visual stimuli, which could contribute to a representation of priority maps in this VLPF area.;"[Gerbella, Marzio; Baccarini, Matteo; Borra, Elena; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Gerbella, Marzio; Baccarini, Matteo; Borra, Elena; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Ist Italiano Tecnol IIT, Rete Multidisciplinare Tecnol, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Unita Fisiol, I-43100 Parma, Italy";"University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT; University of Parma";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Unita Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019; Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016";"Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2008J7YFNR_002]; European Commission [FP7-250013]";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)";"The work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (Grant number: PRIN 2008, no. 2008J7YFNR_002); European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013.";;40;16;16;1;4;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

In 23 patients the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlu) was measured with positron emission tomography and the location and spatial extent of the stroke lesions were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor impairment during the acute and chronic stages (4 weeks after stroke) was determined by a motor score and recordings of magnetic evoked motor potentials. Twelve patients recovered significantly, whereas 11 patients retained a disabling hemiparesis. In contrast to patients with good motor recovery, rCMRGlu was severely depressed in the thalamus on the lesion side in patients with poor motor recovery. This patient group also showed more severe damage to the pyramidal tract on magnetic resonance images and a more pronounced reduction of the magnetic evoked motor potential amplitude. Neither the size of the stroke lesions nor the spatial extent of the lesional and remote rCMRGlu depressions outside the thalamus correlated with the thalamic hypometabolism and the improvement of the motor score.

J;Vakalopoulos, C;;;;Vakalopoulos, C;;;A theory of blindsight - The anatomy of the unconscious: A proposal for the koniocellular projections and intralaminar thalamus;MEDICAL HYPOTHESES;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"PATHWAY; CONSCIOUSNESS; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; MACAQUE; NUCLEI; CELLS; LIGHT";This paper extends the concepts introduced by the theory of premotor relations to unconscious cognitive mechanisms. According to the theory conscious mechanisms are associated with behavioural diversity, whereas unconscious output is proposed to have an obligatory association with stereotypical behaviour. The respective processes are by definition a function of the type of reafferent motor input. Concepts of simple and complex premotor networks are introduced as a means of describing unconscious and conscious processes, respectively. Evidence shows that unconscious cognitive performance differs qualitatively from conscious mechanisms suggesting parallel processes. Although the postulated anatomical substrates for conscious and unconscious processes will function in this model as parallel segregated networks, it is proposed they are distributed throughout the same cortical areas of the brain. Motor reafference is postulated to be mediated via pallidal projections to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which is known to modulate thalamocortical pathways. The role of the koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus remains an enigma and has some properties in common with the well-described magnocellular and parvocellular projections. There is also much speculation about the intralaminar and midline nuclei, the so-called non-specific thalamus. The paper will examine the distinctive features of thalamocortical networks and the role of the koniocellular pathway and intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus and suggest that they form a neuroanatomical substrate for the categorizing of unconscious cognitive processes. The ILN has unique projections back to the basal ganglia, which could serve in constraining associated neocortical networks with stereotypical behaviour and thus putative unconscious processing. Only after establishing such a theoretical framework can one hope to successfully analyze the empirical literature on the syndrome of blindsight, of which a detailed account is presented. Blindsight refers to the apparent visual abilities of patients with damage to the striate visual cortex (VI). Patients will 'guess' the shape of an object or reach towards it when presented in the blind field, in spite of denying actually seeing it, i.e., they are unconsciously aware of it. Unlike the magnocellular and parvocellular geniculate pathways the koniocellular extrastriate projections partially conserve retinal information in these patients. Could the proposed network represent an anatomical model of the Freudian subconscious? (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Upon generating a sequence, this model stores information on the serial order of components in a cortical buffer by means of theta-nested gamma frequency oscillations observed experimentally in cortico-striatal neurons. This model assumes the existence of at least two functionally different classes of striatal spiny neurons. One class of striatal projection neurons (S-cells) select the first component in the cortical buffer through a temporal winner-take-all mechanism implemented by lateral inhibition. The inhibition should last for at least a few hundred milliseconds. In reality, it may be mediated by GABAB receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cortico-striatal projection. The other class of striatal projection neurons (M-cells) retain the currently executed component in a cortico-BG-thalamic loop, for which the strong nonlinearity in transitions between up and down states of striatal neurons is crucial. For sequence generation at the level of striatum, the cortical neurons encoding the component selected for execution are inactivated by the feedback from the activated cortico-BG-thalamic loop. This model predicts that the transition to next component is triggered by a single external signal, i.e. the subthalamic input to the globus pallidum. This input gives a neural substrate for adjusting the rate of sequence generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It receives input from both the basal ganglia and cerebellum, and forms reciprocal connections with motor cortical areas. The current study examined the activity in cat VL thalamus neurons during instrumentally conditioned vocalization. Units in our sample showed irregular spontaneous firing which could be modulated by slowly occurring fluctuations in intensity of vocalization task performance. Two main types of behavioral events were associated with changes in neural firing rate. The first of these was the ingestion of food reward. More than half of all recordings showed phasic bursting patterns during licking; a similar number had increases in firing preparatory to this phasic activity. The second behavioral event modulating unit responses was vocalization. Approximately 60% of recordings showed activity changes time-locked to vocalization. These responses were almost always excitatory, and often involved changes in firing that preceded vocalization onset. No spatial organization of differences in firing pattern between neurons could be distinguished. Our results suggest that VL thalamus may well be involved in mediating vocal behavior, although its functional role remains an object of speculation.

Thalamic activity may be related to cerebellar tremor because transmission of some cerebellar efferent signals occurs via the thalamus and cortex to the periphery. We have now studied thalamic neuronal activity in a cerebellar relay nucleus (ventral intermediate-Vim) and a pallidal relay nucleus (ventralis oral posterior-Vop) during thalamotomy in patients with intention tremor and other clinical signs of cerebellar disease (tremor patients). The activity of single neurons and the simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity of the contralateral upper extremity in tremor patients performing a pointing task were analyzed by spectral cross-correlation analysis. EMG spectra during intention tremor often showed peaks of activity in the tremor-frequency range (1.9-5.8 Hz). There were significant differences in thalamic neuronal activity between tremor patients and controls. Neurons in Vim and Vop had significantly lower firing rates in tremor patients than in patients undergoing thalamic surgery for pain (pain controls). Other studies have shown that inputs to Vim from the cerebellum are transmitted through excitatory connections. Therefore the present results suggest that tremor in these tremor patients is associated with deafferentation of the thalamus from cerebellar efferent pathways. The thalamic X EMG cross-correlation functions were studied for cells located in Vim and Vop. Neuronal and EMG activity were as likely to be significantly correlated for cells in Vim as for those in Vop. Cells in Vim were more likely to have a phase lag relative to EMG than were cells in Vop. In monkeys, cells in the cerebellar relay nucleus of the thalamus, corresponding to Vim, are reported to lead movement during active oscillations at the wrist. In view of these monkey studies, the present results suggest that cells in Vim are deafferented and have a phase lag relative to tremor that is not found in normal active oscillations. The difference in phase of thalamic spike X EMG activity between Vim and Vop may contribute to tremor because lesions of pallidum or Vop are reported to relieve cerebellar tremor.;"Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA";"Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine";Lenz, FA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Meyer Bldg 7-113,600 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-39498, NS-40059] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;64;34;35;0;5;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

These data were compared to the total population of LCN neurons as determined by Nissl stain. In 4 Macaca fascicularis and one Saimiri sciureus the average size of the thalamic projection from LCN was found to be 506 +/- 94 cells contralateral to the injections. Thalamically projecting LCN neurons were located between the lower medulla and the third cervical segment; approximately 90% of these cells were in the first two cervical segments. Morphologic analysis of thalamically projecting LCN cells showed that they were smaller in size, and more oblong in shape in caudal regions of the nucleus. In 3 macaques, the average total number of LCN cells was determined to be 1617 +/- 908 on one side, in Nissl material. In these Nissl-stained preparations LCN neurons were found as far caudal as the fourth cervical segment; 68% were located in the first two cervical segments.

Comparison of these data with reports in the literature imply that, unlike the cat, the major projection from LCN in monkeys is to the mesencephalon rather than to the thalamus.";SUNY HLTH SCI CTR, NEUROSURG RES LABS, 766 IRVING AVE, 3118 WEISKOTTEN HALL, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";;;;Apkarian, A.

Using [C-11](R)PKI1195, a sensitive in vivo marker of glial cell activation, and PET, we provide first evidence that limb denervation induces a trans-synaptic increase in [C-11](R)-PKI1195 binding in the human thalamus but not somatosensory cortex: these brain structures appeared morphologically normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity. Our findings support the view that long-term rearrangement of cortical representational maps is significantly determined within the thalamus.

Normal right-handed subjects (eight men, eight women, average age=32 years) viewed four types of stimuli positioned to the right or left of the central fixation point (left hemifield-large letter, left hemitield-small letter display with flanking letters; fight hemifield-large letter, fight hemifield-small letter display with flankers). BOLD responses to small letters surrounded by flankers were compared with responses to large isolated letters. To examine maximum functional regional connectivity, we modeled subject as a random effect and attained fixed effect parameter estimates and t-statistics for functional connectivity between each of the thalamic nuclei (pulvinar, medial dorsal, and anterior) as the seed region and each non-seed voxel. Greater BOLD activation for letters surrounded by flankers than for large letters was observed in the pulvinar as anticipated and was also marked in the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN), anterior and superior cingulate (BA24 and BA24' dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontal operculum and insula. For the MDN, maximal functional connectivity was with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; correlations with left superior temporal, parietal, posterior frontal, and occipital regions were also observed. For the pulvinar, maximal functional connectivity was with parietal BA39; for anterior thalamus, with anterior cingulate.

Consequently, a hypothetical disruption of functions mediated by the pulvinar may help understand common visual and nonvisual symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. To test this hypothesis, the pulvinar nuclei of nine patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and twelve young (9-28 years of age) and age-matched controls (without dementia and with non-Alzheimer dementias) were examined using a battery of histopathological methods. All patients with Alzheimer's disease had numerous amyloid plaques and some neuritic plaques throughout the various subdivisions of the pulvinar. Neuropil threads were also present among the senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles occurred in clusters throughout the nucleus. Control patients with and without dementia had very few Alzheimer lesions, which should be expected in normal elderly individuals. The lesions in the pulvinar may help understand some of the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, including deficits in attention and in a host of visual disturbances. Such deficits may be the result of involvement of reciprocal thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits that appear to be critical for the function of a vast expanse of association cortices interconnected with the pulvinar, which are heavily laden with lesions themselves.;VET AFFAIRS MED CTR, IOWA CITY, IA USA;"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Iowa City VA Health Care System";KULJIS, RO (corresponding author), UNIV IOWA, DEPT NEUROL, RCP 2143, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA.;;;Kuljis, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4254-8838;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR 05372] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS 29856] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;79;41;41;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0022-3069;1554-6578;;J NEUROPATH EXP NEUR;J.

We combined fluorescent retrograde tracers with a double anterograde labeling technique. Multiple injections of a combination of Diamidino Yellow and Fast Blue were made into either the MI or SMA hand/arm representation as determined by intracortical microstimulation. In the same animal, biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the GPi and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei. The results revealed that the cerebellar and pallidal thalamic territories are largely separate. The ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) contained a greater density of pallidal labeling while a greater density of cerebellar label was observed more caudally in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) as well as in nucleus X (X). Moreover, we observed that the greatest coincidence of retrograde cell labeling was within the pallidal thalamic territory following the SMA injections and within the cerebellar thalamic territory following the MI injections. However, interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label were also observed particularly in the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc). In both VLo and VLc, we additionally observed coincidence between the cerebellar labeling and SMA projection neurons as well as between pallidal labeling and MI projection neurons. These data suggest that while MI primarily receives inputs originating from Cb and SMA primarily receives inputs originating from GPi, it also appears that MI and SMA receive secondary afferents arising from GPi and Cb, respectively.;"Michigan State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Anat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 444, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Sendai, Miyagi 980, Japan";"Michigan State University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Tohoku University";Sakai, ST (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 517 W Fee Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Sakai@msu.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-38564] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;38;41;41;0;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0899-0220;1369-1651;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals.

Injections were placed in the major somatotopic divisions of M1 (the hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, and face representations) and in the caudal and rostral M1 subareas. In most cases, we injected several differentiable tracers into different parts of M1. Our results indicate that the strongest connections of M1 are with subdivisions of the ventral lateral thalamus (VL); other connections are mainly with intralaminar nuclei (the central lateral, paracentral, and center median nuclei) and the reticular nucleus. Most projections are reciprocal and topographically organized. M1 is strongly connected with the principal (VLp), medial (VLx), and anterior (VLa) subdivisions of the VL complex but has at most weak connections with the dorsal division (VLd). Each of the major somatotopic divisions of M1 is connected with an anteroposteriorly elongated territory within the VL complex. The connections are somatotopically organized such that the M1 hindlimb representation is connected with a band of cells in the lateral and anterior portions of the VL complex (spanning VLa and VLp), whereas the trunk, forelimb, and face representations are connected with successively more medially and posteriorly situated cell bands (spanning VLa, VLp, and VLx). There is some degree of overlap between the somatotopic territories within VL, although the absence of double-labeled cells in cases with injections of adjacent somatotopic divisions of M1 suggests that individual thalamic neurons project to single somatotopic regions. In addition to somatotopic differences, the connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of M1 differ to some extent. Caudal M1 is connected most strongly with VLp, a target of cerebellar projections, but it is also connected with VLa, which receives pallidal inputs. In complementary fashion, rostral M1 is most strongly connected with VLa, but it is also connected with VLp. VLx, a target of cerebellar projections, has significant connections with both caudal and rostral M1. These results indicate that all parts of M1 are influenced by both the cerebellum and globus pallidus in owl monkeys, as has been suggested in some recent studies of macaque monkeys.

The human MD thalamic nucleus has been implicated in a great variety of different clinical conditions and normal functions ranging from schizophrenia, Parkinsonism and epilepsy to many cognitive functions. In the rat the MD thalamic nucleus is divided into three cytoarchitectonic sectors whereas in the primates it is divided into two; medial one-third (magnocellular) and lateral two-thirds further the lateral sector is divided into pars parvocellularis pars multiformis, pars fasciculosa and pars caudalis. In this study we used a retrograde tracer, fluoro-gold (FG) to evaluate some of the afferents reaching the lateral sector of the MD (MDl) thalamic nucleus. The results of the present study have shown that MDl receives afferent connections from the lateral cerebellar nucleus (dentate nucleus), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and zona incerta (ZI). Subsequent to FG injections into the MDl, labeled cells were observed mainly bilaterally but were sparser on the contralateral side than ipsilaterally from each of the three structures listed. All three afferents showed a topographical organization. The labeled neurons were localized at the dorsomedial aspect of the lateral cerebellar nucleus, the dorsoventral aspect of the SNR and in the dorsal sector of the ZI. The lateral cerebellar nucleus reached the MDl via the superior cerebellar peduncle. No other deep cerebellar nuclei showed labeled cells. There were no labeled cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). Although the three regions identified here are recognized as having motor functions, the connections to MD suggest that their outputs also play a role in cognitive or other higher cortical functions.";"[Cavdar, Safiye; Ozgur, Merve; Uysal, Sanem Pinar; Amuk, Ozge Ceren] Koc Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey";Koc University;Cavdar, S (corresponding author), Koc Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.;scavdar@ku.edu.tr;"Çavdar, Safiye/AAH-8585-2019; Amuk Williams, Ozge/ITU-9689-2023";"Cavdar, Safiye/0000-0002-8847-9882; Ozgur Erat, Merve/0000-0002-0909-8433";;;;;64;5;5;0;7;IMR PRESS;WAN CHAI;RM 19C, LOCKHART CTR, 301-307 LOCKHART RD, WAN CHAI, 00000, HONG KONG;0219-6352;1757-448X;;J INTEGR NEUROSCI;J.

Anat. Entwicklungsgesch. 129:53-82). The present study examined their possible contribution to the development of other thalamic nuclei. Postmortem brain tissue from human fetuses ranging between 10.5 and 40 weeks of gestation (wg) was processed by Nissl staining, Golgi impregnation, and MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) immunocytochemistry. The gangliothalamic body, suggested to serve as a conduit for cells migrating from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus, was found in the period from 15 to 34 wg in all rostrocaudal thalamic regions, particularly at the level of the anterior nuclear complex, mediodorsal and pulvinar nucleus, and in addition, the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Nissl-stained sections, the gangliothalamic body is a thin cellular layer situated beneath the thalamic surface, near the telencephalo-diencephalic junction. In Golgi- and MAP2-stained sections, it is a stream of mostly bipolar cells extending from the ganglionic eminence to the medial thalamus. In addition, MAP2-immunoreactivity confirms the neuronal nature of its cells. The present study further supports the hypothesis that certain neurons migrate from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus through the transient gangliothalamic body during fetal development. Moreover, our data indicate that both the association (mediodorsal and pulvinar), as well as the anterior (limbic) and specific relay nuclei are potential recipients of the telencephalic neurons.

A combination of single- and dual-tracer techniques was used to study their topography and to establish whether these zones occupy separate or overlapping pulvinar territories. In each case, the retinotopic distribution of tracer in the pulvinar was charted by reference to its parallel distribution within the maps of cortical areas V1 and V2. Each of the areas V3, V4, and V5 were found to connect with both the 1 degrees and the 2 degrees maps located within the inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei and to respect the previously identified topographies of these maps. However, V5 connects to a narrow zone lining the rostrolateral margin of the lateral and inferior pulvinar and V4 to a broader zone within the body of these two nuclei, which is adjacent to but separate from the V5 zone; the V3 zone overlaps both. Focal injections into cortex produce columns of pulvinar label whose trajectory defines a line of isorepresentation. The lines of isorepresentation in the 1 degrees and 2 degrees maps are approximately linear and parallel and adopt a rostrolateral to caudomedial aids; in the 1 degrees map, this aids is roughly perpendicular to the facet of the inferior pulvinar that hes adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The connections of V5 and V4 can be modelled as successive zones along the aids of isorepresentation, with registered visual topographies. The scheme is extended by existing reports that inferotemporal cortex connects to the caudomedial pole of this aids-reflecting an occipitotemporal cortical gradient, in that V1 and other prestriate areas, e.g., V3, connect to the opposite pole. Thus a simple model of the mapped volume in the pulvinar arises, in which a unidimensional cortical topography is represented orthogonally to retinal topography. Adjoining this volume medially, within the inferior and medial pulvinar, is a second, heavier zone of V5 connectivity, which is poorly topographic. Both the medial and the rostrolateral zones of V5 connectivity may overlap with previously identified regions of tectal input to the pulvinar.

The results indicate that both areas TE and TEO receive nonreciprocal inputs from several thalamic nuclei, including paracentralis, ventralis anterior, centralis, and limitans, and that TE also receives input from reuniens. Additional nonreciprocal inputs to both areas arise from the hypothalamus, basal nucleus of Meynert, dorsal and median raphe, locus coeruleus, and reticular formation. TE and TEO are reciprocally connected with the lateral, medial, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar and with the ventral portion of the claustrum. The main subcortical nonreciprocal output from TE and TEO is to the striatum and from TEO to the superior colliculus. TE also sends a very limited projection to nucleus medialis dorsalis magnocellularis of the thalamus. Although the connections of areas TE and TEO are overlapping in most subcortical structures, they are partially segregated in the pulvinar, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the striatum. Specifically, relative to those of TE, the projections of TEO are located more laterally in the medial, lateral, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar, more ventrally in the reticular nucleus, and more caudally in both the ventral putamen and tail and head of the caudate nucleus.

The anatomy and connectivity of the primate auditory cortex has been modeled as a core region receiving direct thalamic input surrounded by a belt of secondary fields. The core contains multiple tonotopic fields (including the primary auditory cortex, AI, and the rostral field, R), but available data only partially address the degree to which those fields are functionally distinct. This report, based on single-unit recordings across four hemispheres in awake macaques, argues that the functional organization of auditory cortex is best understood in terms of temporal processing. Frequency tuning, response threshold, and strength of activation are similar between AI and R, validating their inclusion as a unified core, but the temporal properties of the fields clearly differ. Onset latencies to pure tones are longer in R (median, 33 ms) than in AI (20 ms); moreover, synchronization of spike discharges to dynamic modulations of stimulus amplitude and frequency, similar to those present in macaque and human vocalizations, suggest distinctly different windows of temporal integration in AI (20-30 ms) and R (100 ms). Incorporating data from the adjacent auditory belt reveals that the divergence of temporal properties within the core is in some cases greater than the temporal differences between core and belt.";"[Scott, Brian H.; Malone, Brian J.; Semple, Malcolm N.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA";New York University;Scott, BH (corresponding author), NIMH, Neurochem Lab, NIH, 49 Convent Dr,Room 1B80, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;brianscott@mail.nih.gov;Scott, Brian H/G-7932-2012;Scott, Brian/0000-0003-3949-9737;"W.

Interposed between the thalamus and cortex, the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus intercepts and regulates communication between the two structures. Recent findings demonstrate that a unique circuitry links the prefrontal cortex with the reticular nucleus and may underlie the process of selective attention to enhance salient stimuli and suppress irrelevant stimuli in behavior. Unlike other cortices, some prefrontal areas issue widespread projections to the reticular nucleus, extending beyond the frontal sector to the sensory sectors of. the nucleus, and may influence the flow of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex. Unlike other thalamic nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus, which is the principal thalamic nucleus for the prefrontal cortex, has similarly widespread connections with the reticular nucleus. Unlike sensory association cortices, some terminations from prefrontal areas to the reticular nucleus are large, suggesting efficient transfer of information. We propose a model showing that the specialized features of prefrontal pathways in the reticular nucleus may allow selection of relevant information and override distractors, in processes that are deranged in schizophrenia.;"[Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, NEPRC, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zikopoulos, Basilis; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Boston University; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 431, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832";"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH057414-05, R01 MH057414] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS024760, R01 NS024760-18] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;183;104;106;1;20;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0334-1763;1607-8470;;REV NEUROSCIENCE;Rev.

GnIH can also directly inhibit reproductive behaviors, possibly via action within the brain. Identification of the distribution of GnIH neurons and fibers may provide us with clues to how the brain controls reproductive activities of the animal. Here, we characterized the location and connectivity of GnIH neurons in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) brain. We determined the macaque GnIH precursor mRNA, and further identified a mature GnIH peptide (SGRNMEVSLVRQVLNLPQRF-NH(2)) by mass spectrometry combined with immunoaffinity purification. The majority of GnIH precursor mRNA-positive and GnIH-immunoreactive (GnIH-ir) cell bodies were localized in the intermediate periventricular nucleus (IPe) in the hypothalamus, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Abundant GnIH-ir fibers were observed in the nucleus of the stria terminalis in the telencephalon; habenular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, IPe, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, median eminence and dorsal hypothalamic area in the diencephalon; medial region of the superior colliculus, central gray substance of the midbrain and dorsal raphe nucleus in the midbrain; and parabrachial nucleus in the pons.

The thalamus was stained immunocytochemically for parvalbumin and 28 kDa calbindin in normals and in brains in which retrogradely transported tracers were injected into middle layers of auditory cortical areas or applied to the cortical surface. Parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cells show a complementary distribution in ventral, anterodorsal, posterodorsal, and magnocellular medial geniculate nuclei. The ventral nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and few calbindin cells, and the anterodorsal nucleus has a high density of parvalbumin cells and moderate numbers of calbindin cells, Both nuclei have a dense parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuropil formed by terminations of fibers ascending in the brachium of the inferior colliculus. The posterodorsal nucleus has approximately equal proportions of parvalbumin and calbindin cells; neuropil staining is weak but contains terminations of calbindin-immunoreactive fibers ascending in the midbrain tegmentum. The magnocellular nucleus contains domains of parvalbumin and calbindin cells. Parvalbumin cells in the ventral nucleus project to a central core of auditory cortex with densest parvalbumin immunoreactivity. Those in anterodorsal and posterodorsal nuclei project to surrounding auditory fields with less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity; those in the magnocellular nucleus project widely to auditory and other fields. Injections of middle cortical layers label a large majority of parvalbumin cells in the ventral, anterodorsal, or posterodorsal nuclei and in the magnocellular nucleus. Superficial deposits label calbindin cells only, usually in more than one nucleus, implying a widespread projection system.

Comparable projections have yet to be described in the primate brain, where part of the problem has been in effectively delineating these nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue from a series of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) showed that cells in the region of both the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei selectively stain for parvalbumin, thus helping to reveal these nuclei. These same tegmental nuclei were not selectively revealed when tissue was stained for SMI32, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or calretinin. In a parallel study, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the mammillary bodies of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Retrogradely labeled neurons were consistently found in the three subdivisions of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, which are located immediately below, within, and above the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Further projections to the mammillary body region arose from cells in the anterior tegmental nucleus, which appears to be a rostral continuation of the infrafascicular part of the ventral tegmental nucleus. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, labeled cells were most evident when the tracer injection was more laterally placed in the mammillary bodies, consistent with a projection to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The present study not only demonstrates that the primate mammillary bodies receive parallel inputs from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden, but also helps to confirm the extent of these poorly distinguished nuclei in the monkey brain.

As in previous studies, the PPC could be distinguished by its input from the lateral posterior, lateral dorsal, and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but not the lateral geniculate nucleus or ventrobasal complex. These nuclei were also observed to receive reciprocal projections from the ipsilateral PPC. Cholinergic neurons innervating the PPC were primarily localized to the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis region. The implications of these data for possible functions of the cholinergic input to PPC are discussed.

This study was aimed at discovery of such a radioligand from a group of CAF(1), receptor ligands based on a core 3-(phenylamino)-pyrazin-2(1H)-one scaffold. Methods: CRF1 receptor ligands were selected for development as possible PET radioligands based on their binding potency at CRF1 receptors (displacement of [I-128]CRF from rat cortical membranes), measured lipophilicity, autoradiographic binding profile in rat and rhesus monkey brain sections, rat biodistribution, and suitability for radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Two identified candidates (BMS-721313 and BMS-732098) were labeled with fluorine-18. A third candidate (BMS-709460) was labeled with carbon-11 and all three radioligands were evaluated in PET experiments in rhesus monkey. CRF1 receptor density (B-rnax) was assessed in rhesus brain cortical and cerebellum membranes with the CRF1 receptor ligand, [H-3]BMS-728300. Results: The three ligands selected for development showed high binding affinity (IC50 values, 0.3-8 nM) at CRF1 receptors and moderate lipophilicity (LogD, 2.8-4.4). [H-3]BMS-728300 and the two F-18-labeled ligands showed region-specific binding in rat and rhesus monkey brain autoradiography, namely higher binding density in the frontal and limbic cortex, and cerebellum than in thalamus and brainstem. CRF1 receptor B-max, in rhesus brain was found to be 50-120 fmol/mg protein across cortical regions and cerebellum. PET experiments in rhesus monkey showed that the radioligands [F-18]BMS-721313, [F-18]BMS-732098 and [C-11]BMS-709460 gave acceptably high brain radioactivity uptake but no indication of the specific binding as seen in vitro. Conclusions: Candidate CRF1 receptor PET radioligands were identified but none proved to be effective for imaging monkey brain CRF1 receptors. Higher affinity radioligands are likely required for successful PET imaging of CRF1 receptors. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Thionin-stained sections in different planes showed that this is a subregion of lamina I containing clusters of neurons that appear to have pyramidal or polygonal somata. Extracellular microelectrode recordings in this region revealed clusters of thermoreceptive specific (COLD) cells with nasal or labial receptive fields, whereas nociceptive neurons were found in the adjacent portions of lamina I. Anterograde tracer injections in this region produced trigeminothalamic terminal labeling in the site homologous to the lamina I spino-thalamo-cortical relay nucleus identified previously in the Old World macaque monkey and in humans. Retrograde tracer injections involving this thalamic site, where recordings of trigeminal COLD-like neurons were obtained, produced clusters of retrogradely labeled trigeminothalamic neurons in this immunohistochemically distinct subregion of lamina I, nearly all of which are pyramidal neurons. We conclude that the nocturnal owl monkey has a specialized perinasal thermoreceptive trigeminothalamic sensory pathway that is probably of behavioral significance during olfactory sniffing. In addition, these observations corroborate other findings that have indicated that lamina I COLD cells are pyramidal neurons and are not physiologically modulated by substance P or serotonin, in contrast to nociceptive neurons.

Secondary pathways involving superior colliculus, koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar and their V1-bypassing projections to higher order cortex are known to exist. While they may form an evolutionary old visual system, their contribution to perception and visually guided behaviour remain largely obscure. Recent developments in tract tracing and circuit manipulation technologies provide new insights. Here we discuss how secondary visual pathways mediate residual vision (blindsight) after V1 injury by relaying signals directly into higher order cortical areas. We contrast these findings on blindsight with new studies on dyslexia suggesting that dysfunction of secondary visual pathways might contribute to dyslexic's perceptual difficulties. Emerging from these considerations, secondary visual pathways involving koniocellular LGN may be critical for detection of visual change, whereas pulvinar function appears more linked to visuomotor planning.;"[Rima, Samy] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Schmid, Michael Christoph] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England";"University of Fribourg; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";"Rima, S (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.;Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.";"samy.rima@unifr.ch; michael.schmid@unifr.ch";"RIMA, Samy/HZJ-2821-2023; Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020";"RIMA, Samy/0000-0003-3598-3505; Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X";"ERC [637638]; European Research Council (ERC) [637638] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)";"ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)";This work was supported by ERC starting grant 637638 OptoVision.;;67;6;6;0;3;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;;2468-8673;;CURR OPIN PHYSIOL;Curr.

Herein, using a battery of complementary morphological approaches, including cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and the expression of molecular markers, we pinpoint the features or combination of features that best characterize each nucleus of the pretectothalamic transitional zone of the rat. Our results reveal useful morphological criteria to identify and delineate, with unprecedented precision, several [mostly auditory] nuclei of the posterior group of the thalamus, namely the pretectothalamic lamina (PTL; formerly known as the posterior limitans nucleus), the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGBm), the suprageniculate nucleus (SG), and the ethmoid, posterior triangular and posterior nuclei of the thalamus. The PTL is a sparsely-celled and fiber rich flattened nucleus apposed to the lateral surface of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APT) that marks the border between the pretectum and the thalamus; this structure stains selectively with the Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and is essentially immunonegative for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). The MGBm, located medial to the ventral division of the MGB (MGBv), can be unequivocally identified by the large size of many of its neurons, its dark immunostaining for PV, and its rather selective staining for WFA. The SG, which extends for a considerable caudorostral distance and deviates progressively from the MGB, is characterized by its peculiar cytoarchitecture, the paucity of myelinated fibers, and the conspicuous absence of staining for calretinin (CR); indeed, in many CR-stained sections, the SG stands out as a blank spot. Because most of these nuclei are small and show unique anatomical relationships, the information provided in this article will facilitate the interpretation of the results of experimental manipulations aimed at the auditory thalamus and improve the design of future investigations. Moreover, the previously neglected proximity between the MGBm and the caudal region of the scarcely known PTL raises the possibility that certain features or roles traditionally attributed to the MGBm may actually belong to the PTL.";"[Marquez-Legorreta, Emmanuel; Saldana, Enrique] Univ Salamanca, Neurosci Inst Castilla & Leon INCyL, Salamanca, Spain; [Marquez-Legorreta, Emmanuel; Saldana, Enrique] Univ Salamanca, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Pathol, Salamanca, Spain; [Horta-Junior, Jose de Anchieta C.] UNESP Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Anat, Inst Biosci Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Berrebi, Albert S.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Morgantown, WV USA; [Berrebi, Albert S.] West Virginia Univ, Sensory Neurosci Res Ctr, Morgantown, WV USA; [Saldana, Enrique] Univ Salamanca, Inst Biomed Res Salamanca IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain";"University of Salamanca; University of Salamanca; Universidade Estadual Paulista; West Virginia University; West Virginia University; University of Salamanca";"Saldana, E (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Neurosci Inst Castilla & Leon INCyL, Salamanca, Spain.;Saldana, E (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Pathol, Salamanca, Spain.;Saldana, E (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Inst Biomed Res Salamanca IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.";saldana@usal.es;"Saldaña, Enrique/C-4017-2011; Legorreta, Emmanuel Marquez/S-8003-2018; de Anchieta a c horta-junior, José/C-9553-2013; Horta-Junior, Jose de Anchieta de Castro e/X-7878-2019";"Saldaña, Enrique/0000-0003-1203-1579; Legorreta, Emmanuel Marquez/0000-0001-6729-9404; de Anchieta a c horta-junior, José/0000-0003-3639-9861; Horta-Junior, Jose de Anchieta de Castro e/0000-0003-3639-9861";"Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI10/01803]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BFU2013-43608-P]; Junta de Castilla y Leon [SAN126/SA28/09, SA343U14]; NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [RO1 DC-002266]; CONACyT of Mexico [217039]";"Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Junta de Castilla y Leon(Junta de Castilla y Leon); NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); CONACyT of Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))";This work was supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (grant PI10/01803), Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (grant BFU2013-43608-P), Junta de Castilla y Leon (grants SAN126/SA28/09 and SA343U14) to ES, and by the NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (grant RO1 DC-002266) to ASH.

Thus, auditory cortical processing may be similar to the serial and parallel what and where processing by the primate visual cortex. If where information is serially processed in the primate auditory cortex, neurons in cortical areas along this pathway should have progressively better spatial tuning properties. This prediction is supported by recent experiments that have shown that neurons in the caudomedial field have better spatial tuning properties than neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Neurons in the caudomedial field are also better than primary auditory cortex neurons at predicting the sound localization ability across different stimulus frequencies and bandwidths in both azimuth and elevation. These data support the hypothesis that the primate auditory cortex processes acoustic information in a serial and parallel manner and suggest that this may be a general cortical mechanism for sensory perception.;"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Sect Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Recanzone, GH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;;;;NIDCD NIH HHS [DC-02371] Funding Source: Medline;NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));;;45;101;103;2;6;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Most of these studies were performed with nocturnal animals, particularly mice and rats. In the current study, the PK2 and its receptor, PKR2, was cloned from a species of diurnal macaque monkey. The macaque monkey PK2 and PKR2 were found to be highly homologous to that of other mammalian species. The mRNA expression of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain was examined by in situ hybridization. The expression patterns of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain were found to be quite similar to that of the mouse brain. Particularly, PK2 mRNA was shown to oscillate in the SCN of the macaque brain in the same phase and with similar amplitude with that of nocturnal mouse brain. PKR2 expression was also detected in known primary SCN targets, including the midline thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. In addition, we detected the expression of PKR2 mRNA in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) of both macaque and mouse brains. As a likely SCN to dorsal raphe projection has previously been indicated, the expression of PKR2 in the raphe nuclei of both macaque and mouse brain signifies a possible role of DR as a previously unrecognized primary SCN projection target.;"[Burton, Katherine J.; Li, Xiaohan; Li, Baoan; Cheng, Michelle Y.; Zhou, Qun-Yong] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Urbanski, Henryk F.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR USA";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center";Zhou, QY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.;qzhou@uci.edu;;Cheng, Michelle/0000-0003-3241-5174;NIH [MH67753];NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);The research is supported in part by grants from the NIH (MH67753).;;43;10;11;0;4;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0742-0528;1525-6073;;CHRONOBIOL INT;Chronobiol.

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal. territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities. These fiber morphologies resemble those from the cortex and raise the possibility that VA/VL thalamostriatal projections neurons have divergent connectional features. J. Comp.

Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus.

SUMMARY ANSWER Behavioral, pharmacological and in vivo brain imaging findings indicate that pain can be quantified in macaques with endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is characterized by abdominopelvic hypersensitity. The mechanism by which endometriosis evokes pain is largely unknown, as currently available analgesics offer limited pain relief. Thus, there is a need for both greater understanding of the in vivo mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain and better methods of testing novel therapeutics. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Pain-related behavior and brain activation were assessed in five cynomolgus macaques with endometriosis. Three healthy female macaques served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Abdominopelvic sensitivity to force was assessed with an algometer. Activation of brain areas using block design force stimulation and the effects of a single dose of the analgesic drug morphine and 2-month treatment with the progestin dienogest on brain activation were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Pain response thresholds in macaques with endometriosis were significantly less than that of healthy macaques (P = 0.0003). In addition, non-noxious force activated the insula and thalamus, which was reduced with morphine and 2-month dienogest treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The specific role of cysts, such as peritoneal cysts, in endometriosis pain was not explored. While non-noxious stimulation activated the insula and thalamus, macaques were sedated during fMRI scans. Current findings need further confirmation in a larger cohort. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current study demonstrated central sensitization and related pain behavior in macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis. Altered functioning of the central nervous system could be the focus of future mechanistic studies and for the development of novel therapeutics.

To answer this question, we first located flexible and stable value-coding areas in the caudate head (CDh) and caudate tail (CDt) of two rhesus macaque monkeys, and then injected different retrograde tracers into these areas of each monkey. We found that CDh and CDt received different inputs from several cortical and subcortical areas including temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, claustrum and thalamus. Superior temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex projected to both CDh and CDt, with more CDt-projecting than CDh-projecting neurons. In superior temporal cortex and dorsal inferior temporal cortex, layers 3 and 5 projected to CDh while layers 3 and 6 projected to CDt. Prefrontal and cingulate cortex projected mostly to CDh bilaterally, less to CDt unilaterally. A cluster of neurons in the basolateral amygdala projected to CDt. Rostral-dorsal claustrum projected to CDh while caudal-ventral claustrum projected to CDt. Within the thalamus, different nuclei projected to either CDh or CDt. The medial centromedian nucleus and lateral parafascicular nucleus projected to CDt while the medial parafascicular nucleus projected to CDh. The inferior pulvinar and lateral dorsal nuclei projected to CDt. The ventral anterior and medial dorsal nuclei projected to CDh. We found little evidence of neurons projecting to both CDh and CDt across the brain. These data suggest that CDh and CDt can control separate functions using anatomically separate circuits. Understanding the roles of these striatal projections will be important for understanding how value memories are created and stored.;"[Griggs, Whitney S.; Ghazizadeh, Ali; Costello, M.

Thalamocortical neurons were identified by a spike collision, and exhibited 2 distinct types of task-related activity: 1) a sustained change in activity during the instructed preparation period in response to the instruction cues (set-related activity); and 2) phasic changes in activity during the reaction and movement time periods (movement-related activity). A number of set- and moment-related neurons exhibited direction selectivity. Most movement-related neurons were similarly active, irrespective of the different sensory modalities of the cue for movement. These properties of neuronal activity were similar, regardless of their target cortical motor areas. There were no significant differences in the antidromic latencies of neurons that projected to the primary and nonprimary motor areas. These results suggest that the thalamocortical neurons play an important role in the preparation for, and initiation and execution of, the movements, but are less important than neurons of the nonprimary cortical motor areas in modality-selective sensorimotor transformation. It is likely that such transformations take place within the nonprimary cortical motor areas, but not through thalamocortical information channels.";Hirosaki Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368562, Japan;Hirosaki University;Kurata, K (corresponding author), Hirosaki Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368562, Japan.;kuratak@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp;;;;;;;87;36;38;0;6;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

In guinea pigs, although alternating bilateral jaw movements are usually seen during natural chewing, it is still unclear which cortical areas are responsible for chewing-like RJM. To address this issue, we first defined the cortical areas inducing chewing-like RJM by intracortical microstimulation. Stimulation of the most lateral area of the CMA, the granular cortex, induced chewing-like RJM, but from the region medial to this area, simple vertical RJM were induced. Subsequently, to reveal the properties of these two areas in the CMA, the connections between the CMA and the dorsal thalamus were examined by neuronal tract-tracing techniques. The area inducing chewing-like RJM possessed strong reciprocal connections, mainly with the medial part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, which is the sensory-relay thalamus. On the other hand, the simple vertical RJM-inducing area had reciprocal connections with the motor thalamus. The present study suggests that the CMA inducing chewing-like RJM is different from the CMA inducing simple vertical RJM, and plays a role in cortically induced chewing-like RIM under the influence of the sensory thalamus in guinea pigs.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig, 2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function. Together with the preceding observations of selective STT projections to other thalamic regions, these results provide compelling evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.";Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA;Barrow Neurological Institute;Craig, AD (corresponding author), Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, 350 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.;bcraig@chw.edu;;;;;;;76;21;21;0;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

This unique connectivity suggests that the TRN plays a pivotal role in regulating information flow through the thalamus. Here, we analyzed the roles of TRN neurons in visually guided reaching movements. We first used retrograde transneuronal labeling with rabies virus, and showed that the rostro-dorsal sector of the TRN (TRNrd) projected disynaptically to the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). In other experiments, we recorded neurons from the TRNrd or PMv while monkeys performed a visuomotor task. We found that neurons in the TRNrd and PMv showed visual-, set-, and movement-related activity modulation. These results indicate that the TRNrd, as well as the PMv, is involved in the reception of visual signals and in the preparation and execution of reaching movements. The fraction of neurons that were non-selective for the location of visual signals or the direction of reaching movements was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. Furthermore, the fraction of neurons whose activity increased from the baseline was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. The timing of activity modulation of visualrelated and movement-related neurons was similar in TRNrd and PMv neurons. Overall, our data suggest that TRNrd neurons provide motor thalamic nuclei with inhibitory inputs that are predominantly devoid of spatial selectivity, and that these signals modulate how these nuclei engage in both sensory processing and motor output during visually guided reaching behavior.;"[Saga, Yosuke; Nakayama, Yoshihisa; Yamagata, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Masashi; Hoshi, Eiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Frontal Lobe Funct Project, Tokyo, Japan; [Saga, Yosuke; Tremblay, Leon] CNRS, UMR 5229, Ctr Neurosci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France; [Saga, Yosuke; Nakayama, Yoshihisa; Yamagata, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Masashi; Hoshi, Eiji] Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan; [Takada, Masahiko; Hoshi, Eiji] Japan Agcy Med Res & Dev, AMED CREST, Tokyo, Japan";"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Kyoto University";Saga, Y (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5229, Ctr Neurosci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, 67 Blvd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France.;sagalesvins@gmail.com;"Tremblay, Leon/H-1559-2017; Yamagata, Tomoko/AAQ-9935-2021; Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015";"Tremblay, Leon/0000-0001-8370-6903; Yamagata, Tomoko/0000-0001-7783-1206; Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280; Nakayama, Yoshihisa/0000-0001-9730-3347";"AMED-CREST, AMED; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellow for Research Abroad; Global COE Program of Tamagawa University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16KT0193, 15H01434, 15H05879, 17H05565, 15K21731, 17H06030, 15H01431, 16H02454, 26290012, 16K17369, 15K14316, 16H01611, 15H05871] Funding Source: KAKEN";"AMED-CREST, AMED; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellow for Research Abroad; Global COE Program of Tamagawa University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";The authors thank T.

Young are born after 26-28 days of gestation and do not open their eyes until around 140 days after birth. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin was injected in the visual thalamus in adults and in pouch young aged from 22 days after birth, just after thalamic axons first reach the visual cortex, to 118 days, when cortical lamination resembles the adult. From 22 to 65 days, the developing visual cortex consists of a marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP), and intermediate zone (IZ) including the superficial subplate (SP), subventricular zone, and ventricular zone. There is a thin compact cell zone (CCZ) at the top of the CP and below it a less densely packed region that increases in thickness with age. Retrogradely labelled cells in two bands were first seen at 40 days, one in the CCZ and the other at the base of the CP. Two bands of cells were seen at all subsequent times if the injection covered both LGNd and LP, and by 76 days, these cells were located within cytoarchitectonically recognizable layers V and VI. Anterograde label prior to 45 days was distributed densely and evenly throughout the IZ and the CP up to the CCZ. Label in MZ was first seen at 25 days and was substantial by 54 days. Anterograde label then became gradually reduced in the IZ, whereas in the CP it remained evenly and densely distributed until 82 days. At this age, coincident with the emergence of layer IV, label within the CP first showed variations in density and by 99 days was concentrated over layer IV and, to a lesser extent, over layer VI. By 118 days label resembled the adult after injections covering both LGNd and LP, with label concentrated in layer I, IV, and VI with a less dense projection to lower layer III and upper layer V. There is a relatively earlier initial ingrowth of axons into the visual cortex in the wallaby and throughout development thalamocortical axons appear to be more widely distributed in the depth of the visual cortex than has been demonstrated for placental mammals. They are densely distributed up to the thin CCZ of the CP long before lamination of the cortex emerges beneath this zone. Soon after retrogradely labelled cells are first seen, the two bands of these cells that project to the LGNd and LP and ultimately reside in layers V and VI are also located in the region below the CCZ occupied by thalamocortical afferents. The question arises as to whether there is a waiting period in the SP in the wallaby. If there is not, this may be a genuine difference with placental mammals or a result of the more sensitive technique used here to demonstrate thalamocortical afferents.;AUSTRALIAN NATL UNIV,RES SCH BIOL SCI,DEV NEUROBIOL GRP,POB 475,CANBERRA,ACT 2601,AUSTRALIA;Australian National University;;;;;;;;;43;41;41;0;1;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

To understand the neural mechanism of this transformation process, we examined whether or not the information represented in individual MD neuron's activity changes during a trial of the task. Two monkeys performed two oculomotor delayed-response tasks (an ordinary and a rotatory oculomotor delayed-response task). As MD neurons show directional delay-period activity, we compared the directional selectivity of the same MD neuron between these two tasks and determined whether the activity represented the cue direction or the saccade direction. Among the 26 MD neurons that showed directional delay-period activity, representing information of 27% of neurons gradually altered from the visual domain to the oculomotor domain, while the remaining neurons kept holding either the visual or the oculomotor information throughout the delay period. These results indicate that gradual alteration of information representing in individual MD neurons during the delay period plays an important role in spatial working-memory performance. This alteration could be performed by interactions among MD neurons representing different information during the delay period.;"[Watanabe, Yumiko] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Watanabe, Yumiko; Funahashi, Shintaro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Dept Behav & Cognit Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Funahashi, Shintaro] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Kyoto University; Kyoto University";Funahashi, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 48 Yoshida Shimoadachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;funahashi.shintaro.35e@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp;Watanabe, Yumiko/N-6064-2016;Watanabe, Yumiko/0000-0001-6747-0590;"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21240024, 22220003, 25240021, 24730641, 16K04443]; New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K04443, 24730641] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This study was supported by grants-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science to S.F.

This study aimed to further explore white matter abnormalities in OCD patients through diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and tractography of the two white matter tracts which most probably play an important role in OCD neuropathology: the anterior segment of cingulum bundles (ACB) and the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). Twelve right-handed, medicated adult patients with OCD and 12 matched controls underwent DSI on a 3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Tractography based on DSI data was reconstructed to define the ACB and ATR. Mean generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) was calculated for each targeted tract and was used to analyze local changes in microstructural integrity along individual tracts. There was a significantly lower mean GFA in both the right ATR and left ACB in OCD subjects compared to controls. OCD subjects also demonstrated decreased left-lateralized asymmetry of the ACB when compared to controls. Furthermore, the mean GFA of the left ACB positively correlated with OCD subjects' obsessive subscores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale. This study supports the white matter abnormalities in the ACB and ATR of OCD subjects, which corroborates neurobiological models that posit a defect in fronto-striato-thalamic circuitry in OCD.

The present study was conducted to reveal the projection sites of IL and PL of the monkey. Macaca fuscata, using biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer. IL and PL projected densely to the ventromedial caudate nucleus, the cure and shell of the nucleus accumbens (Acb), parvicellular lateral basal and magnocellular accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala, lateral preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, tubero-mammillary nucleus (TM), medial part of the magnocellular and dorsal part of the parvicellular (MDpc) dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, reunience and medial part of the medial pulvinar nucleus, and dorso-lateral part of the periaqueductal gray (PAGdl) in the mesencephalon. Moderately to weakly projected areas were the intermediate and lateral parts of the agranular insular cortex, orbital part of area 12, agranular and dysgranular part of the temporal pole cortex (TPa-g), auditory temporal cortex, lateral and medial (MS) septal nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. diagonal hand of Broca, substantia innominata, and medial preoptic area, dorsomedial, lateral, and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, magnocellular lateral basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei, paratenial, paraventricular (PV), inter-antero-medial (IAM), reticular, central medial (CeM), parafascicular (PF) and limitans nuclei of the thalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, pedunculo-pontine nucleus. dorsal part of the lateral lemniscal nucleus, ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal raphe, superior central nucleus. medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei (PBI) and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC). A few scattered terminals were observed in the perifornical nucleus of the hypothalamus and substantia nigra pars compacta. PL and area 24 were characterized by projections to the entorhinal (Ent) and piriform (Pir) cortex as well as to the magnocellular part of the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus (VAmc). The morphology of the terminal arborization in each nuclei was different in appearance, perhaps reflecting the synaptic interaction between the nerve terminals and postsynaptic dendrites. PL projected uniquely to Ent. Pir and VAmc and IL projected uniquely to TPa-g, MS, IAM, CeM, MDpc, PF, PBI and LC. IL projected more strongly than PL to the shell of Acb, amygdaloid nuclei, PV, TM, VTA and PAGdl. The present results support the hypothesis that IL is a major cortical autonomic motor area and PL integrates limbic and autonomic inputs in the primate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specific HRP pressure injections to the rostral RNT(1.6-1.8 mm caudal to bregma) resulted in retrograde labelling of neurones in the cerebellar nuclei. The rostral RNT showed specific topographical organization of its cerebellar connections. Microinjections into the rostral RNT, 1.6 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the anterior interposed (emboliform nucleus) and scarce HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei, whereas injections into the rostral RNT, 1.8 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the posterior interposed (globose nucleus) and scarce lightly HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar connections with the rostral RNT were exclusively ipsilateral to the injection site. No HRP-labelled cells were detected in the medial (fastigial nucleus) cerebellar nucleus. The cerebellar connections reach the RNT via the superior cerebellar peduncle. By contrast, HRP injections into the anterior, posterior interposed and lateral cerebellar nuclei produced no labelled cells within the RNT. This study demonstrates the existence of direct cerebello-RNT but not RNT-cerebellar connections. The presence of the cerebello-RNT connections introduces a new route through which the cerebellum may influence RNT and thus cerebral cortical activity.;"Univ Marmara, Sch Med, Dept Anat, TR-81326 Istanbul, Turkey; Univ Marmara, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol & Clin Pharmacol, TR-81326 Istanbul, Turkey";"Marmara University; Marmara University";Cavdar, S (corresponding author), Univ Marmara, Sch Med, Dept Anat, TR-81326 Istanbul, Turkey.;;"Onat, Filiz/U-1468-2019; Çavdar, Safiye/AAH-8585-2019; YANANLI, Hasan Raci/HCH-6215-2022; YANANLI, Hasan/AAB-2578-2021; Gurdal Kosem, Esra/IWE-3205-2023; onat, filiz/A-3653-2016";"Onat, Filiz/0000-0003-0680-4782; YANANLI, Hasan Raci/0000-0003-4649-3632; YANANLI, Hasan/0000-0003-4649-3632; Gurdal Kosem, Esra/0000-0002-6186-6532; onat, filiz/0000-0003-0680-4782; TULAY, CUMHUR MURAT/0000-0001-8593-9233; SEHIRLI, UMIT SULEYMAN/0000-0001-6261-4567; Cavdar, Safiye/0000-0002-8847-9882";;;;;44;21;21;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8782;1469-7580;;J ANAT;J.

Dense global subnetworks of these pathways have often been studied, primarily due to their functional implications. Instead we study sparse local subnetworks of the pathways to establish the role of a brain area in enabling shortest path communication between its non-adjacent topological neighbours. We propose a novel metric to measure the topological communication load on a vertex due to its immediate neighbourhood, and show that in terms of distribution of this local communication load, a network of Macaque long distance pathways is substantially different from other real world networks and random graph models. Macaque network contains the entire range of local subnetworks, from star-like networks to clique-like networks, while other networks tend to contain a relatively small range of subnetworks. Further, sparse local subnetworks in the Macaque network are not only found across topographical super-areas, e.g., lobes, but also within a super-area, arguing that there is conservation of even relatively short-distance pathways. To establish the communication role of a vertex we borrow the concept of brokerage from social science, and present the different types of brokerage roles that brain areas play, highlighting that not only the thalamus, but also cingulate gyrus and insula often act as relays for areas in the neocortex. These and other analysis of communication load and roles of the sparse subnetworks of the Macaque brain provide new insights into the organisation of its pathways.;"[Singh, Raghavendra; Nanavati, Amit A.] IBM Res, Delhi, India; [Nagar, Seema] IBM Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India";;Singh, R (corresponding author), IBM Res, Delhi, India.;raghavsi@in.ibm.com;;;IBM;IBM(International Business Machines (IBM));IBM provided support in the form of salaries for authors RS, SN, AAN, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

The striatum is a target also of crossed corticostriatal (CSt) projections from the contralateral hemisphere, which have been so far somewhat neglected. In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones. The present study is the first detailed description of this anatomic pathway of the macaque brain and provides the substrate for bilateral distribution of motor, motivational, and cognitive signals for reinforcement learning and selection of actions or action sequences, and for learning compensatory motor strategies after cortical stroke.;"[Borra, Elena; Biancheri, Dalila; Rizzo, Marianna; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Med & Chirurg, Unita Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Leonardi, Fabio] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Sci Med Vet, I-43100 Parma, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Parma";Borra, E (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Med & Chirurg, Unita Neurosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;elena.borra@unipr.it;;Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618;"University of Parma; Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) [2017: 2017KZNZLN_002]";"University of Parma; Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN)";This work was supported by the University of Parma and cosponsored by Fondazione Cariparma GrantFondo di Interesse Locale (FIL) 2019-Quota Incentivante (G.L.), Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita edella Ricerca Grant Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) 2017: 2017KZNZLN_002 (E.B.).

Mutations in MCT8 or OATP1C1 result in severe disorders with dramatic movement disability related to alterations in basal ganglia motor circuits. Mapping the expression of MCT8/OATP1C1 in those circuits is necessary to explain their involvement in motor control. We studied the distribution of both transporters in the neuronal subpopulations that configure the direct and indirect basal ganglia motor circuits using immunohistochemistry and double/multiple labeling immunofluorescence for TH transporters and neuronal biomarkers. We found their expression in the medium-sized spiny neurons of the striatum (the receptor neurons of the corticostriatal pathway) and in various types of its local microcircuitry interneurons, including the cholinergic. We also demonstrate the presence of both transporters in projection neurons of intrinsic and output nuclei of the basal ganglia, motor thalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, suggesting an important role of MCT8/OATP1C1 for modulating the motor system. Our findings suggest that a lack of function of these transporters in the basal ganglia circuits would significantly impact motor system modulation, leading to clinically severe movement impairment.;"[Wang, Ting; Wang, Yu; Prensa, Lucia; Rausell, Estrella] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Wang, Ting; Wang, Yu] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Cajal Inst, PhD Program Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Montero-Pedrazuela, Ana; Guadano-Ferraz, Ana] Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Consejo Super Invest Cient CSIC, Inst Invest Biomed Alberto Sols, Madrid 28029, Spain";"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Cajal (IC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols (IIBM)";"Rausell, E (corresponding author), Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Neurosci, Madrid 28029, Spain.;Guadano-Ferraz, A (corresponding author), Autonoma Madrid Univ UAM, Consejo Super Invest Cient CSIC, Inst Invest Biomed Alberto Sols, Madrid 28029, Spain.";"ting.wang02@estudiante.uam.es; yu.wang01@estudiante.uam.es; amontero@iib.uam.es; lucia.prensa@uam.es; ana.guadano.ferraz@csic.es; estrella.rausell@uam.es";"Montero-Pedrazuela, Ana/J-7723-2013; Guadano-Ferraz, Ana/J-7870-2013";"Montero-Pedrazuela, Ana/0000-0003-2308-0894; Guadano-Ferraz, Ana/0000-0002-0666-935X";"MCIN/AEI [SAF2017-86342-R, PID2020-113139RB-I00]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas [2020AEP044]; Sherman Foundation [OTR02211]; Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo [OTR06190]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)";"MCIN/AEI; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas(Spanish Government); Sherman Foundation; Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council)";"This research was funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (Grant No. SAF2017-86342-R to A.G.-F.); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/FEDER Una manera de hacer Europa (Grant No. PID2020-113139RB-I00 to A.G.-F.); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (Grant No. 2020AEP044 to A.G.-F.); the Sherman Foundation (Grant No. OTR02211 to A.G.-F.); Asociacion Corriendo con el Corazon por Hugo (Grant No. OTR06190 to A.G.-F.), Y.W. is a beneficiary of a fellowship from China Scholarship Council (CSC).";;95;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1661-6596;1422-0067;;INT J MOL SCI;Int.

Although the topographic organization of V4's connections with other cortical areas has been established, the detailed topography of its connections with subcortical areas is unclear. We therefore injected retrograde and anterograde tracers in different topographical regions of V4 in nine macaques to determine the organization of its subcortical connections. The injection sites included representations ranging from the fovea to far peripheral eccentricities in both the upper and lower visual fields. The topographically organized connections of V4 included bidirectional connections with four subdivisions of the pulvinar, two subdivisions of the claustrum, and the interlaminar portions of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and efferent projections to the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and the caudate nucleus. All of these structures have a possible role in spatial attention. The nontopographic, or converging, connections included bidirectional connections with the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, afferent inputs from the dorsal raphe, median raphe, locus coeruleus, ventral tegmentum and nucleus basalis of Meynert, and efferent projections to the putamen. Any role of these structures in attention may be less spatially specific. J. Comp. Neurol. 522:1941-1965, 2014.

Thalamic neurons that receive synaptic input from the globus pallidus or the cerebellar nuclei were identified in awake monkeys trained to perform an arm-reaching task. The location of electrophysiologically identified cerebellar-receiving (CR) and pallidal-receiving (PR) neurons was used to identify a total of 264 thalamic neurons in cerebellar (CB) or pallidal (GP) regions of the thalamus. 2. Stimulation in the brachium conjunctivum or white matter adjacent to the cerebellar nuclei excited 85 neurons in the thalamus at short latencies. These CR neurons were located in the oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), in caudal portions of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), and in area X. 3. Stimulation in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) inhibited 10 thalamic neurons at short latency. These PR neurons were located in rostral portions of VLc, in the oral part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo), and in the parvicellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). 4. There was no clear single somatotopic organization of neurons in CB and GP regions of the thalamus, as defined by free-form responses to passive manipulation and observation of eye movements. There was, in fact, a tendency for two representations, each, of the head/eye/mouth cells and cells with modifications of activity in response to manipulation of the arm. 5. During the hold period before illumination of a visual target, the mean firing rates and variability of discharge of arm-related CR and PR neurons did not differ significantly. This was also true for the total sample of arm-related neurons in the CB versus GP regions. 6. The activity of many neurons in both the CB and GP regions began to change before the reaching movement and, for some, before the earliest recorded changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity. The initial change was an increase in discharge for > 75% of the cells studied in both the CB and GP regions. 7. During the reaching task, there also was no significant difference in the time of the initial change in discharge of neurons in the CB versus GP regions of the thalamus. 8. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial task-related change in discharge of PR thalamic neurons is dominated by input from the cerebral cortex and that pallidal input modulates later phases of their movement-related changes in activity.;"UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH MED,DEPT REHABIL MED,SEATTLE,WA 98195; UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH MED,REG PRIMATE RES CTR,SEATTLE,WA 98195";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";ANDERSON, ME (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL & BIOPHYS,SJ-40,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.;;Turner, Robert S/A-9695-2008;Turner, Robert S/0000-0002-6074-4365;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00166] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM-07108] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-15017] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;72;99;102;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Dense projections arose from pyramidal cells in layer III of the subiculum and prosubiculum, and terminated in the medial mammillary nucleus. While there was no evidence of an input from the dentate gyrus or fields CA1-3, a small contribution arose from the presubiculum and entorhinal cortices. All of the hippocampal and parahippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies appeared to use the fornix as a route. The caudal portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum contained the greatest numbers of cells projecting to the mammillary bodies. A light contralateral projection to the medial mammillary nucleus was also observed, although this appeared to arise primarily from the more rostral portions of the subiculum and prosubiculum. There was a crude topography within the medial mammillary nucleus, with the caudal subicular projections terminating in the mid and dorsal portions of the nucleus while the rostral subicular and entorhinal projections terminated in the ventral and lateral portions of the medial nucleus. Light ipsilateral projections throughout the lateral mammillary nucleus were sometimes observed. Comparisons with related studies of the macaque brain showed that the dense hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies arise from a population of subicular cells separate from those that project to the anterior thalamic nuclei, even though the major output from the mammillary bodies is to the anterior thalamic nuclei. Other comparisons revealed underlying similarities with the corresponding projections in the rat brain.;"Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Tower Bldg,Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.;aggleton@cf.ac.uk;Vann, Seralynne D/A-1601-2010;"Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308; Vann, Seralynne/0000-0002-6709-8773";;;;;51;67;67;0;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Accordingly, we used in vitro slices from which to record and labeled cells in the middle layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices to compare basic anatomical and physiological features of cells recovered in similar layers using the same methods. Our results demonstrate a striking difference in a basic characteristic of two primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual cortex, spiny stellate cells predominate, receive short-latency synaptic inputs, and project to supergranular layers. No such spiny stellate population is encountered in the middle layers of the auditory cortex. Spiny cells that are not stellate or pyramidal are occasionally encountered but, as a group, do not display consistent anatomical or physiological features that might allow them to function as auditory cortical versions of the visual spiny stellates. Rather, pyramidal cells in the lower half of layer 3 and layer 4 appear to have assumed this role. J. Comp. Neurol. 436:508-519, 2001.

In three experiments using blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural substrates of acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in which certain sounds can produce an intense somatosensory tingling sensation in a patient with a thalamic lesion. Compared with nine normal controls, the first experiment showed that the patient had a threefold greater BOLD response to sounds in the parietal operculum, the location of secondary somatosensory cortex. We hypothesized that this abnormal opercular activity might be the neural substrate of the patient's synesthesia. Supporting this hypothesis, the second experiment demonstrated that sounds that produced no somatosensation did not evoke a BOLD response in the operculum, while sounds that produced strong somatosensations evoked large BOLD responses. These abnormal responses may have resulted from plasticity induced by the loss of somatosensory inputs. Consistent with this idea, in the third experiment, BOLD responses to somatosensory stimulation were significantly weaker in the patient's operculum than in normal controls. These experiments demonstrate a double dissociation in the patient's secondary somatosensory cortex (increased responses to auditory stimulation and decreased responses to somatosensory stimulation), and suggest both that stroke-induced plasticity can result in abnormal connections between sensory modalities that are normally separate, and that synesthesia can be caused by inappropriate connections between nearby cortical territories.;"[Beauchamp, Michael S.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ro, Tony] CUNY City Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Ro, Tony] CUNY City Coll, Program Congnit Neurosci, New York, NY 10031 USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY)";Beauchamp, MS (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 6431 Fannin St,Suite G-550, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;"Michael.S.Beauchamp@uth.tmc.edu; tro@ccny.cuny.edu";Beauchamp, Michael/AAK-9813-2020;Beauchamp, Michael/0000-0002-7599-9934;;;;;39;46;47;0;10;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Angiotensin IV binds to a high affinity site that is quite distinct in pharmacology and distribution from the angiotensin II AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and is known as the AT(4) receptor. These observations suggest that the AT(4) receptor may have multiple central effects. The present study uses in vitro receptor autoradiography, and employs [I-125]angiotensin IV to map AT(4) receptors in the macaca fascicularis brain. The distribution of the AT(4) receptor is remarkable in that its distribution extends throughout several neural systems. Most striking is its localization in motor nuclei and motor associated regions. These include the ventral horn spinal motor neurons, all cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor, abducens, facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Receptors are also present in the vestibular, reticular and inferior olivary nuclei, the granular layer of the cerebellum, and the Betz cells of the motor cortex. Moderate AT(4) receptor density is seen in all cerebellar nuclei, ventral thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta, with lower receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Abundant AT(4) receptors are also found in areas associated with cholinergic nuclei and their projections, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus, somatic motor nuclei and autonomic preganglionic motor nuclei. AT(4) receptors are also observed in sensory regions, with moderate levels in spinal trigeminal, gracile, cuneate and thalamic ventral posterior nuclei, and the somatosensory cortex. The abundance of the AT(4) receptor in motor and cholinergic neurons, and to a lesser extent, in sensory neurons, suggests multiple roles for the AT(4) receptor in the primate brain.;UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PSYCHOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA;University of New South Wales Sydney;Moeller, I (corresponding author), UNIV MELBOURNE,DEPT MED,AUSTIN & REPATRIAT MED CTR,AUSTIN CAMPUS,HEIDELBERG,VIC 3084,AUSTRALIA.;;Paxinos, George/E-1840-2012;Paxinos, George/0000-0001-8695-7951;;;;;27;61;61;0;0;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;MAR 18;1996;712;2;;;;;307;324;;10.1016/0006-8993(95)01482-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(95)01482-9;;;18;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;UD435;8814907;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1996UD43500017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Limits in the extent of change have been attributed to limited divergence in the thalamocortical projection. However, studies have commonly been restricted to animals surviving less than a year following relatively modest peripheral sensory perturbations. After extensive deafferentation and longterm survival, more extensive changes, seemingly beyond the limits of thalamocortical divergence, have been reported. We report changes in the somatotopic map in area 3b of an adult macaque monkey, in which part of the index finger of one hand had been amputated two years previously. The representation of the remaining stump occupied the whole region of area 3b normally devoted to the representation of the entire digit. The skin surrounding the stump appeared to have been hyperinnervated by axons severed during the amputation. The hyperinnervation of remaining skin may have reactivated neurons of the somatosensory system silenced by the amputation, leading to the recovery of a cortical map but with a modified organization.;UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, IRVINE, CA 92717 USA;"University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;;;;;;;19;44;44;0;2;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8452;;;P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI;Proc.

To this end, we derive a unique network incorporating 410 anatomical tracing studies of the macaque brain from the Collation of Connectivity data on the Macaque brain (CoCoMac) neuroinformatic database. Our network consists of 383 hierarchically organized regions spanning cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia; models the presence of 6,602 directed long-distance connections; is three times larger than any previously derived brain network; and contains subnetworks corresponding to classic corticocortical, corticosubcortical, and subcortico-subcortical fiber systems. We found that the empirical degree distribution of the network is consistent with the hypothesis of the maximum entropy exponential distribution and discovered two remarkable bridges between the brain's structure and function via network-theoretical analysis. First, prefrontal cortex contains a disproportionate share of topologically central regions. Second, there exists a tightly integrated core circuit, spanning parts of premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, insula, and visual cortex, that includes much of the task-positive and task-negative networks and might play a special role in higher cognition and consciousness.";"[Modha, Dharmendra S.] IBM Res Almaden, San Jose, CA 95120 USA; [Singh, Raghavendra] IBM Res India, New Delhi 110070, India";"International Business Machines (IBM); International Business Machines (IBM)";Modha, DS (corresponding author), IBM Res Almaden, San Jose, CA 95120 USA.;dmodha@us.ibm.com;;;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Sciences Office [HR0011-09-C-0002];Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Defense Sciences Office(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA));We thank four anonymous reviewers for a number of constructive suggestions that greatly improved and expanded our original submission.

The results indicated that ventral precallosal and subcallosal areas 14 and 25, and the ventral, subcallosal parr of area 32, all receive projections from the mediodorsal portion of the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDmc). The dorsal, precallosal part of area 32 receives projections mainly from the dorsal portion of the parvocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDpc), which also provides some input to area 14. Polar area 10 receives input from both MDpc and the densocellular division of the medial dorsal nucleus (MDdc), as does supracallosal area 24. Area 24 receives additional input from the anterior medial nucleus and midline nuclei. All medial prefrontal cortical areas were also found to receive projections from a number of cortical regions within the temporal lobe, such as the temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Areas 24, 25, and 32 receive, in addition, input from the entorhinal cortex. Combining these results with prior anatomical and behavioral data, we conclude that medial temporal areas that are important for object recognition memory send information directly both to dorsal medial prefrontal areas 24 and 32 and to ventral medial prefrontal areas 14 and 25. Only the latter two areas have additional access to this information via projections from the mediodorsal part of MDmc.;NIMH, NEUROPSYCHOL LAB, BETHESDA, MD 20892 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";;;MEUNIER, Martine/C-2611-2015;MEUNIER, Martine/0000-0002-9380-9372;;;;;63;70;70;0;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Damage to the medial, magnocellular part of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impairs cognitive functions dependent on prefrontal cortex, including memory. The contribution of MDmc to other aspects of cognition dependent on prefrontal cortex has not been determined. The ability of monkeys to adjust their choice behavior in response to changes in reinforcer value, a capacity impaired by lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, can be tested in a reinforcer devaluation paradigm. In the present study, rhesus monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic MDmc lesions were tested in the devaluation procedure. Monkeys learned visual discrimination problems in which each rewarded object is reliably paired with one of two different food rewards and then were given choices between pairs of rewarded objects, one associated with each food. Selective satiation of one of the food rewards reduces choices of objects associated with that food in normal monkeys. Monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of MDmc learned concurrently presented visual discrimination problems as quickly as unoperated control monkeys but showed impaired reinforcer devaluation effects. This finding suggests that the neural circuitry for control of behavioral choice by changes in reinforcer value includes MDmc.;Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Pathol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England;University of Oxford;Mitchell, AS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Pathol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England.;;"Mitchell, Anna S/Q-1196-2019; Browning, Philip G/M-8917-2015";"Mitchell, Anna S/0000-0001-8996-1067; Browning, Philip G/0000-0002-8327-2946";Wellcome Trust [071291] Funding Source: Medline;Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);;;39;80;80;0;6;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The relation of the resulting patterns of transported label to the cytoarchitecture and cytochrome oxidase architecture of the thalamus lead to three major conclusions. 1) The region traditionally described as the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) is a composite of VP proper and parts of the ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPi). Much of the VP region consists of groups of densely stained, closely packed neurons that project to S-I. VPi includes a ventral oval of pale, less densely packed neurons and finger-like protrusions that extend into VP proper and separate clusters of VP neurons related to different body parts. Neurons in both parts of VPi project to S-II rather than S-I. Connection patterns indicate that the proper and the embedded parts of VPi combine to form a body representation paralleling that in VP. 2) VPi also provides the major thalamic input into PV. 3) In architecture, location, and cortical connections, the region traditionally described as the anterior pulvinar (AP) of monkeys resembles the medial posterior nucleus, Pom, of other mammals and we propose that all or most of AP is homologous to Pom. AP caps VP dorsomedially, has neurons that are moderately dense in Nissl staining, and reacts moderately in CO preparations.

To investigate the development of a major afferent input to the cortex, we studied the formation of thalamocortical connections in an organotypic culture system. Slices from the lateral thalamus of young rats were cocultured with slices from the visual cortex. Thalamocortical projections in vitro were examined anatomically with fluorescent dyes and physiologically with electrophysiological and optical recording techniques. Axons emerged from thalamic explants radially in all directions. The outgrowth of thalamic fibers and the course of the axonal trajectories were not influenced by the presence of the cocultured cortex. Only those thalamic axons that happened to grow toward the cortical slices invaded their target tissue. Thalamocortical projection cell in vitro had the characteristic morphology of thalamic relay neurons. Cells with the morphology of interneurons were present in thalamic explants, but these neurons did not project to the cocultured cortex. Thalamocortical axons in vitro terminated in their appropriate cortical target layer, formed axonal arbors, and made functional synaptic contacts. Such specific connections between thalamic neurons and their cortical target cells were established regardless of whether thalamocortical axons invaded the cortex from the white matter side or from the pial surface. These results suggest that thalamic projection neurons have an innate mechanism that allows them to recognize their cortical target cells. Thus, intrinsic factors play a significant role in the laminar specification of cortical connections during development.;MAX PLANCK INST BIOL CYBERNET,W-7400 TUBINGEN,GERMANY;Max Planck Society;BOLZ, J (corresponding author), MAX PLANCK GESELL,FRIEDRICH MIESCHER LAB,SPEMANNSTR 37-39,W-7400 TUBINGEN,GERMANY.;;;;;;;;85;141;145;0;4;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

This work assesses the in vivo binding and imaging characteristics of [F-18]nifene in rhesus monkeys for the development of PET experiments examining nAChR binding. Methods: Dynamic PET imaging experiments with [F-18]nifene were acquired in four anesthetized Macaca mulatta (rhesus) monkeys using a microPET P4 scanner. Data acquisition was initiated with a bolus injection of 109 +/- 17 MBq [F-18] nifene and the time course of the radioligand in the brain was measured for up to 120 min. For two experiments, a displacement dose of (-)nicotine (0.03 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was given 45-60 min post injection and followed 30 min later with a second [F-18]nifene injection to measure radioligand nondisplaceable uptake. Time activity curves were extracted in the regions of the antereoventral thalamus (AVT), lateral geniculate nucleus region (LGN), frontal cortex, and the cerebellum (CB). Results: The highest levels of [F-18]nifene uptake were observed in the AVT and LGN. Target-to-CB ratios reached maximum values of 3.3 +/- 0.4 in the AVT and 3.2 +/- 0.3 in the LGN 30-45 min postinjection. Significant binding of [F-18]nifene was observed in the subiculum, insula cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain areas. The (-)nicotine displaced bound [F-18]nifene to near background levels within 15 min postdrug injection. No discernable displacement was observed in the CB, suggesting its potential as a reference region. Logan graphical estimates using the CB as a reference region yielded binding potentials of 1.6 +/- 0.2 in the AVT and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in the LGN. The postnicotine injection displayed uniform nondisplaceable uptake of [F-18]nifene throughout gray and white brain matter. Conclusions: [F-18]Nifene exhibits rapid equilibration and a moderately high target to background binding profile in the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR rich regions of the brain, thus providing favorable imaging characteristics as a PET radiotracer for nAChR assay.

Both LIP and 7a received the majority of their thalamic input from contiguous but distinct zones within the medial pulvinar nucleus. Thalamocortical cell bodies that projected to LIP were arranged in a dense, horizontally oriented cluster that was sandwiched between two similar clusters of neurons that projected to 7a. There was minimal overlap of the respective clusters. LIP also received an appreciable input from the dorsal half of the lateral pulvinar nucleus, but tracer placements in 7a resulted in only occasional labeled neurons in the lateral pulvinar.;"UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT ANAT, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA; UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT PHYS THERAPY, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA; UNIV MISSISSIPPI, MED CTR, DEPT OPHTHALMOL, JACKSON, MS 39216 USA";"University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center";;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY04159] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;95;46;46;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

However, the functional roles of this complex remain to be fully elucidated. Here we have examined whether the CM-Pf complex is involved in the process of covert attention. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a task in which a visual target stimulus for button release appeared at either the same location as the preceding visual instruction cue (a validly cued target) or a location on the opposite side (an invalidly cued target). Reaction times (RTs) to a validly cued target were significantly shorter than those to an invalidly cued target, leading to a validity effect of about 20 ms. We recorded the activity of 97 neurons in the CM-Pf while the monkeys performed the attention task with the hand that was contralateral to the neuronal recording. Seventy CM-Pf neurons showed task-related activity after the appearance of either the instruction cue or the target stimulus: 33 neurons responded with a prominent short-latency facilitation (SLF), whereas 37 responded with a short-latency suppression followed by a long-latency facilitation (LLF). Most of the SLF neurons responded preferentially to a cue appearing on the contralateral side (76%) and to an invalidly cued target appearing on the contralateral side (61%). In contrast, LLF neurons showed a short-latency suppression after the cue stimulus, regardless of whether the cue appeared on the contra- or ipsilateral side (84%). Inactivating the CM-Pf complex by local injection (1 mul) of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1-5 mug/mul) resulted in a significant increase in the RT to a validly cued target presented on the contra- but not the ipsilateral side. In contrast, inactivating the CM-Pf complex did not affect RTs to invalidly cued targets on either the contra- or the ipsilateral side. Thus the validity effect was abolished only on the contralateral side. We conclude that the CM-Pf complex plays a specific and essential role in the process of attentional orienting to external events occurring on the contralateral side, probably through the projection of primary outputs to the striatum, which is involved in the action-selection mechanisms of the basal ganglia.;Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine;Kimura, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.;mkimura@basic.kpu-m.ac.jp;"Minamimoto, Takafumi/D-6610-2012; Minamimoto, Takafumi/AAD-8726-2020";"Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174";;;;;59;135;139;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The visual system of macaque has been extensively characterized both anatomically and functionally. We have taken advantage of this to examine the influence of congenital blindness in a macaque model of developmental anophthalmia. Developmental anophthalmia in macaque effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Here we show that retrograde tracers injected in early visual areas, including HC, reveal a drastic reduction of cortical projections of the reduced lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, there is an important expansion of projections from the pulvinar complex to the HC, compared to the controls. These findings show that the functional consequences of congenital blindness need to be considered in terms of both modifications of the interareal cortical network and the ascending visual pathways.;"[Magrou, Loic; Giroud, Pascale; Berland, Michel; Knoblauch, Kenneth; Dehay, Colette; Kennedy, Henry] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst,U1208, F-69500 Bron, France; [Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Barone, Pascal] CNRS, UMR 5549, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31059 Toulouse, France; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Markov, Nikola T.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Scheeren, Gwylan] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurosci, Swammerdam Inst Life Sci, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Killackey, Herbert P.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Kennedy, Henry] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China";"Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Amsterdam; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Chinese Academy of Sciences";"Dehay, C; Kennedy, H (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst,U1208, F-69500 Bron, France.";"colette.dehay@inserm.fr; henry.kennedy@inserm.fr";"Kennedy, Henry/B-9636-2013; Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009; Dehay, Colette/H-4437-2014; Knoblauch, Kenneth/H-8156-2014; Markov, Nikola T./AFO-2802-2022";"Kennedy, Henry/0000-0002-2796-7663; Barone, Pascal/0000-0003-0125-7468; Dehay, Colette/0000-0002-5196-1464; Knoblauch, Kenneth/0000-0002-4681-4638; Markov, Nikola T./0000-0003-1417-1161";"LABEX CORTEX [ANR-11-LABX-0042]; Universite de Lyon [ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; CORE-NETS [ANR-11-BSV4-501]; ARCHI-CORE [ANR-14-CE13-0033]; CORNET [ANR-15-CE32-0016]; PRIMACOR [ANR-14-CE13-0036]; FRM Equipe [DEQ20160334943]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-15-CE32-0016, ANR-14-CE13-0033, ANR-14-CE13-0036] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)";"LABEX CORTEX; Universite de Lyon; CORE-NETS; ARCHI-CORE; CORNET; PRIMACOR; FRM Equipe; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";"LABEX CORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042 to H.K.), Universite de Lyon (ANR-11-IDEX-0007 to H.K.), CORE-NETS (ANR-11-BSV4-501 to H.K.), ARCHI-CORE (ANR-14-CE13-0033 to H.K.), CORNET (ANR15-CE32-0016 to H.K.), PRIMACOR (ANR-14-CE13-0036; all operated by the French National Research Agency [ANR]), and FRM Equipe (DEQ20160334943; operated by the Foundation for Medical Research).";;87;1;1;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

However, recent findings suggest that behavioral patterns can be delineated on the basis of the four main arterial thalamic territories. The anterior pattern consists mainly of perseverations and superimposition of unrelated information, apathy, and amnesia. After paramedian infarct, the most frequent features are disinhibition syndromes, with personality changes, loss of self-activation, amnesia, and, in the case of extensive lesions, thalamic dementia; this pattern may often be difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially when neurologic dysfunction is lacking. After inferolateral lesion, executive dysfunction may develop but is often overlooked, although it may occasionally lead to severe long-term disability. After posterior lesion, whereas cognitive dysfunction with neglect and aphasia are well known, no specific behavioral syndrome has been reported.

High concentration of isoflurane resulted in global CBF increase and blood pressure decrease. Evident CBF change was observed in the subcortical structures. Specifically, CBF in thalamus and cerebellum was increased about 39% and 55% when isoflurane concentration was changed from 0.75% to 1.5%, respectively. Also, those regional CBF changes correlated linearly with isoflurane inspiratory concentrations, indicating impaired CBF autoregulation in these structures. In contrast, no obvious CBF changes were observed in anterior cingulated cortex, motor cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and caudate. The results demonstrate that, under the 0.75-1.5% isoflurane maintenance doses, the CBF auto-regulation is well preserved in the cerebral cortical regions and caudate, but impaired in thalamus and cerebellum, indicating disturbed CBF-metabolism coupling and functional response in specific subcortical regions of anesthetized macaque monkeys.

The present experiments use both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques to characterize the connections of Rgb. The main cortical projections from Rgb are to the caudal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, area 18b, retrosplenial granular a cortex (Rga), and postsubiculum, and less dense terminal fields are present in the prelimbic and caudal occipital cortices. The major subcortical projections are to the anterior thalamic nuclei and the rostral pontine nuclei, and very small terminal fields are present in the caudal dorsomedial part of the striatum, the reuniens and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, and the mammillary bodies. Contralaterally, Rgb primarily projects to itself, i.e., hornotypically, and more sparsely projects to Rga and postsubiculum. In general, the axons from Rgb terminate ipsilaterally in cortical layers I and III-V and contralaterally in layer V, with a smaller number of terminals in layers I and VI. Thalamic projections from Rgb target the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, with only a few axons terminating in the anterodorsal nucleus, the reticular nucleus, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. Rgb is innervated by the anterior cingulate cortex, precentral agranular cortex, cortical area 18b, dorsal subiculum, and postsubiculum. Subcortical projections to Rgb originate mainly in the claustrum, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These data demonstrate that, in the rat, Rgb is a major nodal point for the integration and subsequent distribution of information to and from the hippocampal formation, the midline limbic and visual cortices, and the thalamus. Thus, similarly to the entorhinal cortex, Rgb in the rat is a prominent gateway for information exchange between the hippocampal formation and other limbic areas of the brain.;"Univ Alabama, Dept Cell Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; Univ Kuopio, Dept Neurol & Neurosci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Kuopio Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland";"University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Eastern Finland; Kuopio University Hospital";Wyss, JM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Cell Biol, 1900 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.;;van Groen, Thomas/A-3150-2008;Wyss, J Michael/0000-0003-1094-2934;NINDS NIH HHS [NS 41071] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;80;224;227;0;18;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012 USA;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Single anatomical criteria, such as cytoarchitecture, connectivity with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus or a dopaminergic innervation, are insufficient to unequivocally define the PFC. It is argued that, with respect to a number of structural aspects, the prefrontal and the (pre)motor cortical areas must be viewed as a continuum, whereas a (functional) differentiation is based on the type of information that is being processed in different parts of the frontal lobe. The involvement of the PFC, like the premotor cortex, in a number of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits may be interpreted in the same way. The paper also summarizes the organization of the inputs from midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the basal amygdaloid complex and the hippocampus into the PFC-ventral striatal system. The results of tracing studies in rats indicate that these thalamic and limbic inputs both at the level of the PFC and the ventral striatum show various patterns of convergence and segregation. This leads to the conclusion that the PFC-ventral striatal system consists of a number of smaller modules.;INST BRAIN RES, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;;Groenewegen, HJ (corresponding author), FREE UNIV AMSTERDAM, FAC MED, DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL, RES SCH NEUROSCI AMSTERDAM, NL-1081 BT AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;;;;;;;;86;192;197;1;21;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0269-8811;1461-7285;;J PSYCHOPHARMACOL;J.

Cortical origins of the corticospinal projections were examined by constructing planar projection maps of the distributions of labeled corticospinal neuron somas; these somas were found only in lamina V. At birth elaborate somatotopically organized corticospinal projections from primary motor cortex (area 4), the mesial supplementary motor area and cingulate areas 23 and 24, area 12, dorsolateral area 6a beta, the dorsolateral and ventral area 6a alpha (area F4), parietal areas 2/5, 7b and the peri-insular cortex (including area SII), were clearly defined, with axons extending to all spinal cord segments. While this pattern of regional projections broadly resembled that of the mature macaque, there were, however, substantial maturational changes during the 8 months after birth, These included (1) a halving of the area of cerebral cortex from which the contralateral corticospinal projection originated and (2) a threefold reduction in the number of labeled corticospinal neurons projecting to all segments of the cord. Collateral elimination rather than neuronal cell death was the likely mechanism for this reduction in the population and areal extent of corticospinal neurons in the maturing macaque. The surviving corticospinal axon terminals also developed substantially during the postnatal period, At birth some terminals had invaded the intermediate zone in each spinal segment, hut few had penetrated the dorsal and ventral horns. By 6 postnatal months, however, many corticospinal neurons were retrogradely labeled following the injection of fluorescent labels into each of these spinal zones in cervical and lumbar spinal segments. These data demonstrate a considerable postnatal reduction in corticospinal neurons projecting to the contralateral spinal cord, and imply that many of the axons that are eliminated never synapse on spinal neurons. It is suggested that during the middle fetal period the axons of many of the cortical neurons in lamina V that in the mature monkey will terminate on particular neuron populations in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord, traverse a common pathway down through the internal capsule into the spinal cord, passing close to these successive targets, and possibly forming collaterals at these levels. In the postnatal period each such neuron establishes a stable, effective synaptic input to only one or a few of these subcortical target populations, and the remaining collateral branches regress, The postnatal maturation of corticospinal neurons, examined in this study, is compatible with such a model.";UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, BRAIN RES LAB, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA;University of Melbourne;GALEA, MP (corresponding author), UNIV MELBOURNE, HOWARD FLOREY INST EXPTL PHYSIOL & MED, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA.;;Galea, Mary/F-4242-2010;Galea, Mary/0000-0003-0045-7978;;;;;78;74;74;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

A comprehensive transcriptomic and open chromatin atlas of the rhesus macaque brain is key to a deeper understanding of the brain. Here we characterize the transcriptome of 416 brain samples from 52 regions of 8 rhesus macaque brains. We identify gene modules associated with specific brain regions like the cerebral cortex, pituitary, and thalamus. In addition, we discover 9703 novel intergenic transcripts, including 1701 coding transcripts and 2845 lncRNAs. Most of the novel transcripts are only expressed in specific brain regions or cortical regions of specific individuals. We further survey the open chromatin regions in the hippocampal CA1 and several cerebral cortical regions of the rhesus macaque brain using ATAC-seq, revealing CA1- and cortex-specific open chromatin regions.

In this study, the organization of these projections was defined in relation to architectonic areas within the OMPFC. All of the limbic structures were substantially connected with the following posterior and medial orbital areas: the posteromedial, medial, intermediate, and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm, Iam, Iai, and Ial, respectively) and areas 11m, 13a, 13b, 14c, and 14r. In contrast, lateral orbital areas 12o, 12m, and 12l and medial wall areas 24a,b and 32 were primarily connected with the amygdala, the temporal pole, and the cingulate cortex. Data were not obtained on the posteroventral medial wall. Three distinct projections were recognized from the basal amygdaloid nucleus: 1) The dorsal part projected to area 121; 2) the ventromedial part projected to most areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex except for areas Iai, 12o, 13a, and 14c; and 3) the ventrolateral part projected to orbital areas 120, Iai, 13a, 14c, and to the medial wall areas. The accessory basal and lateral amygdaloid nuclei projected most strongly to areas in the posterior and medial orbital cortex. The medial, anterior cortical, and central amygdaloid nuclei and the periamygdaloid cortex were connected with the posterior orbital areas. The projection from the hippocampus originated from the rostral subiculum and terminated in the medial orbital areas. The same region was reciprocally connected with the anteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, which received input from the rostral subiculum. The parahippocampal cortical areas (including the temporal polar, entorhinal, perirhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices) were primarily connected with posterior and medial orbital areas, with some projections to the dorsal part of the medial wall. The rostral cingulate cortex sent fibers to the medial wall, to the medial orbital areas, and to lateral areas 12o, 12r, and Iai. The posterior cingulate gyrus, including the caudomedial lobule, was especially strongly connected with area 11m.

Following tritiated amino acid injections into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and WGA-HRP injections into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei, we found that the nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic afferents distribute to three main targets: the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the internal medullary lamina (IML) region, which includes the paralaminar VA, the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the central lateral nucleus (CL), and finally the ventromedial nucleus (VM). We observed three distribution patterns of labeled fibers: a) Dense single label was observed in the central portion of VA following the SNr injections and in VL following the cerebellar nuclei injections. b) A complementary pattern consisting of alternating foci of nigral and cerebellar label was found in the IML region. This pattern was also observed in the caudal intralaminar nuclei where cerebellar label predominated in the centrum medianum (CM), while the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) primarily contained nigral label. c) An overlapping pattern of autoradiographic and WGA-HRP label was found in the lateral half of the VM. Overall, the distribution of nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections was widespread throughout much of rostrocaudal thalamus. However, the pattern of projections varied along a continuum from lateral to medial thalamus. In lateral thalamus, nigral and cerebellar projections distributed to separate nuclei while in medial thalamus, the projection pattern changed to focal and complementary in the IML and overlapping in VM. Taken together, these thalamic projections may constitute crucial links in different functional channels involved in alerting and orienting mechanisms associated with motor behavior. Our findings also suggest that the organization of motor thalamic afferents in the dog shares similarities with the segregated and parallel circuitry characteristic of primates as well as with the overlapping and converging circuits of rodents and other carnivores.;;;SAKAI, ST (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,COLL HUMAN MED,DEPT ANAT,E LANSING,MI 48824, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NSRO1-18551] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;58;23;23;0;2;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations. The differential laminar distributions of neurons projecting to the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus suggest that these structures may receive independent types of information from the prefrontal cortex.;"EDITH NOURSE ROGERS MEM VET ADM HOSP, BEDFORD, MA 01730 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; BETH ISRAEL HOSP, HARVARD NEUROL UNIT, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center";YETERIAN, EH (corresponding author), COLBY COLL, DEPT PSYCHOL, WATERVILLE, ME 04901 USA.;;;;PHS HHS [16841] Funding Source: Medline;PHS HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service);;;93;48;48;0;1;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Anatomical and physiological results were later related to histological distinctions in the same brains after sections were processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), or cytochrome oxidase (CO). The experiments produced several major findings. (1) Neurons throughout a broad expanse of cortex were highly responsive to pure tones, and best frequencies could be determined for neurons in arrays of recording sites. (2) The microelectrode recordings revealed two systematic representations of tone frequencies, the primary area (AI) and a primary-like rostral field (R) as previously described. The representation of high to low frequency tones in A1 was largely caudorostral along the plane of the sulcus. A reversal of the order of representation of frequencies occurred in R. (3) AI and R together were coextensive with a koniocellular, densely myelinated zone that expressed high levels of AchE and CO. These architectonic features were somewhat less pronounced in R than AI, but a clear border between the two areas was not apparent. (4) Cortex bordering AI and R was less responsive to tones, but when best frequencies for neurons could be determined, they matched those for adjoining parts of AI and R. (5) Architectonically distinct regions were apparent within some of the cortex bordering AI and R. (6) The major ipsilateral cortical connections of AI were with R and cortex immediately lateral and medial to AI. (7) Callosal connections of AI were predominately with matched locations in the opposite AI, but they also included adjoining fields. (8) Neurons in the ventral (MG(V)), medial (MG(M)), and dorsal (MG(D)) nuclei of the medial geniculate complex projected to AI and cortex lateral to AI. (9) Injections in cortex responsive to high frequency tones labeled more dorsal parts of MG(V) than injections in cortex responsive to low frequency tones.

Previous PET S1R radiotracers are characterized by slow kinetics or off-target binding that impedes their use in humans. Here, we report the first PET imaging evaluation in rhesus monkeys of 4 F-18-labeled spirocyclic piperidine-based PET radiotracers (F-18-1 to F-18-4). Methods: Baseline scans for the 4 radiotracers were obtained on an adult male rhesus monkey. Blocking scans were obtained with the S1R-selective agonist SA4503 to assess binding specificity of F-18-2 and F-18-4. Arterial input functions were measured, and binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis. Results: In the rhesus brain, all 4 radiotracers showed high and fast uptake. Tissue activity washout was rapid for F-18-2 and F-18-4, and much slower for F-18-1 and F-18-3, in line with their respective in vitro S1R-binding affinities. Both the 1-tissue-compartment and multilinear analysis-1 kinetic models provided good fits of time-activity curves and reliable estimates of distribution volume. Regional distribution volume values were highest in the cingulate cortex and lowest in the thalamus for all radiotracers. F-18-4 showed greater differential uptake across brain regions and 3-fold-higher binding potential than F-18-2. SA4503 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg blocked approximately 85% (F-18-2) and 95% (F-18-4) of radiotracer binding. Conclusion: Tracers F-18-2 and F-18-4 displayed high brain uptake and fast tissue kinetics, with F-18-4 having higher specific binding signals than F-18-2 in the same monkey. Taken together, these data indicate that both F-18-2 and F-18-4 possess the requisite kinetic and imaging properties as viable PET tracers for imaging S1R in the human brain.;"[Baum, Evan; Cai, Zhengxin; Bois, Frederic; Holden, Daniel; Lin, Shu-fei; Lara-Jaime, Teresa; Kapinos, Michael; Huang, Yiyun] Yale Univ, Dept Radiol & Biomed Imaging, PET Ctr, New Haven, CT USA; [Chen, Yuanyuan; Jia, Hongmei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Key Lab Radiopharmaceut, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Deuther-Conrad, Winnie; Fischer, Steffen; Dukic-Stefanovic, Sladjana; Brust, Peter] Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Inst Radiopharmaceut Canc Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Bunse, Paul; Wuensch, Bernhard] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Dept Pharmaceut & Med Chem, Munster, Germany";"Yale University; Beijing Normal University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR); University of Munster";Huang, YY (corresponding author), Yale PET Ctr, 801 Howard Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;henry.huang@yale.edu;"Chen, Yuanyuan/GXG-2130-2022; Cai, Jason/AAB-2335-2020";"Jia, Hongmei/0000-0002-1412-8158; Deuther-Conrad, Winnie/0000-0003-3168-3062; Dukic-Stefanovic, Sladjana/0009-0002-7482-913X";;;;;38;17;17;2;12;SOC NUCLEAR MEDICINE INC;RESTON;1850 SAMUEL MORSE DR, RESTON, VA 20190-5316 USA;0161-5505;1535-5667;;J NUCL MED;J.

In each of these three domains the rodent model exhibits striking similarities to humans. We hypothesize that there is a specific thalamo-cortical-basal ganglia network that subserves spatial attentional functions. Key components of this network are medial agranular and posterior parietal cortex, dorsocentral striatum, and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus. Several issues need to be addressed before we can hope to realistically understand or model the functions of this networks Among these are the roles of medial versus lateral posterior parietal cortex; cholinergic mechanisms in attention; interhemispheric interactions; the role of synchronous firing at the cortical, striatal, and thalamic levels; interactions between cortical and thalamic projections to the striatum; interactions between cortical and nigral inputs to the thalamus; the role of collicular inputs to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; the role of cerebral cortex versus superior colliculus in driving the motor output expressed as orienting behavior during directed attention; the extent to which the circuitry we describe for directed attention also plays a role in other forms of attention.

The dense plexus of calbindin-immunoreactive fibres that characterizes VMpo in primates enables its homologue to be identified in the human thalamus by immunohistochemical labelling for calbindin. We have now analysed in detail the cytoarchitectonic characteristics of VMpo and its relationship with immunoreactivity for calbindin, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the human thalamus. The area in the posterolateral thalamus in which dense calbindin-immunoreactive fibre terminations are present:coincides nearly completely with a distinct region that contains small to medium-sized cells with round or oval shapes that are aggregated in clusters separated by cell sparse areas. This region, which we identify as VMpo, is located posteromedial to the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei, ventral to the anterior pulvinar and centre median nuclei, lateral to the limitans and parafascicular nuclei and dorsal to the medial geniculate nucleus. Calbindin-immunoreactive fibres enter VMpo from the spinal lemniscus and form large patches of dense terminal-like staining over clusters of VMpo neurons. A few of these clusters also display terminal-like substance P labelling. Small bursts of CGRP staining are intercalated between the calbindin-labelled clusters, but there is little or no overlap between these two markers. CGRP immunoreactivity is also present over small, non-clustered neurons in the calbindin-negative area that separates VMpo from the VPL and VPM nuclei, which we denote as the posterior nucleus (Po). These observations provide a concise description of VMpo in the human thalamus. Further, they suggest that the lamina I spinothalamic tract fibres (represented by calbindin and probably also substance P immunoreactivity) and vagal-solitary-parabrachial afferents (represented by CGRP immunoreactivity) form closely related, but separate, termination fields that can be considered to represent different aspects of enteroceptive information regarding the physiological status of the tissues and organs of the body. The location of VMpo and the adjacent Po fits with clinical descriptions of-the thalamic area from which pain, temperature and visceral sensations can be evoked by microstimulation, and where nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons have been recorded in humans. It also corresponds to the area in which infarcts cause analgesia and thermoanaesthesia and can lead to the paradoxical development of central pain.;"Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed & Surg, Div Cell Biol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden; Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurosurg, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA";"Linkoping University; Barrow Neurological Institute";Blomqvist, A (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed & Surg, Div Cell Biol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden.;andbl@mcb.liu.se;Blomqvist, Anders/K-3990-2019;Blomqvist, Anders/0000-0002-6928-4473;NINDS NIH HHS [NS25616] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;108;119;119;0;17;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;MAR;2000;123;;3;;;;601;619;;10.1093/brain/123.3.601;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/123.3.601;;;19;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;293DV;10686182;Bronze;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000085837000015;View Full Record in Web of Science

According to their model, core auditory cortex receives predominantly unimodal sensory input from the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGBv); whereas belt cortex receives predominantly cross-modal sensory input from nuclei outside the MGBv. We previously characterized distinct response properties in rat primary (A1) versus ventral auditory field (VAF) cortex; however, it has been unclear whether VAF should be categorized as a core or belt auditory cortex. The current study employed high-resolution functional imaging to map intrinsic metabolic responses to tones and to guide retrograde tracer injections into A1 and VAF. The size and density of retrogradely labeled somas in the medial geniculate body (MGB) were examined as a function of their position along the caudal-to-rostral axis, subdivision of origin, and cortical projection target. A1 and VAF projecting neurons were found in the same subdivisions of the MGB but in rostral and caudal parts, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells projected to both regions. VAF projecting neurons were smaller than A1 projecting neurons located in dorsal (MGBd) and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei. Thus, soma size varied with both caudal-rostral position and cortical target. Finally, the majority (>70%) of A1 and VAF projecting neurons were located in MGBv. These MGB connection profiles suggest that rat auditory cortex, like primate auditory cortex, is made up of multiple distinct core regions. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:1630-1646, 2010.

In addition, portions of the sensory nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc) were explored. Isolated neurons were examined for their responses to somatosensory examination and active movement (n = 919) and for their response to torque-induced joint displacements ( n = 375). A total of 684 neurons was determined histologically to lie within specific subnuclei of the motor (n = 574) or sensory (n = 110) thalamus. The sensorimotor response properties of neurons in the thalamic subnuclei showed clear differences in their response to somatosensory examination. In order of decreasing frequency, the percent of neurons responding to passive somatosensory examination in each subnucleus were as follows: VPLc, 96% (106/110), VPLo, 93% (252/270), VLc, 77% (43/56), VLo, 37% (59/155), Area X, 22%( 12/53), and VA, 12% (5/40). Conversely, neurons that responded only to active movement were most frequent in VLo, 44% (68/155), VA, 45% (18/40), and Area X, 40% (21/53) and relatively infrequent in VLc 11% (6/56) and VPLo, 3% (7/270). In VPLc, no neurons were found that responded only to active movement (0/110). A well-defined somatotopic organization was found in VLo, VPLo, and VPLc and was suggested strongly for VLc. Individual body regions were represented in a series of lamellae, organized in a partial onion skin-like arrangement with the leg represented in the outermost lamella, and the trunk, arm, and orofacial regions represented in successively deeper lamellae. In general the body representations, although present for each subnucleus thoroughly examined, i.e., VLo, VPLo, and VPLc, also were contiguous across subnuclei. Based on the available data, a clear somatotopic picture could not be discerned for Area X or VA. Responses to torque application were more common in neurons in VPLo (77%; 60/78) and VLc (73%; 16/22) than in VLo (44%; 12/27). Mean latencies were shortest for neurons in VPLo (25 +/- 14 ms; mean +/- SD) and the bordering (shell) region of VPLc (22 +/- 15 ms) and were approximately twice as long in VLc (51 +/- 23 ms) and VLo (47 +/- 21 ms). Short-latency (<20 ms) responses to torque application were found for a large proportion of cells in VPLo (45%; 27/60). These neurons were located largely in the lateral portions of ventro-caudal VPLo. The presence of short-latency torque responses in this portion of VPLo suggests that this region may act as a direct relay for proprioceptive information from the periphery to the motor cortex because this area of VPLo has been demonstrated to project directly to the motor cortex. Although mean firing frequencies for VPLo (22 +/- 11 Hz) were different from other subnuclei within the motor thalamus (12 +/- 8, 13 +/- 8, 15 +/- 8, and 12 +/- 8 Hz for VLc, VLo, VA, and Area X, respectively), there was a wide distribution of average rates with significant overlap between subnuclei. Mean firing frequencies in VPLc (26 +/- 8 Hz) were similar to those in VPLo.

To address this question we used neural tracers to label pathways linking areas involved in emotional and attentional processes in the primate brain (Macaca mulatta). We report that a novel pathway from the amygdala, the brain's emotional center, targets the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a key node in the brain's attentional network. The amygdalar pathway formed unusual synapses close to cell bodies of TRN neurons and had more large and efficient terminals than pathways from the orbitofrontal cortex and the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus, which similarly innervated extensive TRN sites. The robust amygdalar pathway provides a mechanism for rapid shifting of attention to emotional stimuli. Acting synergistically, pathways from the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex provide a circuit for purposeful assessment of emotional stimuli. The different pathways to TRN suggest distinct mechanisms of attention to external and internal stimuli that may be differentially disrupted in anxiety and mood disorders and may be selectively targeted for therapeutic interventions.;"[Zikopoulos, Basilis; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Boston, MA 01772 USA";"Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Zikopoulos, B (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Neural Syst Lab, Dept Hlth Sci, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 443A, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;zikopoul@bu.edu;Zikopoulos, Basilis/K-2443-2012;"Zikopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0002-8834-5104; Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832";"NIH (NIMH, NINDS); NSF (CELEST)";"NIH (NIMH, NINDS); NSF (CELEST)";This work was supported by grants from the NIH (NIMH, NINDS) and NSF (CELEST).

Preferred directions are influenced by visual cues as well as idiothetic self-motion cues derived from vestibular, proprioceptive, motor efferent copy, and command signals. To distinguish the relative importance of active locomotor signals, we compared HD cell response properties in 49 anterodorsal thalamic HD cells of six male Long-Evans rats during active displacements in a foraging task as well as during passive rotations. Since thalamic HD cells typically stop firing if the animals are tightly restrained, the rats were trained to remain immobile while drinking water distributed at intervals from a small reservoir at the center of a rotatable platform. The platform was rotated in a clockwise/counterclockwise oscillation to record directional responses in the stationary animals while the surrounding environmental cues remained stable. The peak rate of directional firing decreased by 27% on average during passive rotations (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). Individual cells recorded in sequential sessions (n = 8) reliably showed comparable reductions in peak firing, but simultaneously recorded cells did not necessarily produce identical responses. All of the HD cells maintained the same preferred directions during passive rotations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of locomotor activity provides a state-dependent modulation of the response magnitude of AD HD cells. This could result from diffusely projecting neuromodulatory systems associated with motor state.;Coll France, CNRS, LPPA, F-75231 Paris 05, France;"UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; College de France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)";Wiener, SI (corresponding author), Coll France, CNRS, LPPA, 11 Pl Marcelin Berthelot, F-75231 Paris 05, France.;sidney.wiener@college-de-france.fr;;Zugaro, Michael/0000-0002-6199-2635;;;;;39;41;41;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Inflammatory changes in brain could underlie this injury. Here, we evaluated whether neuroinflammation is induced by chorioamnionitis in a clinically relevant model. Methods: Rhesus macaque fetuses were exposed to either intra-amniotic (IA) saline, or IA lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg) 16 or 48 h prior to delivery at 130 days (85 % of gestation) (n = 4-5 animals/group). We measured cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), froze samples from the left brain for molecular analysis, and immersion fixed the right brain hemisphere for immunohistology. We analyzed the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, CCL2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2 in the periventricular white matter (PVWM), cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum by RT-qPCR. Brain injury was assessed by immunohistology for myelin basic protein (MBP), IBA1 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte marker), NeuN (neuronal marker), CD3 (T cells), and CD14 (monocytes). Microglial proliferation was assessed by co-immunostaining for IBA1 and Ki67. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. Results: IA LPS increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PVWM, thalamus, and cerebellum, increased IL-6 concentration in the CSF, and increased apoptosis in the periventricular area after 16 h. Microglial proliferation in the white matter was increased 48 h after IA LPS. Conclusions: LPS-induced chorioamnionitis caused neuroinflammation, microglial proliferation, and periventricular apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of chorioamnionitis in fetal rhesus macaques. These findings identify specific responses in the fetal brain and support the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory changes may mediate the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with chorioamnionitis.;"[Schmidt, Augusto F.; Kannan, Paranthaman S.; Jobe, Alan H.; Kallapur, Suhas G.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neonatol & Pulm Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Chougnet, Claire A.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Immunobiol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Danzer, Steve C.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesia, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Miller, Lisa A.] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Miller, Lisa A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pediat & Cell Biol & Human Anat, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Kallapur, SG (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Neonatol & Pulm Biol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.;suhas.kallapur@cchmc.org;"Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/H-3992-2018; Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/B-6428-2011; Schmidt, Augusto F/N-4456-2015";"Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/0000-0002-3333-3720; Senthamaraikannan, Paranthaman/0000-0002-3333-3720; Schmidt, Augusto F/0000-0002-3925-9429";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award; March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund; Preterm Initiative";"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award; March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award; Burroughs-Wellcome Fund(Burroughs Wellcome Fund); Preterm Initiative";The funding sources for this study are Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center-Arnold Strauss Fellows' Award (A.F.S), March of Dimes Innovation catalyst award (S.G.K), Burroughs-Wellcome Fund, and Preterm Initiative (C.A.C.).;;50;29;30;0;5;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1742-2094;;;J NEUROINFLAMM;J.

Cat areas 17, 18, and 19 can be equated with macaque areas V1, V2, and V3, respectively, based on criteria of relative position in the cortical mantle, internal organization of visual field representations, and trans- and subcortical connections. Using these same criteria, a visual area on the medial bank of the lateral suprasylvian sulcus (area PMLS) in the cat can be equated with macaque area V5. The equivalences are supported by data on neuronal receptive field properties and the contributions the areas make to visual behavior. Although the data are scanty for most other visual areas, there are enough data tentatively to equate collectively cat areas 20a and 20b with macaque areas TF and TH and to liken cat areas 21a and 21b with macaque area V4. What is not clear is if there is a region in cat that is equivalent to area TE in the macaque monkey. If there is, it likely lies on the banks of the posterior suprasylvian sulcus between areas 20 and 21 and the polysensory cortex of the posterior ectosylvian gyrus. Knowledge gained from prior research on macaque areas V4 and TE can be used to formulate specific additional investigations of cat area 21 and the uncharted posterior suprasylvian sulcus. In addition, prior investigations carried out on cat area 20 can be used to devise specific explorations of macaque areas TF and TH.;;;PAYNE, BR (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, 80 E CONCORD ST, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA.;;;;NIMH NIH HHS [MH44647] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;311;182;183;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

The usual CA-CP system did not appear satisfactory for stereotaxy of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus. Variation studies on ventriculograms and reconstructions from histological material were done to find more reliable systems. The most precise system of coordinates for cartography and stereotaxy of the amygdala is based on the 'amygdalar notch', a ventricular diverticulum forming the angle between the inferior and anterior borders of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, located beneath the inferior border of the amygdala. The AN point, the vertex of the notch in the sagittal direction, is a reliable ventricular landmark in the antero-posterior and infero-superior directions. The medial vertex of the diverticulum, ANm, is a ventricular landmark in the medio-lateral direction. The 'AN system of coordinates' is a reliable system for amygdalar stereotaxy. Stereotaxy of the anterior hippocampus would benefit from other ventricular landmarks. The most lateral point of the main body (HiL) is a landmark for the medio-lateral dimension. Ventriculography and ventricular landmarks should always be used for stereotaxy in primate species.

We determined regional brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex) immune and virological profiles at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) with SIVmac239 in rhesus macaques. The basal ganglia and thalamus had detectable viruses earlier (7 dpi) than the frontal cortex (14 dpi) and contained higher quantities of viruses than the latter. Increased immune activation of astrocytes and significant infiltration of macrophages in the thalamus at 14 dpi coincided with elevated plasma viral load, and SIV colocalized only within macrophages. RNA signatures of proinflammatory responses, including IL-6, were detected at 7 dpi in microglia and interestingly, preceded reliable detection of virus in tissues and were maintained in the chronically infected macaques. Countering the proinflammatory response, the antiinflammatory response was not detected until increased TGF-beta expression was found in perivascular macrophages at 14 dpi. But this response was not detected in chronic infection. Our data provide evidence that the interplay of acute proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses in the brain likely contributed to the overt neuroinflammation, where the immune activation preceded reliable viral detection.;"[Gopalakrishnan, Raja Mohan; Aid, Malika; Mercado, Noe B.; Davis, Caitlin; Malik, Shaily; Geiger, Emma; Varner, Valerie; Jones, Rhianna; Martinot, Amanda J.; Barouch, Dan H.; Reeves, R.

Using in situ hybridization, we examine the distribution pattern of both GAD mRNAs in the hypothalamus and thalamus of prepubertal and adult male rhesus macaques. Qualitatively, GAD(65) and GAD(67) mRNAs showed a similar wide, but highly specific distribution pattern, supporting the view that GABAergic neurons play an important role in modulating neuroendocrine function. However, no quantitative difference in the intensity of hybridization signal was detected between prepubertal and adult animals in any of the hypothalamic or thalamic nuclei. Therefore, although GABAergic neurons are anatomically well-placed to control the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in primates, it is unlikely that the onset of puberty and the associated increase in GnRH secretion is triggered by a change in GAD gene transcription.

We tested this in awake Macaca fascicularis by stimulating between pairs of electrodes inserted into GPi under electrophysiological control and recording the responses evoked in thalamic neurons. HFS produced a reduction, not an increase, in discharge frequency during the stimulus train in 77% of the responsive thalamic neurons. Only 16% of the responsive cells showed an increase in discharge during stimulation and, for some of these, stimulation at a similar intensity produced contralateral muscle contraction, a probable sign of current spread to the internal capsule. The few thalamic neurons studied during bursting had a reduction in burst frequency and duration during HFS. We conclude that high-frequency stimulation within GPi does not necessarily facilitate thalamic discharge, and it may act, instead, to interrupt abnormal patterns of thalamic discharge associated with parkinsonian symptoms.;"Univ Washington, Dept Rehabil Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Physiol & Biophys, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Grad Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Univ Washington, Reg Primate Res Ctr, Seattle, WA 98195 USA";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";Anderson, ME (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Rehabil Med, Box 356490, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;;;;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR-00166] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-38228] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;38;199;203;0;15;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP) may also play a role in directed attention and neglect because LP has robust reciprocal connections with these cortical areas and projects to DCS. We used anterograde axonal tracing to map thalamostriatal projections from LP and surrounding thalamic nuclei, with a focus on projections to DCS. The thalamic nuclei investigated included LP, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus (LD), central lateral nucleus (CL), and posterior thalamic nucleus (Po). We found that the mediorostral part of LP (LPMR) projects strongly to DCS as well as to the dorsal peripheral region of the striatum. Further, there is topography within LPMR and DCS such that the far medial LPMR projects to the central region of DCS (projection area of AGm) and the central LPMR projects to the dorsal region of DCS (projection area of PPC and Oc2M). In contrast, the laterorostral part of LP (LPLR) and other thalamic nuclei surrounding LP project to dorsolateral to dorsomedial peripheral regions of the striatum but do not project to DCS. These findings indicate that DCS is a region of convergence for thalamostriatal and corticostriatal projections from regions that are themselves interconnected, serving as the key element of the corticostriatal-thalamic network mediating spatial processing and directed attention.

As expected, all of the neurons in the visual sector were immunoreactive for GAD, the synthesizing enzyme for GABA, but the distribution of SOM-immunoreactive cells was not uniform. It appeared that every cell in the medial tier was immunoreactive for SOM, but that very few cells in the lateral tier contained this neuropeptide. The significance of the difference in reticular neuron SOM content could be related to the functional differences between the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which is connected reciprocally with the lateral tier, and the pulvinar nucleus, which is connected reciprocally with the medial tier.;VET ADM MED CTR,JOSEPH & KATHLEEN BRYAN ALZHEIMER DIS RES CTR,DURHAM,NC 27705;"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA)";CONLEY, M (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,DURHAM,NC 27706, USA.;;;;;;;;50;9;9;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

However, it is unknown whether, and how, these structures are engaged during the observation of actions performed by effectors different from the hand. To address this issue, in the present fMRI study, healthy human participants were required to execute or to observe grasping acts performed with different effectors, namely mouth, hand, and foot. As control, participants executed and observed simple movements performed with the same effectors. The results show that: (1) execution of goal-directed actions elicited somatotopically organized activations not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus; (2) action observation evoked cortical, cerebellar and subcortical activations, lacking a clear somatotopic organization; (3) in the territories displaying shared activations between execution and observation, a rough somatotopy could be revealed in both cortical, cerebellar and subcortical structures. The present study confirms previous findings that action observation, beyond the cerebral cortex, also activates specific sectors of cerebellum and subcortical structures and it shows, for the first time, that these latter are engaged not only during hand actions observation but also during the observation of mouth and foot actions. We suggest that each of the activated structures processes specific aspects of the observed action, such as performing internal simulation (cerebellum) or recruiting/inhibiting the overt execution of the observed action (basal ganglia and sensory-motor thalamus).";"[Errante, Antonino; Gerbella, Marzio; Fogassi, Leonardo] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy; [Errante, Antonino] Univ Hosp Parma, Dept Diagnost, Neuroradiol unit, Via Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Mingolla, Gloria P.] Univ Verona, Dept Neurosci Biomed & Movement Sci, Piazzale Ludov Antonio Scuro 10, I-37124 Verona, Italy";"University of Parma; University of Parma; University Hospital of Parma; University of Verona";Fogassi, L (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Via Volturno 39, I-43125 Parma, Italy.;"antonino.errante@unipr.it; marzio.gerbella@unipr.it; leonardo.fogassi@unipr.it";;Mingolla, Gloria P./0000-0002-2596-1428;;;;;92;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0896-0267;1573-6792;;BRAIN TOPOGR;Brain Topogr.;JUL;2023;36;4;;;;;476;499;;10.1007/s10548-023-00960-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-023-00960-1;;MAY 2023;24;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;J8XQ3;37133782;hybrid, Green Accepted;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000979814900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

One possible underlying pathophysiology is serotonergic dysfunction. In this study, we used an animal model of HIV, the SIV-infected macaque, to longitudinally image serotonin transporter (SERT) expression before and after inoculation, using 11C-DASB (SERT ligand) PET imaging. Methods: We infected seven rhesus macaques with a neurovirulent SIV strain and imaged them at baseline and multiple time points after inoculation (group A). Pyrosequencing methylation analysis of the SERT promoter region was performed. We also measured SERT mRNA/protein in brain single-cell suspensions from another group (group B) of SIV-infected animals (n = 13). Results: Despite some animals showing early fluctuations, 86% of our group A animals eventually showed a net increase in midbrain/thalamus binding potential (BPND) over the course of their disease (mean increased binding between last time point and baseline = 30.2% and 32.2%, respectively). Repeated-measures mixed-model analysis showed infection duration to be predictive of midbrain BPND (p = 0.039). Thalamic BPND was statistically significantly associated with multiple CSF cytokines (P < 0.05). There was higher SERT protein levels in the second group (group B) of SIV-infected animals with SIV encephalitis (SIVE) compared to those without SIVE (p = 0.014). There were no longitudinal changes in SERT gene promoter region percentage methylation between baselines and last time points in group A animals. Conclusion: Upregulated SERT leading to lower synaptic levels of serotonin is a possible mechanism of depression in HIV+ patients, and extrapolating our conclusions from SIV to HIV should be sought using translational human studies.;"[Shah, Swati; Sinharay, Sanhita; Schreiber-Stainthorp, William; Muthusamy, Siva; Lee, Dianne; Hammoud, Dima A.] NIH, CIDI, Radiol & Imaging Sci, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Matsuda, Kenta; Hirsch, Vanessa] NIAID, Lab Mol Microbiol, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Wakim, Paul] NIH, Biostat & Clin Epidemiol Serv, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Nath, Avindra] NINDS, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Di Mascio, Michele] NIAID, AIDS Imaging Res Sect, Div Clin Res, NIH, Rockville, MD USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Clinical Center (CC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Clinical Center (CC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)";Hammoud, DA (corresponding author), NIH, CIDI, Radiol & Imaging Sci, Clin Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;hammoudd@cc.nih.gov;Hammoud, Dima A/C-2286-2015;"Schreiber-Stainthorp, William/0000-0002-7386-8754; Di Mascio, Michele/0000-0001-6609-9689; Hammoud, Dima/0000-0001-7406-7871; Sinharay, Sanhita/0000-0001-9910-996X";"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH); Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NIH [HHSN261200800001E]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [ZIAAI000370] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Cancer Institute, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID))";Funding for this study was provided in part by the intramural research program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and by the Center for Infectious Disease Imaging (CIDI), Clinical Center, NIH.

The saturation of 2-fluoro-A-85380 SE in the thalamus was analyzed on the same animal by administering different masses of the ligand. Our results demonstrated that the SE in the thalamus was saturable. The ligand at a dose of 70 nmol/kg occupied 85% of nAChRs and at a dose of ca. 8.7 nmol/kg (ED50) 50% of nAChRs Using Scatchard analysis, the density of nAChRs in Rhesus monkey thalamus in vivo was calculated as ca. 5.5 pmol/g tissue. This value was in close agreement with estimates from in vitro assays of Rhesus monkey brain tissue.;NIDA, Brain Imaging Ctr, NIH, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)";Chefer, SI (corresponding author), NIDA, Brain Imaging Ctr, NIH, 5500 Nathan Shock Dr, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.;;;;;;;;19;3;3;0;1;C S R E A PRESS;ATHENS;115 AVALON DR, ATHENS, GA 30606 USA;;;1-892512-62-9;;;;2000;;;;;;;409;415;;;;;;7;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Biomedical; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications";Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S);"Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematics";BR81W;;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000167662700061;View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this work was to explore the cortical and subcortical mechanisms underlying the execution of voluntary saccadic eye movements in humans. 2. Normalized regional cerebral blood flow (NrCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and (H2O)-O-15 bolus intravenous injections in four right-handed healthy volunteers at rest and while performing self-paced voluntary horizontal saccadic eye movements in total darkness. 3. Magnetic resonance imaging of each subject's brain was matched to PET images, allowing the detection of activation in individually defined anatomic regions of interest. Cortical regions were drawn according to gyri limits; subcortical structures were also defined. 4. Self-paced saccadic eye movements elicited bilateral NrCBF increases in the lenticular nuclei, including putamen and globus pallidus, and in the thalamus. At the cortical level, we found bilateral NrCBF increases in the precentral gyrus, the superior part of the median frontal gyrus that corresponds to the supplementary motor area. There was also a significant NrCBF increase in the cerebellar vermis. 5. Right fusiform and lingual gyri, right insula, and left cingulate gyrus were also activated during the execution of saccades. 6. These results indicate that the classical basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loop previously described for skeletal movements may also be involved in simple saccadic eye movements in humans.";"SERV HOSP FREDERIC JOLIOT,CEA,DRIPP,IMAGERIE NEUROFONCT GRP,4 PL GEN LECLERC,F-91406 ORSAY,FRANCE; CHU TIMONE,SERV NEURORADIOL,F-13000 MARSEILLE,FRANCE; HOP ROBERT DEBRE,F-75935 PARIS,FRANCE; LAB PHYSIOL NEUROSENSORIELLE,CNRS,F-75270 PARIS 06,FRANCE";"CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre - APHP; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)";;;"mazoyer, bernard m/A-5369-2009; GINSPAN, All/B-8714-2008; Orssaud, Christophe/ACM-6549-2022; Petit, Laurent/D-6583-2011; Tzourio-Mazoyer, Nathalie/B-5598-2008; Mazoyer, Bernard M/B-6303-2012; Petit, Laurent/M-3888-2019";"mazoyer, bernard m/0000-0003-0970-2837; Petit, Laurent/0000-0003-2499-5367; Tzourio-Mazoyer, Nathalie/0000-0002-6236-4390; Mazoyer, Bernard M/0000-0003-0970-2837; Petit, Laurent/0000-0003-2499-5367";;;;;60;203;204;0;5;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Compared with previous studies, we observed a more widespread distribution of Met-8 in the human diencephalon. Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers exhibited a more widespread distribution in the hypothalamus than in the thalamus. We observed six populations of Met-8immunoreactive cell bodies. These perikarya were observed in the paratenial thalamic nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, pallidohypothalamic nucleus and in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part). In the thalamus, Met-8-immunoreactive fibers were primarily observed in the midline region, whereas in the hypothalamus, these fibers were widely distributed. In general, a moderate/low density of Met-8-immunoreactive fibers was observed in the diencephalic nuclei. A moderate density was observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, reuniens thalamic nucleus, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The present study is the first to demonstrate the presence of clusters of Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies in the human thalamus and hypothalamus, the distribution of fibers containing neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and the presence of these fibers in several thalamic nuclei. This neuroanatomical study will serve to elucidate the physiological roles of Met -8 in future studies of the human diencephalon. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main thalamic projections, which originated in both the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, were topographically organized. Our results suggest the existence of a third, caudal subdivision of this nucleus, which is likely to be homologous to the macaque's pars densocellularis. A substantial, but not topographically organized, projection to Brodmann's area 10 originated in the medial part of the ventral anterior nucleus. Minor thalamic projections originated in the medial pulvinar nucleus and in the midline/intralaminar nuclei. Finally, the posterior thalamic group (including the limitans and suprageniculate nuclei) sent a small projection to rostral area 10 that has not previously been documented in primates. The main extrathalamic projections stemmed from the claustrum, which contained as many as 50% of all subcortical labelled neurons. Minor connections originated in the hypothalamus (mainly in the lateral anterior and lateral tuberal regions), dorsal periaqueductal grey matter, basal forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert and horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca), and amygdala (basal, accessory basal and lateral nuclei). The present results, combined with recent data on the cortical projections to area 10, reveal the frontal pole as a region that integrates information from multiple neural processing systems, including high-level sensory, limbic and working memory-related structures. Although the pattern of subcortical projections is similar to that previously described in the macaque, suggesting a homologous organization, the present data also suggest functional distinctions between medial and lateral sectors of area 10.;"[Burman, Kathleen J.; Reser, David H.; Richardson, Karyn E.; Gaulke, Heidi; Worthy, Katrina H.; Rosa, Marcello G.

The proprioceptive/vestibular area 3aV, the neck-trunk region of area 3a, receives two thirds of its thalamic projections from the oral and superior ventroposterior nucleus (VPO/VPS), which is considered as the proprioceptive relay of the ventroposterior complex (Kaas et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 226:211-240, 1984). The parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC, area retroinsularis, Ri) receives its main thalamic input from posterior parts of the ventroposterior complex and from the medial pulvinar. Anatomical evidence is presented that the posterior region of the ventroposterior complex is a special compartment within this principal somatosensory relay complex. The parietotemporal association area T3, mainly involved in visual-optokinetic signal processing, receives a substantial input from the medial, the lateral, and the inferior pulvinar. Dual tracer experiments revealed that about 5% of the thalamic neurons projecting to 3aV were spatially intermingled with neurons projecting to areas PIVC or T3. This spatial intermingling was distributed over small but numerous, circumscribed thalamic regions, called common patches, which were found mainly in the intralaminar nuclei, the posterior group of thalamic nuclei, and the caudal parts of the ventroposterior complex. The common patches may indicate a functional coupling of area 3aV with the PIVC or area T3 on the thalamic level. In control experiments thalamic projections to the granular insula Ig and the anterior part of area 7, two cerebral structures connected with the vestibular cortical areas, were studied. Some overlap in the thalamic relay structures projecting to these areas with those projecting to the vestibular cortices was found. A quantitative evaluation of thalamic regions projecting to different cortical structures was performed by constructing so-called thalamograms. A scheme was developed that describes the afferent thalamic connections by which vestibular, visual-optokinetic, and proprioceptive signals reach the vestibular cortical areas PIVC and 3aV.;FREE UNIV BERLIN, DEPT PHYSIOL, W-1000 BERLIN 33, GERMANY;Free University of Berlin;;;;;;;;;72;86;88;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Neurons were counted in this same nucleus, allowing the magnification functions (cells/degree(2) as functions of eccentricity) of magnocellular and parvocellular layers to be determined after eliminating the effects of nonuniform volume shrinkage. Parvocellular magnification was approximately 10,000 times higher in the foveola than in the far periphery. On average, magnocellular neurons made up 2.6% of the LGN in the central 2 degrees (but probably a smaller fraction in the central fovea). The magnocellular portion increased steadily with eccentricity to 27% in the far periphery. Thus the magno/parvo ratio increases from foveola to far periphery by a factor of at least 14. The parvocellular magnification function matches estimates of cortical magnification, whereas the density of magnocellular afferents to cortex increases monotonically with eccentricity. At the posterior pole of the nucleus, the numbers of layers are reduced through a fusion of two layers and the disappearance of one or two others, a feature that may be associated with the foveal ipsilateral hemifield representation.

Behavioural investigation of the effects of these disconnections gives information that cannot be derived either from clinical studies or from the effects of bilateral symmetrical ablations in the monkey. Disconnection experiments are particularly suited to the study of the interactions between the components of widespread cortical networks. We propose that memory acquisition is dependent on plastic cortical changes that are widespread, rather than limited to the medial temporal lobe. Further, memory acquisition depends on cortical-subcortical interactions to a greater extent than memory retrieval does. Prefrontal cortex, we suggest, is specifically important in the representation of temporally complex events. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson Srl. All rights reserved.;"[Gaffan, David; Wilson, Charles R.

In particular, modulatory control of processing in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, V1, and V2 will alter the outcome of all subsequent processing of visual information, including the extent to and manner in which individual inputs contribute to perception and decision making and are stored in memory. This review addresses five small-molecule neuromodulators-acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, no-radrenaline, and histamine-considering the structural basis for their action, and the effects of their release, in the early visual pathway of the macaque monkey. Traditionally, neuromodulators are studied in isolation and in discrete circuits; this review makes a case for considering the joint action of modulatory molecules and differences in modulatory effects across brain areas as a better means of understanding the diverse roles that these molecules serve.";[Disney, Anita A.] Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA;Duke University;Disney, AA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA.;anita.disney@duke.edu;;;;;;;87;8;8;1;7;ANNUAL REVIEWS;PALO ALTO;4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA;2374-4642;2374-4650;;ANNU REV VIS SCI;;;2021;7;;;;;;181;199;;10.1146/annurev-vision-100119-125739;http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-vision-100119-125739;;;19;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";"Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";BS2DF;34524875;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000700298000008;View Full Record in Web of Science

These cortical subpopulations display different axonal outgrowth kinetics and innervate distinct thalamic nuclei in a temporal pattern determined by cortical layer identity and subclass specificity. Guidance by molecular cues, structural cues, and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to this development. There is a substantial rearrangement of the corticofugal connectivity outside the thalamus at the border of and within the reticular thalamic nucleus, a region that shares some of the characteristics of the cortical subplate during development. The early transient circuits are not well understood, nor the extent to which this developmental pattern may be driven by peripheral sensory activity.

RLN3 mRNA is highly expressed in rat, mouse, and human brain and molecular genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that RLN3 is the cognate ligand for the relaxin family peptide-3 receptor (RXFP3). The distribution of RLN3/RXFP3 networks has been determined in rat and mouse brain, but not in higher species. In this study we describe the distribution of RLN3 neurons in the brain of macaque (Macaca fascicularis) using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. RLN3 mRNA and high levels of RLN3-like immunoreactivity (-LI) were observed in neurons within a ventromedial region of the central gray of the pons and medulla that appears to represent the primate analog of the nucleus incertus (NI) described in lower species. Nerve fibers and terminals containing RLN3-LI were observed throughout brain regions identical to those known to receive afferents from the NI in the rat, including the septum, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, lateral, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus, supramammillary and interpeduncular nuclei, anterodorsal, paraventricular and reuniens thalamic nuclei, lateral habenula, central gray, and dorsal raphe, solitary tract, and ambiguus nuclei. Experimental studies in the rat strongly implicate a role of this neuropeptide-receptor system in arousal, feeding, and metabolism, learning and memory, and central responses to psychological stressors. These new anatomical findings support the proposition that the RLN3 system is similarly involved in the integration and modulation of behavioral activation and arousal and responses to stress in nonhuman primates and humans.

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques.;"[Waguespack, Hannah F.; Malkova, Ludise; Forcelli, Patrick A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,3970 Reservoir Rd NW, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Turchi, Janita] NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Georgetown University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Turchi, J (corresponding author), NIMH, NIH, 49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;"hgf6@georgetown.edu; malkoval@georgetown.edu; paf22@georgetown.edu; turchij@mail.nih.gov";Forcelli, Patrick A/G-6970-2012;Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X;"Intramural Research Program of the NIMH;  [KL2TR001432];  [R01MH099505]";"Intramural Research Program of the NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); ; ";PAF received support from KL2TR001432.

Peak dose dyskinesia is a major problem in the treatment of parkinsonian patients with levodopa therapy but this remains the best pharmacological agent for treating the condition. The hypothesis was derived from previous work which has suggested that reduced pallidal inhibition of the thalamus results in dyskinesia [Crossman (1990) Movement Dis. 5, 100-108]. A neuroanatomical tracing study was carried out prior to the thalamotomy work, using the anterograde tracer wheatgerm-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. This delineated the anterior part of the ventrolateral thalamus in the primate in terms of its afferent inputs. Wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the medial segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three Macaca fascicularis and traced to terminals in the ventral thalamus and other brain areas. The appropriate thalamic area involved was plotted on atlas sections in preparation for stereotactic thalamotomy. Previous studies of neuronal input to the ventral thalamus are confusing due to the different nomenclatures used by different workers. Early workers used cytoarchitectonic boundaries which do not correspond with function. There are also differences in nomenclature between man, monkey and other animals. The current study maps the pallidal terminal territory within the thalamus in terms of stereotactic co-ordinates related to a published macaque atlas [Shantha et al. (1968) A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Java Monkey Brain. S. Karger, Basel] and can thus be used by other workers in the field. A well-established primate model of Parkinsonism was used for the thalamotomy study. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak-dose dyskinesia which was scored in terms of its choreic and dystonic components. A radiofrequency electrode was used to create the ablative lesions. Chorea was always reduced and frequently abolished by a thalamotomy located in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies in a total of six animals. Four animals received bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations and two animals underwent unilateral surgery. Lesions which were positioned medial to the pallidal terminal territory (n = 3) had no permanent effect upon chorea. Lesions were also made in the thalamic areas which receive cerebellar and nigral inputs and in other areas which receive input from the medial segment of the globus pallidus, including the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the pedunculopontine nucleus. None of these lesions had a significant effect upon peak-dose chorea. In contrast to the dramatic effects upon chorea, peak-dose dystonia was not affected by any of the thalamic lesions. The data suggest that: (i) levodopa-induced chorea can be alleviated by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory of the thalamus and (ii) chorea and dystonia are mediated by different pathophysiological circuits.;;;PAGE, RD (corresponding author), UNIV MANCHESTER,DEPT CELL & STRUCT BIOL,MANCHESTER M13 9PT,LANCS,ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;45;64;65;0;1;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;JUL;1993;55;1;;;;;147;165;;10.1016/0306-4522(93)90462-O;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90462-O;;;19;Neurosciences;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";Neurosciences & Neurology;LL163;7688878;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1993LL16300013;View Full Record in Web of Science

On the basis of a systematic series of tritiated amino acid injections into different portions of the substantia nigra, we found that the rostral three-fourths of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) gives rise to widespread thalamic projections. The nigrothalamic label occupied a longitudinal band extending from rostral ventral anterior nucleus (VA) through to caudal mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In the dog, VA is histochemically identified as an acetylthiocholinesterase (AChE)-negative region and is distinct from the adjacent ventral lateral nuclei which stain positively for AChE. In rostral thalamus, the dense autoradiographic label was observed in rostral VA within the AchE-negative region lying alongside the mammillothalamic tract (MT). The adjacent AChE-positive ventral lateral nuclei did not contain autoradiographic label. In addition, homogeneously distributed silver grains were observed throughout the ventromedial nucleus (VM) bilaterally. More caudally, as the ventral lateral thalamic compartment emerges, label was also observed within the internal medullary lamina region, including the paralaminar portion of VA, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the paralaminar portion of MD. Finally, in caudal thalamus, the central portion of MD, as well as the parafascicular nucleus (Pf), contained autoradiographic label. The overall nigrothalamic distribution observed in the dog was similar to the distribution of nigrothalamic projections in monkeys with one exception. Unlike that of primates, the distribution of nigral efferents is to the whole extent of VM in the dog as in other non-primate species. Overall, we found that nigral efferents primarily project to three main thalamic targets: the VA/MD region, VM, and the internal medullary lamina region, which includes dorsal CL and paralaminar VA and MD. We propose that these three nigrothalamic territories may constitute critical links subserving different functional channels.;;;SAKAI, ST (corresponding author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,COLL HUMAN MED,DEPT ANAT,B517 W FEE,E LANSING,MI 48824, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NSR01-18551] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;46;10;10;1;3;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Particularly, we study whether sources of coherent scattering could contribute to variability of estimates of the effective scatterer size, ESS, used to detect neurotoxic effects of anesthesia. This characterization is performed by computing the generalized spectrum, the echo-amplitude signal-to-noise ratio, and the echo phase histogram nonuniformity, and comparing their values to those obtained from a reference material with diffuse scattering conditions. Results show that scattering conditions in the thalamus can be described mostly as originating from a low scatterer number density (38% of data) and the presence of specular reflectors (36%). Only 23% of the data presented diffuse scattering conditions. Specular reflectors were more likely found in data that showed inconclusive results in a previous ESS analysis of the effects of anesthesia.

The present study was undertaken in the context of surgical treatment of motor disorders such as essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to precisely determine the course and three-dimensional stereotactic localisation of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts in the human brain. The course of the fibre tracts to the thalamus was traced in the subthalamic region using multiple staining procedures and their entrance into the thalamus determined according to our atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia [Morel (2007) Stereotactic atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia. Informa Healthcare Inc., New York]. Stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates were determined by sectioning thalamic and basal ganglia blocks parallel to stereotactic planes and, in two cases, by correlation with magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the same brains prior to sectioning. The major contributions of this study are to provide: (1) evidence that the bulks of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts are clearly separated up to their thalamic entrance, (2) stereotactic maps of the two tracts in the subthalamic region, (3) the possibility to discriminate between different subthalamic fibre tracts on the basis of immunohistochemical stainings, (4) correlations of histologically identified fibre tracts with high-resolution MRI, and (5) evaluation of the interindividual variability of the fibre systems in the subthalamic region.

Multisensory neurons tuned to both vestibular and visual motion (optic flow) signals are found in several cortical areas in the dorsal visual stream. Here we examine whether such convergence occurs subcortically in the macaque thalamus. We searched the ventral posterior nuclei, including the anterior pulvinar, as well as the ventro-lateral and ventral posterior lateral nuclei, areas that receive vestibular signals from brain stem and deep cerebellar nuclei. Approximately a quarter of cells responded to three-dimensional (3D) translational and/or rotational motion. More than half of the responsive cells were convergent, thus responded during both rotation and translation. The preferred axes of translation/rotation were distributed throughout 3D space. The majority of the neurons were excited, but some were inhibited, during rotation/translation in darkness. Only a couple of neurons were multisensory being tuned to both vestibular and optic flow stimuli. We conclude that multisensory vestibular/optic flow neurons, which are commonly found in cortical visual and visuomotor areas, are rare in the ventral posterior thalamus.";"[Meng, Hui; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";Washington University (WUSTL);Angelaki, DE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Box 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;angelaki@wustl.edu;;;National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01-DC-04260];National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD));Experiments were supported by National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Grant R01-DC-04260.;;65;28;28;0;7;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The functional organization of motor responses to microstimulation throughout the primate ''motor'' thalamus including nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo); nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis (VPLo); nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc); and portions of ventralis anterior (VA) and area X, was systematically studied in awake monkeys. A total of 2,021 sites were examined for their response to microstimulation. Of these, 1,123 were histologically verified as to their location within the motor thalamus. At or near each site, isolated neurons were examined for their responses to somatosensory examination and active movement (n = 1,272). This study was carried out as pari of a larger study examining the responses of neurons in the motor thalamus to somatosensory examination, torque-induced limb per turbations, and active movement in a visuomotor step-tracking task. 2. Microstimulation at less than or equal to 40 mu A evoked movements in the contralateral limbs, trunk, or face. Evoked movements of the limb were generally maximal about a single joint. 3. There was a differential response to microstimulation between subnuclei of the motor thalamus. Tn order of decreasing frequency, the percentages of sites within each subnucleus from which movements were evoked were as follows. VPLo, 93% (449 of 483); VLo, 21% (57 of 272); VLc, 11% (15 of 140); VA, 1% (1 of 85), and reticular nucleus, 0% (0 of 65). In VPLc, 44% (34 of 78) of sites examined were microexcitable. However, these were almost all within 500 mu m of the border of VPLo, suggesting they may have occurred as a result of current spread to adjacent VPLo. Although area X was not sampled in its entirety, it did nor appear to be microexcitable. 4, Microexcitable responses had a somatotopic organization, similar to that for neuronal responses to sensorimotor examination, with leg responses found most laterally and arm and face responses found progressively more medially. 5. Zones in VPLo generally ranging from 500 to 1,500 mu m were found in which microstimulation resulted in the same motor response. These microexcitable zones resemble those described for the striatum and were termed thalamic microexcitable zones (TMZ), TMZs also resemble cortical efferent zones in that both are somatotopically organized, may affect a single muscle or group of muscles, have low thresholds for microstimulation with sharp boundaries that lie adjacent to other microexcitable zones with the opposite effects, aid are of approximately the same dimension. 6. This study suggests that a fundamental unit of motor organization, i.e., single muscle or joint, is preserved at the thalamic level in the form of TMZs, and that these fundamental units of organization may contribute to the modular organization of the cortex.";"UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT NEUROL, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55417 USA; VET ADM MED CTR, BRAIN SCI CTR, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55417 USA";"University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Minneapolis VA Health Care System";Vitek, JL (corresponding author), EMORY UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT NEUROL, ATLANTA, GA 30322 USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-01328] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;45;60;64;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

A V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size is larger at lower stimulus contrast. A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the size tuning of V1 cells. We recently demonstrated that V1 horizontal connections integrate signals within a region of the RF center corresponding to the V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size at low contrast; extrastriate feedback connections to V1, instead, are longer range and can integrate signals from the most distant regions of the V1 cell's RF surround. Here, we have determined the contribution of geniculocortical feedforward and corticogeniculate feedback connections to the size-tuning of macaque V1 and lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons, respectively. Specifically, we have quantitatively compared the visuotopic extent of geniculate feedforward afferents to V1 with the size of the RF center and surround of neurons in the V1 input layers and the visuotopic extent of V1 feedback connections to the LGN with the RF size of cells in V1 layer 6, where these connections originate. We find geniculate feedforward connections to provide visuotopic information to V1 that is spatially coextensive with the VI neuron's optimal stimulus size measured with high-contrast gratings. V1 feedback connections restrict their influence to an LGN region visuotopically coextensive with the size of the minimum response field (or classical RF) of V1 layer 6 cells and commensurate with the LGN region from which they receive feedforward connections.";Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA;"Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah";Angelucci, A (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 50 N Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.;alessandra.angelucci@hsc.utah.edu;Angelucci, Alessandra/AAH-8195-2021;Angelucci, Alessandra/0000-0002-1957-2231;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY015262-01A1, R01 EY015262-04, R01 EY015262-01A1S1, R01 EY015262-05, R01 EY015262-03, R01 EY015262, EY 015262, R01 EY015262-02] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;83;66;67;0;12;WILEY-LISS;HOBOKEN;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

In addition to the magnocellular and parvicellular divisions of MD, three other subdivisions can be recognized on the basis of myeloarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and connections. The first two of these represent a parcellation of the magnocellular division into a lateral, fiber-rich MD pars fibrosa and a medial, poorly myelinated MD pars paramediana adjacent to the midline. The third is a small, poorly myelinated area located at the caudomedial and dorsal edges of MD; it is referred to as MD pars caudodorsalis. MD pars fibrosa is reciprocally interconnected primarily with areas 11, 12 and 13 in the central and lateral part of the orbital cortex. There is a general organization within this projection, with the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex represented from dorsal to ventral in the pars fibrosa, and the mediolateral cortical axis represented from medial to lateral. Cells that project to area 12 also extend laterally into the adjacent pars parvicellularis. MD pars paramediana is more heavily interconnected with the caudal and medial portions of the orbital region, particularly the agranular insular areas and the caudal parts of areas 13 and 14. Cells that project to two caudal areas' 13a and Iad, do not fit with the general organization, in that they are located in the dorsomedial parts of the pars fibrosa and pars paramediana, where they overlap with cells that project to area 14. The pars fibrosa and pars paramediana receive inputs from areas of the ventral forebrain such as the amygdala, piriform (olfactory) cortex, and entorhinal cortex, which project directly to the orbital and agranular insular cortex, as well as from the ventral pallidum. MD pars caudodorsalis is reciprocally interconnected with areas 14, 24, and 32 on the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex. In this part of the nucleus the dorsoventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is represented from caudal to rostral in the thalamus. The amygdala and other ventral forebrain structures do not send fibers into the pars caudodorsalis, even though some of these structures project directly to the medial prefrontal cortex. Ventral to MD, and separated from it by the internal medullary lamina, a small region was recognized that appears to be comparable to the anteroventral part of the submedial nucleus previously defined in the rat and cat. This region receives input from the piriform cortex and is interconnected with orbital cortical area 13a.

In the contralateral hemisphere injections of the same tracer involving the full cortical depth were made in homotopical locations, and the distribution and soma size of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons in each side of the thalamus were compared. It was found that, in the cat, labeled neurons in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex, and in paralaminar regions of the ventrolateral complex, were fewer in number and smaller in size in cases of superficial deposits than in cases of deep injection. In more lateral portions of the ventrolateral complex, however, there were no size differences. In the monkey, similar differences in number and size appeared in the caudal division of the ventrolateral complex and in the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, whereas no such differences were found for neurons labeled in the oral and medial divisions of the ventrolateral complex, and in the ventral posteroinferior nucleus. In all cases the intralaminar and midline nuclei exhibited retrogradely labeled neurons only when deep layers were injected. These and previous findings point to the existence of a widely distributed layer I-projecting system of neurons which, in most nuclei, are interspersed among neurons projecting mainly to middle or deep layers. In some nuclei, however, as is the case with the ventromedial nucleus proper, layer I-projecting system neurons would make up the whole nucleus. The cell groups located in a paralaminar position, which would be but a part of this system, could provide through their projections to layer I in the posterior parietal and frontal cortical regions a final path for recruiting responses and spontaneous spindling activities.;;;AVENDANO, C (corresponding author), AUTONOMOUS UNIV MADRID,SCH MED,DEPT MORPHOL,E-28029 MADRID,SPAIN.;;"Avendano, C/R-5413-2019; Rausell, Estrella/L-8781-2014";"Avendano, C/0000-0002-8871-2488; Rausell Tamayo, Estrella/0000-0002-1129-7116";;;;;67;29;29;0;2;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;;1990;39;3;;;;;547;559;;10.1016/0306-4522(90)90242-V;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(90)90242-V;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;EU433;1711168;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1990EU43300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study includes descriptions of some of the major cortical influences on sensory and motor circuits subserving vision, hearing and proprioception, as well as movements of the eyes, head and limbs. It also describes the detailed anatomy of the red nucleus in the monkey, and highlights species differences in this structure. It also postulates that cortical projections to the parvicellular component of the red nucleus provide a recurrent loop returning via the thalamus to the motor cortex. The findings reported in this paper helped to substantiate Kuypers' new theory on the organisation of the descending motor pathways by showing that the primary motor cortex, as well as providing a direct crossed corticospinal input to spinal circuits controlling movements of the distal extremities (hand and foot), also influenced these same circuits through ipsilateral projections to the cells of origin of the rubrospinal tract. In contrast, projections from more rostra] motor, premotor and prefrontal regions terminated bilaterally in the parvicellular red nucleus, and influenced ventromedial descending pathways controlling movements of the head, neck, trunk and proximal limbs. The paper has proved of lasting value to our understanding of sensorimotor control and the contribution of different pathways to it.

Rats were given saline or muscimol infusions into the MATN contralateral to the trained eye before each of four conditioning sessions with an auditory CS. Rats were then given four additional sessions without infusions to assess savings from the initial training. All rats were then given a retention test with a muscimol infusion followed by a recovery session. Muscimol infusions through cannula placements within 0.5 mm of the MGm prevented acquisition of eyeblink conditioned responses (CRs) and also blocked CR retention. Cannula placements more than 0.5 mm from the MATN did not completely block CR acquisition and had a partial effect on CR retention. The primary and secondary effects of MATN inactivation were examined with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Differences in 2-DG uptake in the auditory thalamus were consistent with the cannula placements and behavioral results. Differences in 2-DG uptake were found between groups in the ipsilateral auditory cortex, basilar pontine nuclei, and inferior colliculus. Results from this experiment indicate that the MATN contralateral to the trained eye and its projection to the pontine nuclei are necessary for acquisition and retention of eyeblink CRs to an auditory CS.;"[Halverson, Hunter E.; Poremba, Amy; Freeman, John H.] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA";University of Iowa;Freeman, JH (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;john-freeman@uiowa.edu;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH080005, R01 MH080005] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS038890, R01 NS038890] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;54;30;30;0;0;COLD SPRING HARBOR LAB PRESS, PUBLICATIONS DEPT;COLD SPRING HARBOR;1 BUNGTOWN RD, COLD SPRING HARBOR, NY 11724 USA;1072-0502;;;LEARN MEMORY;Learn.

The thalamic input to these two subregions was studied and quantified to gain more information about the influence of the cerebellum and basal ganglia on the oculomotor control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex. A recent study using transneuronal transport of virus demonstrated that there are neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellum that project to the FEFsac with only a single intervening synapse (Lynch et al., 1994). In the present study, we concentrated on the thalamic input to the FEFsem to define possible basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex and cerebellum-thalamus-cortex channels of information flow to the FEFsem. We localized the functional subregions using low threshold microstimulation, and retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were then placed into the FEFsem and FEFsac. The neurons that project to the FEFsem are distributed in (1) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (2) the caudal portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (3) the mediodorsal nucleus, (4) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars parvocellularis, and (5) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars magnocellularis. In contrast, the large majority of neurons that project to the FEFsac are located in the paralaminar region of the mediodorsal nucleus.

Here we describe the organization of the somatosensory system in a 6-year-old monkey (Macaca radiata) born with a deformed left foot in comparison to the results from a normal monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Toes 1, 3, and 5 were missing, but the proximal parts of toes 2 and 4 were present. We used anatomical tracers to characterize the patterns of peripheral input to the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as between thalamus and cortex. We also determined the somatotopic organization of primary somatosensory area 3b of both hemispheres using multiunit electrophysiological recording. Tracers were subcutaneously injected into matching locations of each foot to reveal their representations within the lumbar spinal cord, and the gracile nucleus (GrN) of the brainstem. Tracers injected into the representations of the toes and plantar pads of cortical area 3b labeled neurons in the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Contrary to the orderly arrangement of the foot representation throughout the lemniscal pathway in the normal monkey, the plantar representation of the deformed foot was significantly expanded and intruded into the expected representations of toes in the spinal cord, GrN, VPL, and area 3b. We also observed abnormal representation of the intact foot in the ipsilateral spinal cord and contralateral area 3b. Thus, congenital malformation influences the somatotopic representation of the deformed as well as the intact foot.;"[Liao, Chia-Chi; Qi, Hui-Xin; Reed, Jamie L.; Miller, Daniel J.; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37212 USA";Vanderbilt University;Liao, CC (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37212 USA.;chia-chi.liao@vanderbilt.edu;Qi, Huixin/IVH-7095-2023;Qi, Huixin/0000-0003-0265-9194;National Institutes of Health [NS16446, NS067017];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This study is supported by National Institutes of Health Grant NS16446 to Jon H.

To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas.;"[Laurens, Jean; Yu, Xiong-Jie; Chan, Raymond; Dickman, David; Angelaki, Dora E.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Liu, Sheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Opthalm Ctr, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiong-Jie] Zhejiang Univ, Interdisciplinary Inst Neurosci & Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiong-Jie] Zhejiang Univ, Qiushi Acad Adv Studies, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, MN USA";"Baylor College of Medicine; Sun Yat Sen University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; University of Rochester";Angelaki, DE (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;angelaki@bcm.edu;;"Liu, Sheng/0000-0002-2497-8666; Angelaki, Dora/0000-0002-9650-8962; DeAngelis, Gregory/0000-0002-1635-1273; Laurens, Jean/0000-0002-9101-2802";"National Eye Institute [EY12814, EY016178]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [DC04260]";"National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))";"National Eye Institute EY12814 Jean Laurens Sheng Liu Xiong-Jie Yu David Dickman Dora E Angelaki; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders DC04260 Jean Laurens Sheng Liu Xiong-Jie Yu David Dickman Dora E Angelaki; National Eye Institute EY016178 Gregory C DeAngelis";;74;23;23;1;8;ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD;CAMBRIDGE;SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND;2050-084X;;;ELIFE;eLife;JAN 11;2017;6;;;;;;;;e20787;10.7554/eLife.20787.001;http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20787.001;;;26;Biology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics;EJ7QR;28075326;gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000393417800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or neurobiotin. J Neurosci Meth 1996;65:113-36], which allows us to functionally characterize and subsequently label single neurons in vivo in macaque VI. The method is generally applicable in acute in vivo preparations. Extracellular recording is made with a patch electrode when the electrode is attached to the cell membrane. Initially a 'blind' search method is used as a guide to obtaining a cell attached configuration that we refer to as a loose-patch (LP). The neuron's receptive field properties are functionally characterized, the neuron is labeled and then characterization is confirmed, all in the LP configuration. There are a number of advantages of the method that we describe over other methods. First, we have found that we can obtain stable extracellular recordings for periods of hours that enable us to make a relatively comprehensive visual functional characterization of a neuron's receptive field properties. Second, because the electrode is closely apposed to the cell we obtain excellent isolation of the extracellular spike. Third, the method provides labeling that gives complete dendritic and axonal filling that survives over a number of days, which is an important feature in acute primate experiments. Fourth, the in vivo method of labeling and reconstructing neurons gives complete three-dimensional structure of the neuron including its intra-cortical axonal arbor. These features overcome known limits of the established methods of studying neuronal morphology including the Golgi stain (limited when adult tissue is used) and in vitro whole cell methods (incomplete axonal filling due to limited slice thickness). They also overcome the known limits of the established method of combined function-morphology studies i.e. intracellular recording in vivo. The modified juxtacellular method provides a reliable alternative to the difficult method of characterization by extracellular recording and subsequent intracellular labeling [Anderson JC, Martin KAC, Whitteridge D. Form, function and intracortical projections of neurons in the striate cortex of the monkey Macacus nemestrinus. Cerebral Cortex 1993;3:412-20]. We show the method can be used to record at a range of depths through V 1 cortex allowing for sampling of neurons in the different layers and functional subpopulations. Links can then be made with existing knowledge about the anatomical organization of V I, the various morphological classes of neurons found therein, their functional connectivity and visual response properties.

In this study, we examined the extent and anatomical organization of cerebellar input to multiple regions of prefrontal cortex. We first used conventional retrograde tracers to map the origin of thalamic projections to five prefrontal regions: medial area 9 (9m), lateral area 9 (9l), dorsal area 46 (46d), ventral area 46, and lateral area 12. Only areas 46d, 9m, and 9l received substantial input from thalamic regions included within the zone of termination of cerebellar efferents. This suggested that these cortical areas were the target of cerebellar output. We tested this possibility using retrograde transneuronal transport of the McIntyre-B strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 from areas of prefrontal cortex. Neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport of virus were found in the dentate nucleus only after injections into areas 46d, 9m, and 9l. The precise location of labeled neurons in the dentate varied with the prefrontal area injected. In addition, the dentate neurons labeled after virus injections into prefrontal areas were located in regions spatially separate from those labeled after virus injections into motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Our observations indicate that the cerebellum influences several areas of prefrontal cortex via the thalamus. Furthermore, separate output channels exist in the dentate to influence motor and cognitive operations. These results provide an anatomical substrate for the cerebellum to be involved in cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, and rule-based learning.;"Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Strick, PL (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurobiol, Sch Med, W1640 Biomed Sci Tower,200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.;strickp@pitt.edu;;Middleton, Frank/0000-0002-3107-7188;NIMH NIH HHS [MH56661, MH48185, F31 MH011262, R01 MH056661, MH11262] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;122;727;747;1;35;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The responses of neurons in this area are not critically dependent on inputs from the primary visual cortex (VC), as lesions of VC leave neuronal response properties in PMLS relatively unchanged (Spear & Baumann, 1979; Spear, 1988; Guido et al., 1990b). However, previous studies have used a limited range of visual stimuli. In this study, we assessed whether neurons in PMLS cortex remained direction-selective to complex motion stimuli following a lesion of VC, particularly to complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Unilateral aspiration of VC was performed on post-natal days 7-9. Single unit extracellular recordings were performed one year later in the ipsilateral PMLS cortex. As in previous studies, a reduction in the percentage of direction selective neurons was observed with drifting sinewave gratings. We report a previously unobserved phenomenon with sinewave gratings, in which there is a greater modulation of firing rate at the temporal frequency of the stimulus in animals with a lesion of VC, suggesting an increased segregation of ON and OFF sub-regions. A significant portion of neurons in PMLS cortex were direction selective to simple (16/18) and complex (11/16) RDKs. However, the strength of direction selectivity to both stimuli was reduced as compared to normals. The data suggest that complex motion processing is still present, albeit reduced, in PMLS cortex despite the removal of VC input. The complex RDK motion selectivity is consistent with both geniculo-cortical and extra-geniculate thalamo-cortical pathways in residual direction encoding.";"Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; Univ Montreal, Ecole Optometrie, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada";"Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal";Casanova, C (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Optometry, Visual Neurosci Lab, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.;christian.casanova@umontreal.ca;"Boire, Denis/I-4530-2019; Ptito, Maurice/G-3422-2013";"Boire, Denis/0000-0001-5614-4976; Ptito, Maurice/0000-0002-5173-5862";;;;;74;4;5;0;0;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0952-5238;1469-8714;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;JAN-FEB;2007;24;1;;;;;53;64;;10.1017/S0952523807070095;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523807070095;;;12;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";163LO;17430609;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000246161500006;View Full Record in Web of Science

From 8-13 g.w. mainly CaBP was expressed in the cells while fiber bundles traversing the thalamus in addition to CaBP expressed all GABA markers except GAD67. CaBP and PARV expression patterns in different nuclei changed over the time course studied, whereas NT was expressed consistently along the anterior-lateral curvature of the thalamus. CalR and SMI were detectable at 23 g.w. in the ventral parts of the dorsal thalamus. Most remarkably, punctate GAD65 immunoreactivity in the neuropil was confined to the nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent receiving nuclei from 16 to about 21 g.w., overlapping with that of CaBP in some of these nuclei (subdivisions of the ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei) and with PARV in others (centromedian nucleus). During this period, GAD65 immunoreactivity can be considered a marker of the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory in the motor thalamus. GAD67-positive local circuit neurons were first detected at 12-13 g.w. in the thalamic nuclei outside the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory. In the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei, GAD-containing local circuit neurons were not conspicuous even at 22-23 g.w. The cells of the reticular nucleus expressed GAD67 and PARV from 12 g.w. on starting in the lateral-posterior regions. By 23 g.w., both markers were expressed in about two-thirds of the nucleus except for its most medial-anterior part. The results imply spatially and temporally differential expression of GABA and differentiation markers in the developing human thalamus.

However, little is known about the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the auditory system of macaque monkeys. In this study, we examined the overall distribution of cell bodies that expressed mRNAs for VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 (markers for glutamatergic neurons), GAD67 (a marker for GABAergic neurons), and GLYT2 (a marker for glycinergic neurons) in the auditory system of the Japanese macaque. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GAD67 in order to compare the distribution of proteins and mRNAs. We found that most of the excitatory neurons in the auditory brainstem expressed VGLUT2. In contrast, the expression of VGLUT1 mRNA was restricted to the auditory cortex (AC), periolivary nuclei, and cochlear nuclei (CN). The co-expression of GAD67 and GLYT2 mRNAs was common in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), CN, and superior olivary complex except for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which expressed GLYT2 alone. In contrast, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and AC expressed GAD67 alone. The absence of co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the medial geniculate, medial superior olive, and VNLL suggests that synaptic responses in the target neurons of these nuclei may be different between rodents and macaque monkeys.

We test the hypothesis that SIV-infection produces proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI)-observed decline in the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and elevations in the glial marker, myo-inositol (mI), and associated creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) in these structures.Design:Pre- and 4-6 weeks post-SIV infection (with CD8(+) T-lymphocyte depletion) was monitored with T-2-weighted quantitative MRI and 16x16x4 multivoxel H-1-MRSI (TE/TR=33/1400ms) in the brains of five rhesus macaques.Methods:Exploiting the high-resolution H-1-MRSI grid, we obtained absolute, cerebrospinal fluid partial volume-corrected NAA, Cr, Cho and mI concentrations from centrum semiovale, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus regions.Results:Pre- to post-infection mean Cr increased in the thalamus: 7.20.4 to 8.0 +/- 0.8mmol/l (+11%, P<0.05); mI increased in the centrum semiovale: 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 0.8mmol/l, caudate: 5.7 +/- 0.7 to 7.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l, thalamus: 6.8 +/- 0.8 to 8.5 +/- 0.8mmol/l and hippocampus: 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.4mmol/l (+29%, +27%, +24% and +29%, all P<0.05). NAA and Cho changes were not significant.Conclusion:SIV-infection appears to cause brain injury indirectly, through glial activation, while the deep gray matter structures' neuronal cell bodies are relatively spared. Treatment regimens to reduce gliosis may, therefore, prevent neuronal damage and its associated neurocognitive impairment.

Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the highcontrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.;"Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA";"Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah";Lund, JS (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, 50 N Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.;Jennifer.Lund@hsc.utah.edu;Angelucci, Alessandra/AAH-8195-2021;Angelucci, Alessandra/0000-0002-1957-2231;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY015262] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;82;166;168;1;8;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

This issue was investigated for the marmoset monkey by recording from 55 single tactile-sensitive neurons in the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) with a projection to either SI or SII, identified with the use of the antidromic collision technique. Neurons activated from the hand and distal forearm were classified according to their peripheral source of input and characterized in terms of their functional capacities to determine whether the direct thalamic input can account for tactile processing in both SI and SII. Both the SI- and SII-projecting samples contained a slowly adapting (SA) class of neurons, sensitive to static skin displacement, and purely dynamically sensitive tactile neurons that could be subdivided into two classes. One was most sensitive to high-frequency (greater than or equal to 100 Hz) cutaneous vibration whose input appeared to be derived from Pacinian sources, while the other was sensitive to lower frequency vibration (less than or equal to 100 Hz) or trains of rectangular mechanical pulse stimuli, that appeared to receive its input from rapidly adapting (RA) afferent fibers presumed to be associated with intradermal tactile receptors. There appeared to be no systematic differences in functional capacities between SI- and SII-projecting neurons of each of these three classes, based on receptive field characteristics, on the form of stimulus-response relations, and on measures derived from these relations. These measures included threshold and responsiveness values, bandwidths of vibrational sensitivity, and the capacity for responding to cutaneous vibrotactile stimuli with phase-locked, temporally patterned impulse activity. The analysis indicates that low-threshold, high-acuity tactile information is conveyed directly to both SI and SII from overlapping regions within the thalamic VP nucleus. This direct confirmation of a parallel functional projection to both SI and SII in the marmoset is consistent with our separate studies at the cortical level that demonstrate first, that tactile responsiveness in SII largely survives the SI inactivation and second, that SI responsiveness is largely independent of SII. It therefore reinforces the evidence that SI and SII occupy a hierarchically equivalent network for tactile processing.;Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;University of New South Wales Sydney;Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Physiol & Pharmacol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;;Zhang, Shi Ping/G-9793-2013;Zhang, Shi Ping/0000-0002-6413-5778;;;;;86;39;40;0;1;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Next to reviewing the role of beta oscillations in human beat perception, here we discuss the role of primate putaminal oscillatory activity in the control of rhythmic movements that are guided by a sensory metronome or internally gated. The analysis of the local field potentials of the behaving macaques showed that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing of the metronome, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, during internally driven rhythmic tapping. Thus, this review emphasizes the need of parametric neurophysiological observations in non-human primates that display a well-controlled behavior during high-level cognitive processes.;"[Merchant, Hugo; Bartolo, Ramon] UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico; [Bartolo, Ramon] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, SLDM, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Merchant, H (corresponding author), UNAM, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Qro, Mexico.;hugomerchant@unam.mx;"Bartolo, Ramon/AAB-6579-2022; Merchant, Hugo/E-8703-2019";"Bartolo, Ramon/0000-0003-2165-9747; Merchant, Hugo/0000-0002-3488-9501";"CONACYT [236836, 196]; PAPIIT [IN202317]";"CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT))";We thank Yaneri Ayala and Dobromir Dotov for their fruitful comments on the manuscript.

They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an amygdalectomy in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after each operation. Disconnection of the amygdala from the ventral striatum was without effect on learning rate. An earlier study had shown that disconnection of the amygdala from either the mediodorsal thalamus or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produced only a mild impairment, significantly less severe than that produced by bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. The present results show, however, that disconnection of the amygdala from both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the same animal, by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and of both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the other hemisphere, produces an impairment as severe as that which follows bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. These results show that, in stimulus - reward associative memory, the role of the amygdala is entirely dependent on its interaction with the frontal lobe, either by direct projections or by indirect subcortical pathways including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus; and that there are at least two partially independent pathways by which the amygdala can influence the frontal lobe.";"NIMH,NEUROPSYCHOL LAB,BETHESDA,MD 20892; UPMC,CNRS,DEPT NEUROSCI VISION ACT,F-75005 PARIS,FRANCE";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite";GAFFAN, D (corresponding author), UNIV OXFORD,DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;"Fabre-Thorpe, Michèle/B-2698-2008; Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019";Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642;;;;;17;112;112;0;0;OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM;OXFORD;WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Collinear flankers can enhance or decrease the perceptual and neuronal sensitivity to flanked stimuli. These effects are mediated through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), in conjunction with feedback from higher visual areas. The strength of lateral interactions is affected by cholinergic neuromodulation. Blockade of muscarinic receptors should increase the strength of lateral intracortical interactions, while nicotinic blockade should reduce thalamocortical feed-forward drive. Here we test this proposal through local iontophoretic application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, while recording single cells in parafoveal representations in awake fixating macaque V1. Collinear flankers generally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptor blockade equally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Contrary to our hypothesis, flanker interactions were not systematically affected by either receptor blockade.;"[Herrero, Jose L.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, New York, NY USA; [Thiele, Alexander] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Henry Wellcome Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England";"Northwell Health; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK";Thiele, A (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Henry Wellcome Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.;alex.thiele@ncl.ac.uk;;;"BBSRC [BBS/B/09325]; Wellcome Trust [070380/z/03/z]; MRC [G0700976]; MRC [G0700976] Funding Source: UKRI";"BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";This work was supported by the BBSRC (BBS/B/09325), the Wellcome Trust (070380/z/03/z), and the MRC (G0700976) and by the excellent technical support by the CBC.;;70;0;0;0;0;NATURE PORTFOLIO;BERLIN;HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY;2045-2322;;;SCI REP-UK;Sci Rep;APR 16;2021;11;1;;;;;;;8384;10.1038/s41598-021-88044-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88044-7;;;15;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;RP5WR;33863988;gold, Green Published;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000641799700015;View Full Record in Web of Science

The subcortical connections of MST and FST were found to be very similar. Both areas were found to be reciprocally connected with the pulvinar, mainly with its medial subdivision, and with the claustrum. Nonreciprocal projections from both MST and FST were consistently found in the striatum (caudate and putamen), reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the pontine nuclei. The labeled terminals in the pons were in the dorsolateral, lateral, dorsal, and peduncular nuclei. Additional nonreciprocal projections were found in one MST and one FST case to the nucleus of the optic tract, and, in one FST case, to the lateral terminal nucleus. Finally, three cases showed a nonreciprocal projection to FST from the basal forebrain. The subcortical structures containing label following MST and FST injections were largely the same as those labeled after injections of the middle temporal visual area (MT), but the label within each structure after MST and FST injections was more widespread than that from MT, overlapping the distribution of label that has been reported after injections of parietal visual areas. This finding is consistent with the known contributions of MST and FST to the functions of parietal cortex, such as eye-movement control.;NIMH,NEUROPSYCHOL LAB,BLDG 9,ROOM 1E104,BETHESDA,MD 20892;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";;;"Desimone, Robert/G-1121-2018; Boussaoud, Driss/B-6932-2008";"Boussaoud, Driss/0000-0002-7295-2890; Desimone, Robert/0000-0002-5938-4227";;;;;71;106;106;0;15;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;SEP-OCT;1992;9;3-4;;;;;291;302;;10.1017/S0952523800010701;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800010701;;;12;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";JN067;1390388;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1992JN06700009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Orbitofrontal cortices participate in olfactory functions, but the pathways through which they receive olfactory or other input have not been clearly defined. The retrograde tracers horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes were injected in orbital cortices to study their afferent cortical connections. Labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas (prepiriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle) were directed mainly to a posterior orbitofrontal region and to a lesser extent the neighboring caudal part of area 13. There was no evidence of direct projections from primary olfactory areas to the rostral parts of area 13, or to areas 12 or 11. Most labeled neurons in primary olfactory areas were directed to agranular cortices, fewer projected to dysgranular areas, and there was no evidence that any reached granular cortices. The areas which received the most robust olfactory projections showed the lowest degree of laminar organization among prefrontal cortices. Early processing in the olfactory system thus takes place in areas which differ sharply on structural grounds from ''early'' eulaminate post-Rolandic sensory cortices. In addition to olfactory cortical projections, numerous labeled neurons in transitional (limbic) cortices were directed to orbital areas, and fewer but still substantial numbers of afferent neurons were found in eulaminate cortices. Unlike post-Rolandic unimodal sensory areas, which seem to be committed to the processing of input from one sensory modality via sequential and/or parallel pathways, caudal orbital areas received highly distributed input from primary olfactory areas, and in addition, from gustatory, visual, auditory and somatosensory areas. The structural and connectional features of olfactory recipient orbital cortices thus differ markedly from those observed in other sensory association areas and suggest a mode of processing adapted early in cortical evolution.;"BOSTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, BOSTON, MA 02118 USA; HARVARD UNIV, SCH MED, NEW ENGLAND REG PRIMATE RES CTR, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA";"Boston University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";BARBAS, H (corresponding author), BOSTON UNIV, DEPT HLTH SCI, 635 COMMONWEALTH AVE 431, BOSTON, MA 02215 USA.;;;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;NINDS NIH HHS [NS24760] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;92;196;197;0;7;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;OCT;1993;56;4;;;;;841;864;;10.1016/0306-4522(93)90132-Y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90132-Y;;;24;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;MB766;8284038;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1993MB76600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Dysregulation of the CRF system may underlie the pathophysiology of several disorders, including depression and anxiety. The distribution of CRF1 mRNA and CRF1 specific ligand binding has been reported by multiple groups in rodents using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, respectively. More recently, somewhat conflicting rodent anti-CRF1 immunohistochemical studies were reported. In this study we report the generation of an antihuman CRF1 antiserum and provide the first immunohistochemical description of CRF1 distribution in a primate brain, that of the rhesus monkey. The specificity of anti-CRF-R1 antiserum R221 was demonstrated using transfected hCRF(1)-expressing HEK 293 cells and rhesus monkey pituitary. CRF1-immunoreactive neurons were widespread in the rhesus brain. CRF1 staining was associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites and was primarily intracellular, suggesting a high rate of receptor turnover or receptor sequestration. Anti-CRF1 immunoreactivity was most abundant in pituitary, cerebellum, and in portions of brain stem associated with sensorimotor function. CRF1 staining was also observed in cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, portions of the basal ganglia, and thalamus. Staining was relatively low in prefrontal cortex and in limbic areas, which may reflect masking of the N-terminal epitope. The distribution of CRF1 immunoreactivity is suggestive of roles in attentional processing as well as the processing of motor and sensory information.

We were able to distinguish many more areas in both taxa than have been recognized in most previous studies of the primate frontal lobe. In particular, we were able to subdivide many of the areas shown in the commonly cited architectonic map of Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, 1940). Delineation of areas was greatly facilitated by the use of the Gallyas technique for staining myelin. The areal organization of much of frontal cortex (specifically, the premotor, orbital, and medial regions) appears to be very similar in Galago and Macaca. In these regions, we were able to recognize the same complement of areas in both taxa, with few exceptions. In the granular frontal cortex (GFC), by contrast, we were able to distinguish about twice as many areas in Macaca as in Galago. For most of the GFC areas of Galago, there are architectonically similar areas in Macaca; the areas shared by both taxa correspond mainly to the arcuate and superior areas of Macaca (i.e., the region encompassed by Walker's areas 45, 8A, and 8B). However, there are many additional, more rostral, areas in Macaca for which there are no obvious homologues in Galago. In particular, Galago lacks cortex resembling the distinctive, lightly myelinated cortex of the Macaca principal sulcus (Walker's area 46 and its subdivisions). Our results are difficult to reconcile with the view that frontal lobe organization varies little across taxa. Rather, they suggest that granular frontal cortex underwent considerable change during primate evolution, including the addition of new areas in anthropoids.";"YALE UNIV, SCH MED, NEUROBIOL SECT, NEW HAVEN, CT 06510 USA; YALE UNIV, DEPT ANTHROPOL, NEW HAVEN, CT 06520 USA";"Yale University; Yale University";;;Preuss, Todd/GSI-6571-2022;;NIMH NIH HHS [NIMH 38546, NIMH 09146] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;153;258;259;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Among the limbic cortical connections, the ones with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are particularly salient. Sensory cortices connected with the OfC include areas involved in olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. Subcortical structures with prominent OfC connections include the amygdala. numerous thalamic nuclei. the striatum, hypothalamus. periaqueductal gray matter, and biochemically specific cell groups in the basal forebrain and brainstem. Architectonic and connectional evidence supports parcellation of the OfC. The rostrally placed isocortical sector is mainly connected with isocortical areas, including sensory areas of the auditory, somatic and visual modalities, whereas the caudal non-isocortical sector is principally connected with non-isocortical areas, and, in the sensory domain, with olfactory and gustatory areas. The connections of the isocortical and non-isocortical orbital sectors with the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter are also specific. The medial sector of the OfC is selectively connected with the hippocampus. posterior parahippocampal cortex, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial areas, and area prostriata, while the lateral orbitofrontal sector is the most heavily connected with sensory areas of the gustatory, somatic and visual modalities, with premotor regions, and with the amygdala.;Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morphol, E-28029 Madrid, Spain;Autonomous University of Madrid;Cavada, C (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Med, Dept Morphol, Arzobispo MOrcillo S-N, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.;carmen.cavada@uam.es;"Tejedor, Jaime/G-7728-2015; Cavada, Carmen/L-4564-2013; Cruz-Rizzolo, Roelf J/E-4172-2012; Cavada, Carmen/AAG-7021-2020";"Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Cavada, Carmen/0000-0001-7230-1388; Tejedor Fraile, Jaime/0000-0001-5507-5622; Cruz-Rizzolo, Roelf/0000-0002-0920-0581";;;;;183;710;724;0;62;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

One of its subdivisions, the medial pulvinar, is connected to many cortical areas, including the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, as well as with multisensory areas and premotor areas. However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, 2 macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory, and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual, and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly suppressive (the audiovisual response is less than the strongest unisensory response) and subadditive (the audiovisual response is less than the sum of the auditory and the visual responses).

Infusions of lignocaine centered within VPLo caused hemiplegia during which movements of the contralateral arm rarely were performed in either task for a short period of time (similar to 5-30 min). When VT responses were produced, they had prolonged reaction times and movement times and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities compared with responses produced during the preinfusion baseline period. In contrast, those IG responses that were produced remained relatively normal. Infusions centered within area X never caused hemiplegia. The only deficits observed were an increase in reaction time and movement amplitude variability and a higher incidence of trajectory abnormalities during VT trials. Every other aspect of both the VT and IG movements remained unchanged. Infusions centered within VLo reduced the number of movements attempted during each block of trials. This did not appear to be due to hemiplegia, however, as voluntary movements easily could be elicited outside of the trained tasks. The other main deficit resulting from inactivation of VLo was an increased reaction time in the VT task. Finally, infusions centered within VApc caused IG movements to become slower and smaller in amplitude, whereas VT movements remained unchanged. Control infusions with saline did not cause any consistent deficits. This pattern of results implies that VPLo and VLo play a role in the production of movements in general regardless of the context under which they are performed. They also suggest that VPLo contributes more specifically to the execution of movements that are visually triggered and guided, whereas area X contributes specifically to the initiation of such movements. In contrast, VApc appears to play a role in the execution of movements based on internal cues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that specific subcircuits within the cerebello- and basal ganglio-thalamo-cortical systems preferentially contribute to movements based on external versus internal cues.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3PT, England";"University of Oxford; University of Oxford";van Donkelaar, P (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, 112C Esslinger Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;;Miall, R.

Connections in the mediolateral direction from core, to belt, to parabelt, have been well described, but less is known about the flow of information along the supratemporal plane (STP) in the caudorostral dimension. Neuroanatomical tracers were injected throughout the caudorostral extent of the auditory core and rostral STP by direct visualization of the cortical surface. Auditory cortical areas were distinguished by SMI-32 immunostaining for neurofilament, in addition to established cytoarchitectonic criteria. The results describe a pathway comprising step-wise projections from AI through the rostral and rostrotemporal fields of the core (R and RT), continuing to the recently identified rostrotemporal polar field (RTp) and the dorsal temporal pole. Each area was strongly and reciprocally connected with the areas immediately caudal and rostral to it, though deviations from strictly serial connectivity were observed. In RTp, inputs converged from core, belt, parabelt, and the auditory thalamus, as well as higher order cortical regions.

Here we demonstrate temporally induced elevation of visual responsiveness in cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cat and monkey following a period of high intensity (elevated contrast) stimulation. This augmentation is seen in 40-70% (monkey-cat) of cells tested and of all subtypes. Peaking at similar to 3 min following the period of intense stimulation, it can last for 10-12 min and can be repeated and summed in time. Furthermore, it is dependent on corticofugal input, is seen even when high contrast stimuli of orthogonal orientation are used and therefore results from a/any prior increase in activity in the retino-geniculo-striate pathway.

On the basis of its connectivity and physiology, this nucleus has been implicated in the control of saccadic eye movements, Because of the complexity of its afferent signals and its simple efferent signal, there must be much local interaction within the ZI to integrate these various afferents, The purpose of this study was to investigate, at the ultrastructural level, whether the ZI contains the anatomical substrata which could subserve the control of eye movements, Methods: Blocks of tissue from the ZI of macaque monkeys were prepared for electron microscopy using standard techniques. Some of these animals were taken specifically for electron microscopy, Others had received injections of tracer substances and were prepared for electron microscopy subsequent to tracer visualization, Results: Cell bodies of medium-large neurons were found in our preparations, They have large nucleoli and relatively small volumes of karyoplasm, Cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes have many synaptic contacts, Three types of synaptic profiles were found, designated Types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 profiles are symmetrical and contact cell bodies and small dendrites. Spe 2 profiles are thought to be presynaptic dendrites and may have symmetrical or asymmetrical contacts, Type 3 profiles are asymmetrical and primarily contact small dendrites, Many synapses contacted vesicle-containing profiles, In some cases, it was clear that these profiles participated in serial synapses on presumptive presynaptic dendrites, Other profiles appeared to be axoaxonic contacts, Conclusions: Afferent and efferent signals are Likely to be modulated extensively within the ZI. Therefore, there needs to be complex interactions between neuronal elements of the ZI and its afferents, This study demonstrates that this nucleus possesses the structural substrata to subserve diverse roles, such as the gating of saccadic eye movements.

This can follow from laterally directed connections in the local circuit at the level of the cell in question but could also involve more complex interactions. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the cells relaying the retinal input display a concentric, center surround organization that in part follows from the similar organization characterizing the retinal cells providing their input. However, local thalamic inhibitory interneurons also play a role, and as we examine here, feedback from the visual cortex too. Here, we show in the primate (macaque) that spatially organized cortical feedback provides a clear and differential influence serving to enhance both responses to stimulation within the center of the receptive field and the ability of the nonclassical surround mechanism to attenuate this. In short, both center and surround mechanisms are influenced by the feedback. This dynamically sharpens the spatial focus of the receptive field and introduces nonlinearities from the cortical mechanism into the LGN.;"[Jones, Helen E.; Andolina, Ian M.; Ahmed, Bashir; Shipp, Stewart D.; Clements, Jake T.

By using both passively and actively transported axonal tracers in fetal and postnatal ferrets, we have analyzed the development of projections from the cortex to a number of thalamic nuclei. We report that the projections of a cortical area to its corresponding thalamic nuclei follow highly cell-specific programs of development, Axons from cells in the deepest layers of the cerebral cortex (layer 6 and superficial subplate neurons) appear to grow very slowly and be delayed for several weeks in the cerebral white matter, reaching the thalamus over a protracted period, Neurons of layer 5, on the other hand, develop their projections much faster; despite being born after the neurons of deeper layers, layer 5 neurons are the first to extend their axons out of the cortical hemisphere and innervate the thalamus, Layer 5 projections are massive in the first postnatal weeks but may become partly eliminated later in development, being overtaken in number by layer 6 cells that constitute the major corticothalamic projection by adulthood. Layer 5 projections are area-specific from the outset and arise as collateral branches of axons directed to the brainstem and spinal cord. Our findings show that the early development of corticofugal connections is determined not by the sequence of cortical neurogenesis but by developmental programs specific for each type of projection neuron, In addition, they demonstrate that in most thalamic nuclei, layer 5 neurons (and not subplate or layer 6 neurons) establish the first descending projections from the cerebral cortex.";MIT,DEPT BRAIN & COGNIT SCI,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02139;Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT);;;Cabré, Francisco Clasca/AAR-9907-2021;Cabré, Francisco Clasca/0000-0003-0718-1337;;;;;37;57;58;0;2;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

Twelve right-handed, schizophrenic patients treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics and 6 healthy control subjects were studied with fMRI while performing a 2-back working memory task. Effective connectivity within a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for mnemonic information processing was assessed and compared between both groups. The path model included cortico-cortical connections comprising the parietal association cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as a cortico-cerebellar feedback loop comprising prefrontal cortex, contralateral cerebellum, and thalamus. Group differences were analyzed with a stacked models approach. Relative to normal controls, both patient groups revealed a pattern of reduced connectivity within the prefrontal-cerebellar and the cerebellar-thalamic limbs but enhanced connectivity in the thalamo-cortical limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuit. Moreover. a direct comparison of both treatment groups revealed enhanced connectivity in the interhemispheric connections between the cortical association areas in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. However, right prefrontal and left parieto-frontal path coefficients were lower in the patient group receiving atypical antispychotic drugs. The findings suggest that the relationship between pathology in cortical-subcortical cerebellar networks and associated functional connectivity is complex and may include aspects of increased and decreased levels of connectivity consistent with the notion of cognitive dysmetria in schizophrenia. The observed pronounced connectivity within thalamo-cortical projections could be attributed to a compensatory increase of thalamic input in the presence of disrupted effective connectivity within the preceding limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuitry. The study demonstrated the feasibility of structural equation modeling for the investigation of group and treatment-related differences in effective connectivity and provides a promising approach to further disentangle the relationship between altered functional capacity and associated fMRI signal changes.

Chronic and acute suppression of neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex resulted in a striking enlargement of receptive fields in the ventroposterior thalamus. This finding demonstrates a dramatic 'top-down' influence of cortex on receptive field size in the somatosensory thalamus. In addition, this result has important implications for studies of adult neuronal plasticity because it indicates that changes in 'higher-order' areas of the brain can trigger extensive changes in the receptive field characteristics of neurons located earlier in the processing pathway.;"Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA; Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA; Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Washington, DC 20057 USA";"Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Georgetown University";Pons, TP (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Winston Salem, NC 27127 USA.;tpons@wfubmc.edu;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH53369-02, MH11950-01] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS35246-01] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;25;126;126;1;5;NATURE AMERICA INC;NEW YORK;345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA;1097-6256;;;NAT NEUROSCI;Nat.

These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (''sensorimotor striatum'') and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (''associative striatum'') and the ventral striatum (''limbic striatum''), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.

The subjects actively stroked their fingertips over gratings that varied in groove width. Many cells in each location displayed average firing rates that incrementally reflected groove width dimensions (0.5-2.9 mm). Approximately 10% of cortical cells were more active to surfaces with narrower grooves, i.e., had negative graded response functions. All thalamic cells and similar to 50% of cortical cells with positive graded functions to gratings also showed increased responsiveness to contact force. Some cells also varied their activity with stroke speed. Many thalamic, a few primary somatosensory cortical cells, and no secondary somatosensory cortical cells showed periodic firing patterns that reflected the spatial-temporal frequency of stimulation. Responses to gratings of nearly every cell with negative graded responses and the remaining cortical cells with positive functions were independent of contact force and stroke velocity. The results only partially confirm predictions based on different models of texture perception that propose spatial, intensive, or cross modal neural codes. Negative graded response functions may require a form of spatial convergence across a cell's receptive field that has not previously been discussed by these models.;;;BURTON, H (corresponding author), WASHINGTON UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL,660 S EUCLID AVE,ST LOUIS,MO 63110, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS31005] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;40;18;18;0;1;NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA;OTTAWA;RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA;0008-4212;;;CAN J PHYSIOL PHARM;Can.

Recently, five separate neurochemical subdivisions of a region termed the inferior pulvinar (PI) complex were identified in monkeys. In the present study, similar histochemical procedures were applied to map the extent of the PI complex in humans. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and cytochrome oxidase staining demarcated four histochemical zones in human pulvinar, corresponding to the medial, central, lateral and lateral-shell (PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S) divisions of the PI complex in monkeys.

Here we show that the receptive fields of these cells differ in size and response latency but not at random. We have found that in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) the receptive field size and response latency of neighboring neurons are significantly correlated: the larger the receptive field, the faster the response to visual stimuli. This correlation is widespread in LGN. It is found in groups of cells belonging to the same type ( e. g., Y cells), and of different types (i.e., X and Y), within a specific layer or across different layers. These results indicate that the inputs from the multiple geniculate afferents that converge onto a cortical cell ( approximately 30) are likely to arrive in a sequence determined by the receptive field size of the geniculate afferents. Recent studies have shown that the peak of the spatial frequency tuning of a cortical cell shifts toward higher frequencies as the response progresses in time. Our results are consistent with the idea that these shifts in spatial frequency tuning arise from differences in the response time course of the thalamic inputs.;"SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry; University of Connecticut";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol Sci, 33 W 42nd St, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;YEH, CHUN-I/0000-0002-2375-0723;NEI NIH HHS [EY-05253] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;44;31;31;0;8;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Projection neurons were mostly medium-sized, with oval-fusiform or polygonal perikarya, few primary dendrites, and frequent somatic spines; local circuit neurons were smaller. Four basic types of synaptic boutons were distinguished: (1) Small- to medium-sized boutons containing round vesicles (SR) and forming asymmetric contacts, identified as corticothalamic terminals. (2) Heterogeneous medium-sized boutons with asymmetric contacts and round vesicles, similar to the so-called large round (LR) boutons, which were in part of cortical origin. (3) Heterogeneous CAD-positive small- to medium-sized boutons, containing pleomorphic vesicles and forming symmetric contacts (F1 type), which included pallidothalamic terminals. (4) Presynaptic profiles represented by CAD-positive vesicle-containing dendrites of local circuit neurons. Complex synaptic arrangements, serial synapses and triads with LR and SR boutons engaging all parts of projection neuron dendrites and somata, were seen consistently, whereas classical glomeruli were infrequent. LR and SR boutons also established synapses on dendrites of local circuit neurons. Fl boutons established synapses on projection neuron somata, dendrites and initial axon segments. Compared to other previously studied motor-related thalamic nuclei, differences in synaptic coverage between proximal and distal projection neuron dendrites were less pronounced, and the density of synapses formed by local circuit dendrites on projection neuron dendrites was lower. Thus, compared to other thalamic nuclei, the overlap of different inputs was higher on monkey centromedian cells, and centromedian inhibitory circuits displayed a different organization.";"UNIV VERONA, INST ANAT & HISTOL, I-37100 VERONA, ITALY; UNIV IOWA, DEPT ANAT, IOWA CITY, IA USA";"University of Verona; University of Iowa";;;Bentivoglio, Marina/K-1008-2016;Bentivoglio, Marina/0000-0003-4958-9795;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS24188] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;69;17;18;0;0;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0300-4864;;;J NEUROCYTOL;J.

Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [ suppression index (SI) > 0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast.

Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MTC were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIP; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MTC to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MTC had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MTC to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups.

The centromedian (centre median, CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei are an important source of thalamostriatal projections. Anterograde tract-tracing indicates the CM-Pf complex provides dense afferents to the matrix compartment of the striatum. Whereas CM projects to the entire sensorimotor territory of the striatum, the Pf provides complementary input to the entire associative sector. The Pf also provides lighter input to the nucleus accumbens. Both CM and Pf provide light to moderately dense inputs to other components of the basal ganglia in a largely complementary manner, covering motor or associative-limbic territories of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral midbrain. In turn, the CM and Pf receive mainly segregated input from parallel motor and associative-limbic circuits of the basal ganglia. The CM and Pf may therefore be considered important participants in parallel processing of motor and associative-limbic information in the basal ganglia. Connections of the CM and Pf with other thalamic nuclei suggest they also participate in integrative functions within the thalamus. In addition, inputs from the brainstem reticular core, reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex and reticular thalamic nucleus suggest a role in state-dependant information processing. Consideration of the differential connections of the CM and Pf, and better understanding of their role in pathophysiology, may eventually lead to development of an important new target for relief of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

[C-11]CB-119 was synthesized with high specific activity by alkylation of a phenolic precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. In vitro autoradiographic studies using rhesus brain slices were carried out using [H-3]CB-119, and in vivo imaging studies were carried out using [C-11]CB-119 in rhesus monkeys under baseline and blocked conditions. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus brain showed the expected distribution pattern for CB1R with highest binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Lower binding was seen in the posterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and periventricular gray area, and the lowest binding was in the thalamic nuclei. The binding of [H-3]CB-119 was fully blocked by the addition of 10 mu M CB-119. Rhesus positron emission tomography imaging studies showed very good brain uptake and a distribution pattern consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. The kinetics of tracer uptake was slow. The brain uptake was blocked by pretreatment with taranabant, a CB1R inverse agonist. The specific signal (total/nonspecific) in rhesus putamen at 90 min was similar to 6:1.

Whether functional connections between CG neurons and LGN relay neurons obey or ignore the separation of feedforward visual signals into parallel processing streams is not known. Accordingly, there is some debate about whether CG neurons are morphologically heterogeneous or homogenous. Here we characterized the morphology of CG neurons in the ferret, a visual carnivore with distinct feedforward parallel processing streams, and compared the morphology of ferret CG neurons with CG neuronal morphology previously described in macaque monkeys [Briggs et al. (2016) Neuron, 90, 388]. We used a G-deleted rabies virus as a retrograde tracer to label CG neurons in adult ferrets. We then reconstructed complete dendritic morphologies for a large sample of virus-labeled CG neurons. Quantification of CG morphology revealed three distinct CG neuronal subtypes with striking similarities to the CG neuronal subtypes observed in macaques. These findings suggest that CG neurons may be morphologically diverse in a variety of highly visual mammals in which feedforward visual pathways are organized into parallel processing streams. Accordingly, these results provide support for the notion that CG feedback is functionally parallel stream-specific in ferrets and macaques.;"[Hasse, J.

We addressed this issue by investigating pathways in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from the amygdala to pOFC at the level of the system and synapse. Terminations from the amygdala were denser and larger in pOFC compared with the anterior cingulate cortex, which is also strongly connected with the amygdala. Axons from the amygdala terminated most densely in the upper layers of pOFC through large terminals. Most of these terminals innervated spines of presumed excitatory neurons and many were frequently multisynaptic and perforated, suggesting high synaptic efficacy. These amygdalar synapses in pOFC exceeded in size and specialization even thalamocortical terminals from the prefrontal-related thalamic mediodorsal nucleus to the middle cortical layers, which are thought to be highly efficient drivers of cortical neurons. Pathway terminals in the upper layers impinge on the apical dendrites of neurons in other layers, suggesting that the robust amygdalar projections may also activate neurons in layer 5 that project back to the amygdala and beyond to autonomic structures. Among inhibitory neurons, the amygdalar pathway innervated preferentially the neurochemical classes of calbindin and calretinin neurons in the upper layers of pOFC, which are synaptically suited to suppress noise and enhance signals. These features provide a circuit mechanism for flexibly shifting focus and adjusting emotional drive in processes disrupted in psychiatric disorders, such as phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder.;"[Timbie, Clare; Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Barbas, Helen] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA";"Boston University; Boston University";Barbas, H (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Neural Syst Lab, 635 Commonwealth Ave,Room 443A, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;barbas@bu.edu;;Barbas, Helen/0000-0003-0825-0832;"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health, National Research Service Award) [F30MH093002]; National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health) [R01MH057414]; National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant) [R01NS024760]; Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology; National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (National Science Foundation) [OMA-0835976]";"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health, National Research Service Award); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant); Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology; National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (National Science Foundation)";"This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health, National Research Service Award F30MH093002, C.T.; National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01MH057414 and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant R01NS024760, H.B.) and Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center (National Science Foundation Grant OMA-0835976).

Tactile allodynia, in which innocuous tactile stimuli are perceived as painful, is common in patients with CPSP. Previous brain imaging studies have reported plastic changes in brain activity in patients with tactile allodynia after stroke, but a causal relationship between such changes and the symptoms has not been established. We recently developed a non-human primate (macaque) model of CPSP based on thalamic lesions, in which the animals show behavioral changes consistent with the occurrence of tactile allodynia. Here we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging under propofol anesthesia to investigate the changes in brain activation associated with the allodynia in this CPSP model. Before the lesion, innocuous tactile stimuli significantly activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. When behavioral changes were observed after the thalamic lesion, equivalent stimuli significantly activated pain-related brain areas, including the posterior insular cortex (PIC), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Moreover, when either PIC/SII or ACC was pharmacologically inactivated, the signs of tactile allodynia were dampened. Our results show that increased cortical activity plays a role in CPSP-induced allodynia.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, 5-3-1 Koujimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Kita Ku, 1398 Shimami, Niigata, Niigata 9503198, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tsukuba; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Niigata University";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016; Higo, Noriyuki/M-6385-2016";"Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316; Higo, Noriyuki/0000-0002-3448-1696";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants [25351004, 16K01489]; MEXT of Japan [17H05917, 17J03104]; PRESTO of Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25351004, 17H05917, 16K01489, 17J03104] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants; MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); PRESTO of Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";We are grateful to Mr. T.

The goal of the study was to evaluate a high affinity and high selectivity antagonist, [C-11]P943, as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the 5-HT1B receptor. [C-11]P943 was synthesized via N-methylation of the precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide or [C-11]methyl triflate using automated modules. The average radiochemical yield was approx. 10% with radiochemical purity of >99% and specific activity of 8.8 +/- 3.6 mCi/nmol at the end-of-synthesis (n=37). PET imaging was performed in non-human primates with a high-resolution research tomograph scanner with a bolus/infusion paradigm. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the equilibrium ratios of regions to cerebellum. The tracer uptake was highest in the globus pallidus and occipital cortex, moderate in basal ganglia and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum, which is consistent with the known brain distribution of 5-HT1B receptors. Infusion of tracer at different specific activities (by adding various amount of unlabeled P943) reduced BPND values in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the saturability of the tracer binding. Blocking studies with GR127935 (2 mg/kg iv), a selective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D antagonist, resulted in reduction of BPND values by 42-95% across regions; for an example, in occipital region from 0.71 to 0.03, indicating a complete blockade. These results demonstrate the saturability and specificity of [C-11]P943 for 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting its suitability as a PET radiotracer for in vivo evaluations of the 5-HT1B receptor system in humans.

Using three-dimensional reconstructions of electron microscopic images, we quantitatively characterize a GABAergic pathway that establishes synaptic contacts exclusively via multiple synapses. Axon terminals of the nigrothalamic pathway formed, on average, 8.5 synapses on large-diameter dendrites and somata of relay cells in the ventromedial nucleus of the rat thalamus. All synapses of a given terminal converged on a single postsynaptic element. The vast majority of the synapses established by a single terminal were not separated by astrocytic processes. Nigrothalamic terminals in the macaque monkey showed the same ultrastructural features both in qualitative and quantitative terms (the median number of synapse per target was also 8.5). The individual synapses were closely spaced in both species. The nearest-neighbor synaptic distances were 169 nm in the rat and 178 nm in the monkey. The average number of synapses within 0.75 mu m from any given synapse was 3.8 in the rat and 3.5 in the monkey. The arrangement of synapses described in this study creates favorable conditions for intersynaptic spillover of GABA among the multiple synapses of a single bouton, which can result in larger charge transfer. This could explain faithful and efficient GABAergic signal transmission in the nigrothalamic pathway in the healthy condition and during Parkinson's disease. In addition, our structural data suggest that the rodent nigrothalamic pathway can be a valid model of the primate condition, when the mechanism of GABAergic transmission is studied.;"[Bodor, Agnes L.; Giber, Kristof; Rovo, Zita; Acsady, Laszlo] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Dept Cellular & Network Neurobiol, H-1450 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Physiol, H-1068 Budapest, Hungary; [Ulbert, Istvan] Peter Pazmany Catholic Univ, Dept Informat Technol, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary";"Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Institute of Experimental Medicine; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Pazmany Peter Catholic University";Acsady, L (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Expt Med, Szigony U 43, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.;acsady@koki.hu;"Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010; Acsady, Laszlo/C-7773-2014";Acsady, Laszlo/0000-0002-0679-2980;Wellcome Trust [067573] Funding Source: Medline;Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);;;65;51;51;0;7;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We reported previously how the anlage of the retrosplenial cortex merges with the immature presubicular zone in the fetal rhesus monkey at the end of the first trimester of gestation. In the present study, this caudal area was further defined on a chemoarchitectonic basis, particularly during the late prenatal and perinatal stages, which correspond to the development of the cingulate sulcus and temporal gyri, and the differentiation of the retrosplenial/subicular complex. Neurotensin (NT), a pyramidal cell marker in the limbic cortex, and parvalbumin (PV), a marker of a subset of inhibitory local circuit neurons in the hippocampal formation, were used as immunocytochemical markers. According to distinct chemoarchitectural patterns, (1) areas 29l and 29m of the retrosplenial cortex formed a triangle-shaped ventral expansion which merged with a similar but dorsal expansion of the pre/parasubicular fields. A temporal extension of area 29m down to area TH could not be detected. The pre/parasubiculum contributed with area 29m to the lateral bank of the calcarine sulcus as far as the most caudal extent of the hippocampal formation. (2) The lamina principalis interna of the presubiculum was well individualized and did not appear as a simple horizontal shift of adjoining fields. (3) NT and PV displayed a distinct temporal profile of development. NT was already expressed in the pyramidal cells of the prospective retrosplenial cortex and ventral hippocampal formation at E47 (term 165 days). Major pathways of the hippocampal formation and retrosplenial cortex (fimbria, fornix, angular and cingulum bundles) were progressively labeled indicating early developing projections. A large set of NT-positive afferents reached the retrosplenial cortex between E114 and E120. Their laminar distribution was compatible with a thalamic or a subicular origin. (4) The development of PV expression was delayed until the last quarter of gestation, supporting its proposal as a signal of functional onset. The developmental fate and the particular connections of the presubiculum suggest that its functional importance should be further investigated during infancy and adulthood.

For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.;"[Najafian, Sohrab; Jin, Jianzhong; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Biol & Visual Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;;Najafian, Sharareh/0000-0001-6441-9693;National Institutes of Health [EY027361];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant EY027361.;;58;7;7;1;10;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;1529-2401;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We find that, in the retina, alphaCamKII expression also differentiates two primary groups of ganglion cell, both characterized by broad, sparsely branching dendritic trees and cell bodies intermediate in size between the parvo- and magnocellular-projecting ganglion cells. Cells in the first group have three or four primary dendrites, a thick axon, and a rounded cell body and likely are made up of multiple types. In contrast, ganglion cells in the second group demonstrate a highly regular morphology, with strictly two primary dendrites and a thinner axon emanating from a smaller, elliptical cell body. This cell resembles the large sparse ganglion cell identified by others in retrograde labeling from the LGN and represents about 2% of all ganglion cells. In the optic nerve, alphaCamKII+ axons are also intermediate in size and form a bimodal distribution, correlating with the axonal sizes of the two groups of ganglion cell. For the LGN, we describe a group of aCamKII+ axon terminals with morphology consistent with terminals from retinal ganglion cells. These terminals form long, filamentous contacts with aCamKII+ relay cells and increase in frequency from the dorsal to the ventral koniocellular regions. Our results indicate that ganglion cells expressing aCamKII represent multiple projections to the brain, at least one of which provides input to one or more koniocellular regions of the LGN.

Loss of neurons has been reported in the cerebral cortex following immunodeficiency viral infection. but thalamic structures which may contribute to electrophysiological changes and neurological deficits have not been examined. In this study, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaques inoculated with macrophage-tropic, neurovirulent virus SIV(mac)239 (R71 and 17E) was examined for neuron loss using the optical fractionator method. Estimates of the number of neurons in the P layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus of age-matched control macaques ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 x 10(6), while the number of neurons in SIV infected macaques ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 x 10(6), reflecting neuron loss of up to 28%.

Loss of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus was correlated with the pattern of neuropathological changes.

It may therefore be difficult to translate the results to the clinical situations. In the present study, the detailed change of NET occupancy was investigated among a wider range of doses in a more advanced manner. Two rhesus monkeys were examined using a high-resolution PET system with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 under baseline conditions and after steady-state infusion of different doses of atomoxetine (0.003 to 0.12 mg/kg per hour). NET occupancy of the thalamus, brainstem and anterior cingulate cortex was calculated using BPND obtained with the simplified reference tissue model. NET occupancy increased regionally and uniformly as the plasma concentration of atomoxetine increased. The estimated Kd value (the amount to occupy 50% of NET) in the thalamus was 16 ng/ml.

We have recorded single-neuron activities from the MD nucleus in monkeys trained to perform spatial tasks with peripheral visual stimuli and a nonspatial task with foveally presented pictures of objects and faces-tasks identical to those we have previously used to map regional specializations in the dorso- and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. We found that MD neurons exhibited categorical specificity-either responding selectively to locations in the spatial tasks or preferentially to specific representations of faces and objects in the nonspatial task. Spatially tuned neurons were located in parts of the MD connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while neurons responding to the identity of stimuli mainly occupied more ventral positions in the nucleus that has its connections with the inferior prefrontal convexity. Neuronal responses to auditory stimuli were also examined, and vocalization sensitive neurons were found in more posterior portions of the MD.

In this study, we examined the timing and occurrence of perisaccadic modulation of LGN single-unit activity in awake-behaving macaque monkeys while they made spontaneous saccades in the dark and made visually guided saccades to discrete stimuli located outside the receptive field. Our hypothesis was that the activity of LGN cells is modulated by efference copies of motor plans to produce saccadic eye movements and that this modulation depends neither on the presence of feedforward visual information nor on a corollary discharge of signals directing saccadic eye movements. On average, 25% of LGN cells demonstrated significant perisaccadic modulation. This modulation consisted of a moderate suppression of activity that began more than 100 ms prior to the initiation of a saccadic eye movement and continued beyond the termination of the saccadic eye movement. This suppression was followed by a large enhancement of activity after the eyes arrived at the next fixation. Although members of all three LGN relay cell classes (magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular) demonstrated significant saccade-related suppression and enhancement of activity, more cells demonstrated postsaccadic enhancement (25%) than perisaccadic suppression (17%). In no case did the timing of the modulation coincide directly with saccade duration. The degree of modulation observed did not vary with LGN cell class, LGN receptive field center location, center sign (ON-center or OFF-center), or saccade latency or velocity. The time course of modulation did, however, vary with saccade size such that suppression was longer for longer saccades. The fact that activity from a percentage of LGN cells from all cell classes was modulated in relationship to saccadic eye movements in the absence of direct visual stimulation suggests that this modulation is a general phenomenon not tied to specific types of visual stimuli. Similarly, because the onset of the modulation preceded eye movements by more than 100 ms, it is likely that this modulation reflects higher order motor-planning rather than a corollary of mechanisms in direct control of eye movements themselves. Finally, the fact that the largest modulation is a postsaccadic enhancement of activity may suggest that perisaccadic modulations are designed more for the facilitation of visual information processing once the eyes land at a new location than for filtering unwanted visual stimuli.;"Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Mol Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Med Ctr N,U3218, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Integrat & Cognit Neurosci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Res Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; Univ Szeged, Dept Physiol, Szeged, Hungary";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Szeged University";Casagrande, VA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.;vivien.casagrande@vanderbilt.edu;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY08890, EY01778, EY08126] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHS [HD15052] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [1F31NS44691] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;59;44;44;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

It is considered to be a major component of the limbic system and has been shown to subserve a wide range of autonomic and somatic motor functions. The anterior and posterior regions of the cingulate cortex can be differentiated according to their thalamic afferents as well as their patterns of corticocortical connectivity. The primate cingulate cortex is traditionally divided into a series of cytoarchitectonic zones that can be distinguished along a ventral-dorsal axis of differentiation in both the anterior (areas 25, 24a, 24b, and 24c), and posterior (areas 29, 30, 23a, 23b, and 23c) regions. However, little is known about the precise cellular organization of these subareas. In the present study, we attempt to define the neuronal morphological and biochemical composition of the different cingulate cortex subareas, using antibodies to the neurofilament triplet protein and calcium-binding proteins. Results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the structure and functions of the cingulate cortex and the immunostaining patterns. For instance, distribution of neurofilament-rich pyramidal neurons parallels that of specific corticocortical and corticosubcortical systems and is a useful marker to delineate the cingulate motor area. Calcium-binding protein-containing neurons display a high degree of regional and laminar specialization. In particular, parvalbumin-positive interneurons are codistributed with neurofilament-immunoreactive pyramidal cells along the ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal axes of the cingulate cortex. Calbindin- and calretinin-positive immunostaining show more monotonous laminar and regional patterns, although they exhibit a particular labeling in area 29 that may correspond to the termination of select thalamocortical afferents. These chemoarchitectural patterns of regional and laminar neuronal specialization may be envisioned as the reflection of the richness of cortical diversity in the cingulate gyrus, and make it an ideal place to explore the interplay of the distributions of various neuron types in cortical areas of known function.;"CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED, DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV, NEW YORK, NY 10029 USA";"City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai";;;Nimchinsky, Esther/GXF-5277-2022;;;;;;74;79;79;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Projections from the dentate and IA nuclei overlap in central parts of the body of RTP, but the terminal field of dentate axons extends dorsomedial and rostral to the terminal field of IA axons, and I4 terminal fields extend more ventrolaterally. A caudal to rostral topography of projections from each nucleus onto dorsal to ventral parts of RTP was seen. Projections from rostral parts of both nuclei terminate in a sublemniscal part of the nucleus. The topography of dentate and IA projections onto central to ventrolateral RTP appears to match somatotopic maps of these cerebellar nuclei with the somatotopic map of projections to RTP from primary motor cortex. Projections from caudal and ventral parts of the dentate nucleus appear to overlap oculomotor inputs to rostral, dorsal, and medial RTP from the frontal and supplementary eye fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor region of the caudal fastigial nucleus. Projections to the paramedian part of RTP from vestibular area y were also found in two cases that correlated with projections to vertical oculomotor motoneurons. The maps of dentate and IA projections onto RTP correlate predictably with maps of dentate and IA projections to the ventrolateral thalamus and subnuclei of the red nucleus that were made from these same cases (Stanton [1980b] J.

However, the relative extent of both representations is subject to considerable species variation. The present study employed microelectrode mapping and anatomical tracing to investigate the location and extent of the ipsilateral representation in area 3b of the somatosensory cortex of squirrel monkeys. A small region, approximately 2 mm(2), was found to be responsive to stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. This region was located on the anteromedial border of area 3b, surrounded by the representation of the contralateral roof of the mouth. This region corresponded to areas of intense anterograde labeling following injections placed in the ventromedial portion of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus at the only sites where neural responses could be elicited by stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. The amount of thalamus and cortex given over to the ipsilateral representation in the squirrel monkey is small compared with that of the macaque monkey. This difference may be related to the lack of cheek pouches in the squirrel monkey, and therefore a different strategy for eating. The representation of the contralateral lower lip in area 3b was split by the representation of the contralateral upper lip. This split representation is in agreement with previous studies of the trigeminal representation in area 3b of the macaque monkey and may be a general feature of the representation of the trigeminal nerve in area 3b of primate cerebral cortex.

The caudomedial area, by contrast, receives input from MGv only indirectly via Al, and neurons in this area are often tuned to the spatial location of a complex sound. The belt areas on the lateral surface of the superior temporal gyrus receive input from the primary areas. Neurons in these areas respond better to more complex stimuli, such as band-pass noise pulses of frequency-modulated sweeps, than to pure tones. Often neurons in the lateral belt respond well to species-specific communication calls. The hypothesis is put forward that the central auditory pathways in the macaque monkey are organized into parallel streams, similar to the visual system, one for the processing of spatial information, the other for the processing of auditory 'patterns'. Evidence from neuroimaging studies in humans with MRI and PET are consistent with this hypothesis.

The brainstem and the thalamus were devoid of immunostained cell bodies, whereas in the hypothalamus immunopositive perikarya were observed in the supraoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamus, the preoptic region and in the arcuate nucleus. Our findings also showed that the hypothalamus is richer in immunostained fibres, and that in this region such fibres are more widely distributed than in the thalamus and upper brainstem. No immunopositive fibres were observed in the lower brainstem. Our results point to a more widespread distribution of LH-RH-immunostained perikarya in the cat hypothalamus than that previously reported in the cat; a similar distribution to that found in the rat, and a more restricted distribution than in primates. Additionally, our study shows a more widespread distribution of immunostained fibres in the cat brainstem and diencephalon than that previously described for other mammals. In this context, our results describe for the first time in the mammals central nervous system fibres containing LH-RH located in the stria medullaris of the thalamus, the supra mammillary decussation, the laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, the supraoptic nucleus, and the optic chiasm. Thus, our findings reveal that LH-RH-immunostained structures are widely distributed in the upper brainstem and in the diencephalon of the cat, suggesting that the peptide may be involved in several physiological functions.

This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.;"[Buckner, Randy L.; DiNicola, Lauren M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.; DiNicola, Lauren M.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Buckner, Randy L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";"Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA.;Buckner, RL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA.";randy_buckner@harvard.edu;;Buckner, Randy/0000-0001-6422-8037;"US National Institutes of Health [P50MH106435]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE1745303]";"US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))";The authors thank J.

The HRP was placed from 3 to 5 mm caudal to the descending columns of the fornix. Additional information came from a series of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasciculata) with anterograde tracer injections in the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum, together with the entorhinal cortex (EC) and perirhinal cortex (area 35) contribute numerous axons to the fornix in a topographical manner. In contrast, the lateral perirhinal cortex (area 36) and parahippocampal cortical areas TF and TH only contained a handful of cells labeled via the fornix. The medial fornix originates from cells in the caudal half of the subiculum, the lamina principalis interna of the caudal half of the presubiculum, and from the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The intermediate portion of the fornix (i.e., that part midway between the midline and most lateral parts of the fornix) originates from cells in the rostral half of the subiculum and prosubiculum, the anterior presubiculum (only from the lamina principalis externa), the caudal presubiculum (primarily from lamina principalis interna), the rostral half of CA3, the EC (primarily 28I and 28M), and the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The lateral parts of the fornix arise from the rostral EC (28L only) and the most rostral portion of CA3. Subcortically, the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the thalamic nucleus reuniens all send projections through the fornix, which presumably terminate in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal region. These results not only help to define those regions that project via the fornix, but also reveal those subcortical projections to the hippocampal formation most likely to rely entirely on nonfornical pathways.;"NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff, Wales";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Cardiff University";Saunders, RC (corresponding author), NIMH, Lab Neuropsychol, 49 Convent Rd, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;richardsaunders@mail.nih.gov;;Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308;;;;;76;92;93;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1050-9631;1098-1063;;HIPPOCAMPUS;Hippocampus;;2007;17;5;;;;;396;411;;10.1002/hipo.20276;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20276;;;16;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;164EN;17372974;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000246216400007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, we have demonstrated that JC virus can infect cerebellar granule cell neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons in immunosuppressed people. To examine whether SV40 neuronal infection occurs spontaneously in immunosuppressed macaques, we analyzed archival brain specimens from 20 simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus with AIDS and 1 cynomolgus post-transplant selected with SV40 brain infection from archival records from 1991 to 2012. In addition to white matter SV40 distribution in classic demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, some of the 21 monkeys exhibited meningeal, subpial neocortical, and periventricular virus. This distribution pattern corresponded to broader viral tropism with neuronal infection in 14 (66.7%) of 21 cases. In all 14 cases, identified neurons were positive for early SV40 transcript large T antigen, but only 4 of the 14 cases exhibited Late viral transcript viral protein 1-positive neurons. SV40-infected neurons were detected in frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and brain stem. These observations confirm that spontaneous 5V40 neuronal infection occurs in immunosuppressed macaques, which parallels JC virus-neuronal infection in immunosuppressed patients. Neuronal infection may be an important aspect of both SV40 and JC virus neuropathogenesis in their respective hosts.;"[Kaliyaperumal, Saravanan; Knight, Heather L.; Pearson, Christine; MacKey, John; Westmoreland, Susan V.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Dept Comparat Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; [Dang, Xin; Wuethrich, Christian; Koralnik, Igor J.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Div NeuroVirol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mansfield, Keith G.] Novartis, Cambridge, MA USA";"Harvard University; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Novartis";Westmoreland, SV (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, New England Primate Res Ctr, Div Comparat Pathol, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.;susan_westmoreland@hms.harvard.edu;;;"NIH [T32 OD011064]; New England Primate Research Center Base grant [P51OD011103-51]";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); New England Primate Research Center Base grant";Supported by NIH grant T32 OD011064 (S.V.W.) and New England Primate Research Center Base grant P51OD011103-51.;;27;15;16;0;4;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;0002-9440;1525-2191;;AM J PATHOL;Am.

In the present study, adult pig-tailed macaques were infected with a highly neuropathogenic virus SIVsmmFGb. MT imaging was exploited to examine the monkey brains before simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks post-SIV inoculation. Blood samples were collected from each animal for monitoring CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells before each MRI scan. The MT ratios (MTR) in several brain regions of interest were evaluated longitudinally. Significant reductions of MTR were observed in whole brain and selected regions of interest (genu, splenium, thalamus, caudate, centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, frontal gray matter, and putamen) in the SIV-infected monkeys, consistent with those reported previously in HIV patients. In particular, the longitudinal results indicate that abnormal MTR reduction can be detected as early as in 2 weeks and MTR may be more sensitive to the brain injury in cortical regions than in subcortical regions during acute SIV infection. In addition, MTR reduction in genu, centrum semiovale, and thalamus significantly correlated with the CD4(+) T cell percentage decrease. Also, the MTR reduction in thalamus correlated with the CD8(+) T cell percentage elevation. Taken together, this study reported the longitudinal evolution of MTR in different brain regions during SIV infection and further validates previous findings in HIV patients. The preliminary results suggest that MT imaging could be a robust and sensitive approach to characterize the neurodegeneration after SIV or HIV infection.;"[Li, Chun-Xia; Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Yerkes Imaging Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Herndon, James G.; Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neuropharmacol & Neurol Dis, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Novembre, Francis J.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Microbiol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Novembre, Francis J.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Immunol, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA";"Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University";Zhang, XD (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.;xzhang8@emory.edu;;;"National Center for Research Resources [P51RR000165]; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD [P51OD011132]; NIH [MH067769]";"National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University.

The main efferent projections from the globus pallidus are to the subthalamus, to the thalamus, and to the substantia nigra. Although these projections have been well established for the dorsal pallidum, the projections of the ventral pallidum have not been explored in primates. The results of this study add an important link in how information from the limbic lobe is channeled through the basal ganglia in monkeys. Anterograde tracers, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, and tritiated amino acids were injected into various regions of the ventral pallidum. The descending efferent projection from the ventral pallidum in monkeys terminates primarily in the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamus, in the substantia nigra, and in the lateral habenular nucleus. Although terminals are also found in the thalamus, these are relatively sparse. The projections to the subthalamic nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus are topographically arranged, while those to the substantia nigra are not. These results suggest that pathways from distinct pallidal regions that receive specific striatal input terminate in distinct regions of the subthalamic/hypothalamic regions, thus maintaining a topographic arrangement. Projections to the substantia nigra, however, overlap extensively, suggesting convergence of terminals from different ventral pallidal regions. The relatively small projection to the thalamus raises the question that without a prominent thalamic projection, is this system parallel to that described for the dorsal globus pallidus?;"VET ADM MED CTR,RES SERV,SYRACUSE,NY 13210; SUNY HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT PHYSIOL,SYRACUSE,NY 13210";"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center";HABER, SN (corresponding author), UNIV ROCHESTER,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL & ANAT,601 ELMWOOD AVE,ROCHESTER,NY 14642, USA.;;;;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH 45573] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS22511] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;66;154;154;0;4;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Following dopaminergic denervation, pallidothalamic-projecting neurons are known to be hyperactive, whereas a reduction in GPi activity is typically observed in lesioned animals showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Besides the mRNAs coding for GABAergic markers (GAD65 and GAD67), we show that all GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets also express transcripts for the isoforms 1 and 2 of the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNA). Indeed, dual immunofluorescent detection of GAD67 and vGlut1/2 confirmed the data gathered from in situ hybridization experiments, therefore demonstrating that the detected mRNAs are translated into the related proteins. Furthermore, the dopaminergic lesion resulted in an up-regulation of expression levels for both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA within identified pallidothalamic-projecting neurons. This was coupled with a down-regulation of GAD65/67 mRNA expression levels in GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets in monkeys showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. By contrast, the patterns of gene expression for both vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNAs remained unchanged across GPi projection neurons in control, MPTP-treated and dyskinetic monkeys. In summary, both GABAergic and glutamatergic markers were co-expressed by GPi efferent neurons in primates.

However, some studies have demonstrated projections from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamic nuclei to the striatum, suggesting that these nuclei directly modulate the striatum. VA/VL nuclei have specific connections with primary, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor cortices indicating their involvement in motor function. These areas mediate different aspects of motor control such as movement execution, motor learning, and sensorimotor integration. Increasing evidence indicates that functionally related motor areas have convergent projections to the dorsal striatum, suggesting that integration of different aspects of motor control occur at the level of the striatum. This study examines the organization of VA/VL thalamic inputs to the dorsal motor striatum to determine how this afferent projection is organized with respect to corticostriatal afferents from motor, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Motor cortical projections to specific dorsal striatal regions arose from multiple areas, including components from primary motor, premotor, supplementary, and cingulate motor areas. Diverse motor cortical projections to a given dorsal striatal region indicated convergence of functionally related corticostriatal motor pathways. Most dorsal striatal sites received dense thalamic inputs from the VL pars oralis nucleus. Additional thalamostriatal projections arose from VA, VL pars caudalis, and ventral posterior lateral pars oralis nuclei and Olszewski's Area X. Our results provide evidence for convergent striatal projections from interconnected ventral thalamic and cortical motor areas, suggesting that these afferents modulate the same striatal output circuits.;Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Rochester, NY 14642 USA;University of Rochester;Haber, SN (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, 601 Elmwood Ave,Box 603, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;suzanne_haber@urmc.rochester.edu;McFarland, Nikolaus R/I-4209-2017;McFarland, Nikolaus R/0000-0002-8699-8857;"NIMH NIH HHS [F31 MH011661, MH11661] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS22511, R01 NS022511] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;92;168;169;0;11;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

The two principal tactile processing areas in the cerebral cortex, somatosensory areas I and II, receive direct projections from the thalamus and, as well, are linked through intracortical reciprocal connections. Tactile information may therefore be conveyed to SII, for example, over either a direct path from the thalamus or an indirect, or serial, path from the thalamus via SI. 2. Reports in recent years that tactile responsiveness within the hand area of SII was abolished by surgical ablation of the hand area of the postcentral, or SI, area of cortex in the macaque and marmoset monkeys indicated that a serial processing scheme may operate, at least in primates. However, as the surgical ablation is clearly irreversible and precludes examination of individual SII neurons in both the control and test circumstances, that is, when SI is intact and when it is inactivated, we have examined in the cat, the rabbit and the marmoset monkey the behaviour of SII neurons before, during and after the selective, rapidly-reversible inactivation of SI by means of localized cooling. 3. The results demonstrate that in the cat and rabbit, SII responsiveness is never abolished and infrequently affected by SI inactivation and that tactile inputs to SII therefore traverse a direct path from thalamus, organized in parallel with that to SI. In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), in contrast to earlier studies based on ablation of SI we found that with reversible inactivation of SI, SII responsiveness was unaffected in 25% of neurons and, although reduced in the remainder, was rarely abolished (<10% of SII neurons). 4. The results indicate that there is substantial direct thalamic input to SII, even in this simian primate, and therefore necessitate revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII.;;;Rowe, MJ (corresponding author), UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY,NSW 2052,AUSTRALIA.;;;;;;;;30;37;37;0;2;BLACKWELL SCIENCE;CARLTON;54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA;0305-1870;;;CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P;Clin.

The labelings by [H-3]nicotine, [H-3]cytisine, and [H-3]epibatidine were highly concordant, except for epibatidine. Layer IV of some cortical areas, most thalamic nuclei, and presubiculum displayed high levels of labeling for the three ligands. Moderate levels of binding were detected in the subiculum, the septum, and the mesencephalon. Low levels were present in layers I-II and VI of the cortex, the cornu Ammonis, the dentate gyrus, and the amygdala. In addition, the level of epibatidine labeling was very high in the epithalamic nuclei and the interpeduncular nucleus, whereas labeling by nicotine and cytisine was very weak in the same regions. The distribution of [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin binding differed from the binding of the three agonists. The labeling was dense in layer I of most cortical areas, dentate gyrus, stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 field, several thalamic nuclei, and medial habenula. A moderate labeling was found in layers V and VI of the prefrontal and frontal cortices, layer IV of primary visual cortex, amygdala, septum, hypothalamus, and some mesencenphalic nuclei. A weak signal was also detected in subiculum, claustrum, stratum oriens, and stratum lucidum of cornu Ammonis and also in some mesencephalic nuclei. The distribution of nicotine, cytisine, and epibatidine bindings corresponds broadly to the patterns observed in rodents, with the marked exception of the epithalamus. However, in monkey, those distributions match the distribution of alpha2 messenger RNA, rather than that of alpha4 transcripts as it exists in rodent brains. The distribution of the binding sites for alpha-bungarotoxin is larger in the brain of rhesus monkeys than in rodent brain, suggesting a more important role of alpha7 receptors in primates.

Much of our understanding of the physiology of LGN neurons comes from data collected in anaesthetized animals. This study examines the visual responses of LGN neurons in alert animals and compares these responses to those from anaesthetized animals. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, LGN neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with stronger responses and follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies. Stronger responses are likely to translate into an increased coupling between the LGN and visual cortex, as firing rate and interspike interval are known to influence the dynamics of synaptic communication between the two structures. Abstract Despite the increasing use of alert animals for studies aimed at understanding visual processing in the cerebral cortex, relatively little attention has been focused on quantifying the response properties of neurons that provide input to the cortex. Here, we examine the response properties of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in the alert macaque monkey and compare these responses to those in the anaesthetized animal. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre-surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.";"[Alitto, Henry J.; Moore, Bartlett D.; Rathbun, Daniel L.; Usrey, W.

The neurons studied lay within either the alpha or the beta division of lamina 4C; previous workers have shown the alpha division neurons to be contacted by thalamic axon terminals arising from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and the beta division neurons to be contacted by parvocellular LGN inputs. Most thalamic terminals and perhaps the majority of other type 1 (Colonnier, '81), presumed excitatory, inputs to these cells make synaptic contacts on the tips of their dendritic spines. Measurement was made of relative changes in the total number of spines on these alpha and beta spiny neurons over age by measuring both spine density along the dendrites and dendritic arbor size in single 90-mu-m sections from Golgi rapid preparations. Our previous work (Lund et al., '77; Boothe et al., '79) showed a marked proliferation and attrition of spines and dendritic branches to occur in the early postnatal weeks; Rakic et al. ('86) have since proposed that there is a cortexwide synchrony of synapse acquisition and loss during this same period. However, different visual capacities channelled via the magnocellular and parvicellular geniculate relays show different maturational rates (Harwerth et al., '86). This study indicates that the anatomical maturation of spines on the alpha and beta neurons is not temporally coincident from birth to 30 weeks. During this period, phases of spine acquisition and loss on alpha neurons precedes similar phases on beta neurons. The alpha neurons carry a peak spine population at 5-8 weeks postnatal, whereas the beta neurons carry their peak spine populations between 8 and 24 weeks postnatal. At all ages prior to 30 weeks, the two sets of neurons carry quite different total spine populations. Close to 30 weeks of age, the total spine coverage has fallen on both sets of neurons and becomes identical between the alpha and beta neurons. In animals aged 30 weeks to adult, spine coverage per neuron is maintained at a common figure for the alpha and beta neurons despite further growth and disparate dendritic arbor sizes and different local spine densities in the two groups; this suggests that some common sampling paradigm between pre- and postsynaptic elements is adopted by the alpha and beta neurons and also suggests the development of a close functional correlation between the two sets of neurons.";UNIV PITTSBURGH,CTR NEUROSCI,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261;"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";LUND, JS (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PSYCHIAT,336C SCAIFE HALL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY05282, EY01086] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;42;51;51;0;0;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

We examined the activity of 118 neurons in the CM and 62 neurons in the Pf nuclei of the thalamus and 310 tonically active neurons (TANs) in the striatum in awake behaving macaque monkeys and analyzed the effects of pharmacologic inactivation of the CM-Pf on the sensory responsiveness of the striatal TANs. A large proportion of CM and Pf neurons responded to visual (53%) and/or auditory beep (61%) or click (91%) stimuli presented in behavioral tasks, and many responded to unexpected auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli presented outside the task context. The neurons fell into two classes: those having short-latency facilitatory responses (SLF neurons, predominantly in the Pf) and those having long-latency facilitatory responses (LLF neurons, predominantly in the CM). Responses of both types of neuron appeared regardless of whether or not the sensory stimuli were associated with reward. These response characteristics of CM-Pf neurons sharply contrasted with those of TANs in the striatum, which under the same conditions responded preferentially to stimuli associated with reward. Many CM-Pf neurons responded to alerting stimuli such as unexpected handclaps and noises only for the first few times that they occurred; after that, the identical stimuli gradually became ineffective in evoking responses. Habituation of sensory responses was particularly common for the LLF neurons. Inactivation of neuronal activity in the CM and Pf by local infusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, almost completely abolished the pause and rebound facilitatory responses of TANs in the striatum. Such injections also diminished behavioral responses to stimuli associated with reward. We suggest that neurons in the CM and Pf supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events that can activate conditional responses of striatal neurons in combination with dopamine-mediated nigrostriatal inputs having motivational value.";"Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan; Osaka Univ, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";"Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine; Osaka University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)";Kimura, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Physiol, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.;mkimura@basic.kpu-m.ac.jp;"Minamimoto, Takafumi/D-6610-2012; Minamimoto, Takafumi/AAD-8726-2020";"Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Minamimoto, Takafumi/0000-0003-4305-0174; Graybiel, Ann/0000-0002-4326-7720";NINDS NIH HHS [NS-25529] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;85;335;342;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We investigated the time-varying changes of the putaminal spiking activity and the spectral power of local field potentials (LFPs) during a task where the rhythmic tapping of monkeys was guided by isochronous stimuli separated by a fixed duration (synchronization phase), followed by a period of internally timed movements (continuation phase). We found that the power of both bands and the discharge rate of cells showed an orderly change in magnitude as a function of the duration and/or the serial order of the intervals executed rhythmically. More LFPs were tuned to duration and/or serial order in the beta-than the gamma-band, although different values of preferred features were represented by single cells and by both bands. Importantly, in the LFPs tuned to serial order, there was a strong bias toward the continuation phase for the beta-band when aligned to movements, and a bias toward the synchronization phase for the gamma-band when aligned to the stimuli. Our results suggest that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of CBGT, during internally driven rhythmic tapping.;"[Bartolo, Ramon; Prado, Luis; Merchant, Hugo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Queretaro 76230, Mexico";Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico;Merchant, H (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Neurobiol, Campus Juriquilla,Blvd Juriquilla 3001, Queretaro 76230, Mexico.;hugomerchant@unam.mx;"Merchant, Hugo/E-8703-2019; Bartolo, Ramon/AAB-6579-2022";"Merchant, Hugo/0000-0002-3488-9501; Bartolo, Ramon/0000-0003-2165-9747";Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [151223, PAPIIT IN200511, 202421];Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT));"This work was supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia Grants 151223, PAPIIT IN200511 to H.M. and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia scholarship 202421 to R.B.

The principal intraparietal corticocortical connections of area 7m in both cebus and macaque cases were with the ipsilateral medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (MIP) and adjacent superior parietal lobule (area 5), inferior parietal lobule (area 7a), lateral bank of the IFS (area 7ip), caudal parietal operculum (PGop), dorsal bank of the caudal superior temporal sulcus (visual area MST), and medial prestriate cortex (including visual area PO and caudalmedial lobule). Its principal frontal corticocortical connections were with the prefrontal cortex in the shoulder above the principal sulcus and the cortex in the shoulder above the superior ramus of the arcuate sulcus (SAS), the area purported to contain the smooth eye movement-related frontal eye field (FEFsem) in the cebus monkey by other investigators. There were moderate connections with the cortex in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus (purported to contain the saccade-related frontal eye field; FEFsac), supplementary eye field (SEF), and rostral dorsal premotor area (PMDr). Area 7m also had major connections with the cingulate cortex (area 23), particularly the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. The principal subcortical connections of area 7m were with the dorsal portion of the ventrolateral thalamic (VLc) nucleus, lateral posterior thalamic nucleus, lateral pulvinar, caudal mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and medial pulvinar, central lateral, central superior lateral, and central inferior intralaminar thalamic nuclei, dorsolateral caudate nucleus and putamen, middle region of the claustrum, nucleus of the diagonal band, zona incerta, pregeniculate nucleus, anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei, intermediate layer of the superior colliculus, nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsomedial parvicellular red nucleus (macaque cases only), dorsal, dorsolateral and lateral basilar pontine nuclei, nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, locus ceruleus, and superior central nucleus. The findings are discussed in terms of the possibility that area 7m contains a medial parietal eye field and belongs to a neural network of oculomotor-related structures that plays a role in the control of eye movement.

Two developments mandate a re-evaluation of this notion. First, we present a synopsis of our anatomical studies in monkey elucidating principles of organization of cerebral cortex. Efferent fibers emanate from every cortical area, and are directed with topographic precision via association fibers to ipsilateral cortical areas, commissural fibers to contralateral cerebral regions, striatal fibers to basal ganglia, and projection subcortical bundles to thalamus, brainstem and/or pontocerebellar system. We note that cortical areas can be defined by their patterns of subcortical and cortical connections. Second, we consider motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with lesions restricted to basal ganglia, thalamus, or cerebellum, and recognize that these lesions mimic deficits resulting from cortical lesions, with qualitative differences between the manifestations of lesions in functionally related areas of cortical and subcortical nodes. We consider these findings on the basis of anatomical observations from tract tracing studies in monkey, viewing them as disconnection syndromes reflecting loss of the contribution of subcortical nodes to the distributed neural circuits. We introduce a new theoretical framework for the distributed neural circuits, based on general, and specific, principles of anatomical organization, and on the architecture of the nodes that comprise these systems. We propose that neural architecture determines function, i.e., each architectonically distinct cortical and subcortical area contributes a unique transform, or computation, to information processing; anatomically precise and segregated connections between nodes define behavior; and association fiber tracts that link cerebral cortical areas with each other enable the cross-modal integration required for evolved complex behaviors. This model enables the formulation and testing of future hypotheses in investigations using evolving magnetic resonance imaging techniques in humans, and in clinical studies in patients with cortical and subcortical lesions.

Neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which comprise the thalamic input to V1, are not orientation-tuned, but the majority of VI neurons are quite selective. How orientation tuning arises within V1 is still controversial(1,3-17). To study this problem, we measured how the orientation tuning of neurons evolves with time(18-20) using a new method: reverse correlation in the orientation domain. Orientation tuning develops after a delay of 30-45 milliseconds and persists-for 40-85 ms. Neurons in layers 4C alpha or 4C beta, which receive direct input from the thalamus, show a single orientation preference which remains unchanged throughout the response period. In contrast, the preferred orientations of output layer neurons (in layers 2, 3, 4B, 5 or 6) usually change with time, and in many cases the orientation tuning may have more than one peak This difference in dynamics is accompanied by a change in the sharpness of orientation tuning; cells in the input layers are more broadly tuned than cells in the output layers. Many of these observed properties of output layer neurons cannot be explained by simple feedforward models(1,3-6), whereas they arise naturally in feedback networks(7-17). Our results indicate that V1 is more than a bank of static oriented filters; the dynamics of output layer cells appear to be shaped by intracortical feedback.";;;Ringach, DL (corresponding author), NYU,CTR NEURAL SCI,4 WASHINGTON PL,NEW YORK,NY 10003, USA.;;;Shapley, Robert/0000-0003-0099-9849;;;;;30;426;427;0;40;MACMILLAN MAGAZINES LTD;LONDON;PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, ENGLAND N1 9XW;0028-0836;;;NATURE;Nature;MAY 15;1997;387;6630;;;;;281;284;;10.1038/387281a0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/387281a0;;;4;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;WZ167;9153392;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1997WZ16700052;View Full Record in Web of Science

The PPC is distinguished from these areas by receiving thalamic afferents from the lateral dorsal (LD), lateral posterior (LP), and posterior (Po) nuclei, in the absence of input from the ventrobasal complex (VB) or dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nuclei. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that PPC is involved in spatial orientation and directed attention. In the present study we used fluorescent retrograde axonal tracers primarily to investigate the cortical connections of PPC, in order to determine the organization of the circuitry by which PPC is likely to participate in these functions, and also to determine how the topography of its thalamic connections differs from that of neighboring cortical areas. The cortical connections of PPC involve the ventrolateral (VLO) and medial (MO) orbital areas, medial agranular cortex (area Fr2), portions of somatic sensory areas Par1 and Par2, secondary visual areas Oc2M and Oc2L, auditory area Te1, and retrosplenial cortex. The secondary visual areas Oc2L and Oc2M have cortical connections which are similar to those of PPC, but are restricted within orbital cortex to area VLO, and within area Fr2 to its caudal portion, and do not involve auditory area Te1. The cortical connections of hindlimb cortex are largely restricted to somatic sensory and motor areas. Retrosplenial cortex, which is medially adjacent to PPC, has cortical connections that are prominent with visual cortex, do not involve somatic sensory or auditory cortex, and include the presubiculum. We conclude that PPC is distinguished by its pattern of cortical connections with the somatic sensory, auditory and visual areas, and with areas Fr2, and VLO/MO, in addition to its exclusive thalamic connectivity with LD, LP and Po. Because recent behavioral studies indicate that PPC, Fr2 and VLO are involved in directed attention and spatial learning, we suggest that the interconnections among these three cortical areas represent a major component of the circuitry for these functions in rats.;"UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT NEUROSCI, GAINESVILLE, FL 32610 USA; UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT NEUROL SURG, GAINESVILLE, FL 32610 USA; UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT PSYCHOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; NO ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, DE KALB, IL 60115 USA";"State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Northern Illinois University";REEP, RL (corresponding author), UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT PHYSIOL SCI, BOX 100144 HSC, GAINESVILLE, FL 32610 USA.;;;;;;;;43;195;196;0;17;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

Studies of incentive processing have repeatedly demonstrated activation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), thalamus, and anterior insula, three key components of reward neurocircuitry. The contribution of the thalamus to this circuitry in humans has been relatively ignored, a gap that needs to be filled, given the central role of this structure in processing and filtering information. This study aimed to understand how these three regions function as a network during gain or loss anticipation in adults and youth. Towards this goal, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to examine effective connectivity among these three nodes in healthy adults and adolescents who performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Seven connectivity models, based on anatomic connections, were tested. They were estimated for incentive anticipation and underwent Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) to determine the best-fit model for each adult and adolescent group. Connection strengths were extracted from the best-fit model and examined for significance in each group. These variables were then entered into a linear mixed model to test between-group effects on effective connectivity in reward neurocircuitry. The best-fit model for both groups included all possible anatomic connections. Three main findings emerged: (1) Across the task, thalamus and insula significantly influenced NAc; (2) A broader set of significant connections was found for the loss-cue condition than the gain-cue condition in both groups; (3) Finally, between-group comparisons of connectivity strength failed to detect statistical differences, suggesting that adults and adolescents use this incentive-processing network in a similar manner. This study demonstrates the way in which the thalamus and insula influence the NAc during incentive processing in humans. Specifically, this is the first study to demonstrate in humans the key role of thalamus projections onto the NAc in support of reward processing. Our results suggest that anticipation of gain/loss involves an 'alerting' signal (thalamus) that converges with interoceptive information (insula) to shape action selection programs in the ventral striatum.

Eleven aged animals, 21-26-years old, were included in the analysis. Regional CMRglc, normalized to values for the entire brain, were determined for the dorsal prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. The aged animals exhibited significant DR deficits relative to a cohort of normal young monkeys. Variability in DR performance among the aged subjects was significantly correlated with relative hippocampal rCMRglc, and chronological age was a reliable predictor of orbitofrontal rCMRglc ratios. This pattern of results suggests that DR impairments in the aged monkey may partly reflect ape-related dysfunction distributed among multiple limbic system structures that participate in normal learning and memory. Overall, the findings support the use of positron emission tomography in efforts to define the relationship between cognitive performance, age, and brain physiology in nonhuman primates.

We revealed a transient thalamic connectivity increase with the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and a parahippocampal area, which decreased with time. In turn, mPFC-parahippocampal connectivity increased progressively. These findings support a model in which thalamic midline nuclei serve as a hub linking hippocampus, mPFC, and posterior representational areas during memory retrieval at an early (2 h) stage of consolidation, extending classical systems consolidation models by attributing a transient role to midline thalamic nuclei.;"[Thielen, Jan-Willem; Takashima, Atsuko; Tendolkar, Indira; Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6537 Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Thielen, Jan-Willem; Tendolkar, Indira] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Fac Med, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Thielen, Jan-Willem] Erwin L Hahn Inst Magnet Resonance Imaging, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Takashima, Atsuko] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6537 Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Rutters, Femke] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tendolkar, Indira] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, NL-6537 Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6537 Nijmegen, Netherlands";"Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; Radboud University Nijmegen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen";Thielen, JW (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6537 Nijmegen, Netherlands.;jan-willem.thielen@uni-due.de;"Fernandez, Guillen/B-3771-2009; Tendolkar, Indira/F-1167-2010; Tendolkar, I./O-5780-2019; Takashima, Atsuko/E-7880-2012";"Fernandez, Guillen/0000-0002-5522-0604; Takashima, Atsuko/0000-0003-1114-6526";"ICEMED from the Helmholtz Alliance, Germany; European Research Council [ERC R0001075]";"ICEMED from the Helmholtz Alliance, Germany; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC))";J.-W.T. was supported by the ICEMED grant to I.

In the present study, we report that the expression of occ1 mRNA in the macaque neocortex can be classified into two modes. The first mode is associated with excitatory neurons distributed in the major thalamocortical recipient layers that exhibit strong cytochrome oxidase activity. This is highly prominent in V1. The second mode is associated with parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and is distributed across the macaque neocortex, In V1, monocular deprivation showed that occ1 mRNA expression in excitatory neurons was markedly dependent on afferent activity, whereas that in GABAergic interneurons was not. Cross-species comparison showed specific differences in expression. In marmosets, a strong expression was observed in V1 similarly to macaques. The occ1 mRNA expression, however, was generally weak in the mouse neocortex. In rabbit and ferret cortices, the strong expression was observed only in GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that activity-dependent occ1 mRNA expression in the excitatory neurons of V1 was caused by a novel mechanism acquired by primates after their separation from other lineages.;"Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Basic Biol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan";"National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB); Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan";Yamamori, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Brain Biol, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.;yamamori@nibb.ac.jp;Yamamori, Tetsuo/N-6536-2015;"Yamamori, Tetsuo/0000-0001-5016-0078; Tochitani, Shiro/0000-0001-5765-3668";;;;;92;28;29;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Neuroanatomical tracers were injected into electrophysiologically and/or architectonically defined locations, and labeled cell bodies were identified in cortex ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site. Transported tracer was related to architectonically defined boundaries so that the full complement of connections of S2 and PV could be appreciated. Our results indicate that S2 is densely interconnected with the primary somatosensory area (3b), PV, and area 7b of the ipsilateral hemisphere, and with S2, 7b, and 3b in the opposite hemisphere. PV is interconnected with areas 3b and 7b, with the parietal rostroventral area, premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and with the medial auditory belt areas. Contralateral connections were restricted to PV in the opposite hemisphere. These data indicate that S2 and PV have unique and overlapping patterns of connections, and that they comprise part of a network that processes both cutaneous and proprioceptive inputs necessary for tactile discrimination and recognition. Although more data are needed, these patterns of interconnections of cortical fields and thalamic nuclei suggest that the somatosensory system may not be segregated into two separate streams of information processing, as has been hypothesized for the visual system. Rather, some fields may be involved in a variety of functions that require motor and sensory integration.

Pie describe the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle lesions, review lesions described in literature, and discuss possible pharmacologic mechanisms for soman-induced neuron necrosis. Methods: In this retrospective, histopathologic study, records were obtained for 36 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were euthanized 10 days after soman exposure, from a larger group of 103 monkeys that were exposed to soman and used for pharmacologic and lethality studies. Results: Brain lesions were seen in 9 of 15 animals that convulsed and in only 1 of 21 that did not convulse. The brain lesions in our primates were limited to the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (of one animal), and consisted of neuron necrosis and dropout, spongiosis, gliosis, astrocytosis, and vascularization, Heart lesions consisted of myocardial degeneration and necrosis. Three animals had brain and heart lesions, 7 had brain lesions only, and 3 had heart Lesions only. Skeletal muscle lesions, although minimal to mild, were in most of the animals, whether they had convulsed, but most had muscular tremors. These lesions were in the biceps brachii (11 of 22 monkeys), anterior tibialis (8/22), biceps femoris (7/22), flexor carpi radialis (5/22), gastrocnemius (3/22), and diaphragm (1/22). The limited literature on soman lesions in primate brain and heart, and the limited information on skeletal muscle lesions, is reviewed. Conclusions: Brain lesions were not as wide-spread as reported in other studies of primates and rodents, and were significantly associated with convulsions. Unlike other studies using rodents, we observed poor correlation between heart and brain lesions; thus, a single hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis for the brain and heart lesions may be difficult to establish.";USA, Med Res Inst Chem Def, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA;Research Institute of Chemical Defense - China;Britt, JO (corresponding author), USA, Med Res Inst Chem Def, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA.;;;;;;;;30;27;31;0;4;AMER ASSOC LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE;MEMPHIS;9190 CRESTWYN HILLS DR, MEMPHIS, TN 38125 USA;1058-2401;;;COMPARATIVE MED;Comparative Med.;APR;2000;50;2;;;;;133;139;;;;;;7;"Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Veterinary Sciences; Zoology";317CA;10857003;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000087206900006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Differentiation of the pontine sensory syndrome from the thalamic sensory syndrome has generally been made on the basis of distribution of sensory loss and involvement of specific sensory modalities but not without uncertainties and difficulties. Because the pontine tegmentum plays a pivotal role in generating horizontal eye movement, we attempted to discriminate these 2 syndromes by analyzing horizontal eye movements in stroke patients with pure hemisensory syndrome. Methods-Horizontal saccade, pursuit, vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR), and VOR cancellation (VORC) were evaluated using electro-oculography in 6 patients with hemisensory syndromes, 3 due to pontine stroke and 3 due to thalamic stroke, and all were verified by MRI or CT. In addition, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded. Results-Smooth pursuit and VORC directed toward the side of the lesion were impaired unilaterally in patients with pontine sensory stroke, whereas those 2 movements were intact bilaterally in patients with thalamic sensory stroke. Saccade and VOR were preserved in all patients. SEPs were normal in all patients with pontine and thalamic sensory strokes. No difference was found in the pattern of sensory disturbance between the 2 types of stroke patients.

Interpretations of available data have led to opposing 'information funneling' and 'parallel processing' hypotheses. Using motor circuit as a model, we examined whether cortico-subcortical circuits, especially cortico-basal ganglia circuits, are funneled or parallel in the control of volitional movement. Twenty-five healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activated clusters during self-initiated, sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements of the left hand were identified in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), right lateral premotor cortex (PM) and primary motor cortex (M1), and in the right striatum and thalamus. These functionally defined clusters were applied to probabilistic tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI to examine patterns of connectivity. Striatal and thalamic sub-regions with high probabilities of connection to the motor cortices partially overlapped, with connection to the two premotor areas outspreading rostrally relative to M1. We suggest that, on a macroscopic anatomical level, there is overlap as well as segregation among connections of the motor cortices with the striatum and thalamus. This supports the notion that neuronal information of the motor cortices is funneled, and parallel processing is not an exclusive principle in the basal ganglia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on a wiring diagram that spans the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus of the macaque brain, we identify robust modules in the network that provide a mesoscopic-level description of its topological architecture. Surprisingly, we find that the modular architecture facilitates rapid communication across the network, instead of localizing activity as is typically expected in networks having community organization. By considering processes of diffusive spreading and coordination, we demonstrate that the specific pattern of inter-and intramodular connectivity in the network allows propagation to be even faster than equivalent randomized networks with or without modular structure. This pattern of connectivity is seen at different scales and is conserved across principal cortical divisions, as well as subcortical structures. Furthermore, we find that the physical proximity between areas is insufficient to explain the modular organization, as similar mesoscopic structures can be obtained even after factoring out the effect of distance constraints on the connectivity. By supplementing the topological information about the macaque connectome with physical locations, volumes, and functions of the constituent areas and analyzing this augmented dataset, we reveal a counterintuitive role played by the modular architecture of the brain in promoting global coordination of its activity. It suggests a possible explanation for the ubiquity of modularity in brain networks.;"[Pathak, Anand; Menon, Shakti N.; Sinha, Sitabhra] CIT Campus, Inst Math Sci, Chennai 600113, India; [Pathak, Anand; Sinha, Sitabhra] Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Mumbai 400094, India";"Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) India; Homi Bhabha National Institute";"Pathak, A (corresponding author), CIT Campus, Inst Math Sci, Chennai 600113, India.;Pathak, A (corresponding author), Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Mumbai 400094, India.";;Menon, Shakti/HOH-8797-2023;;"Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India; DST";"Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)); DST(Department of Science & Technology (India))";S.N.M. has been supported by the IMSc Complex Systems Project (12th Plan) , and the Center of Excellence in Complex Systems and Data Science, both funded by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.

However, little is known about how prenatal perturbation translates into adult brain dysfunction. Here, we use a longitudinal study design to examine the effects of disruption of early gestational neurogenesis on brain volume in the non-human primate. Methods and Principal Findings: Five Rhesus macaques were exposed to x-irradiation in early gestation (E30-E41), and four control monkeys were sham-irradiated at comparable ages. Whole brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 and 5 years of age. Volumes of whole cerebrum, cortical gray matter, caudate, putamen, and thalamus were estimated using semi-automated segmentation methods and high dimensional brain mapping. Volume reductions spanning all ages were observed in irradiated monkeys in the putamen (15-24%, p = 0.01) and in cortical gray matter (6-15%, p = 0.01). Upon covarying for whole cerebral volume, group differences were reduced to trend levels (putamen: p = 0.07; cortical gray matter: p = 0.08). No group-by-age effects were significant. Conclusions: Due to the small number of observations, the conclusions drawn from this study must be viewed as tentative. Early gestational irradiation may result in non-uniform reduction of gray matter, mainly affecting the putamen and cerebral cortex. This may be relevant to understanding how early prenatal environmental insult could lead to brain morphological differences in neurodevelopmental diseases.";"[Aldridge, Kristina; Moffitt, Amanda J.; Cole, Kimberly K.] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Anat Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Wang, Lei; Csernansky, John G.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Wang, Lei; Csernansky, John G.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Harms, Michael P.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Selemon, Lynn D.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, New Haven, CT USA";"University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Washington University (WUSTL); Yale University";Aldridge, K (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Pathol & Anat Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.;aldridgek@missouri.edu;"wang, le/HKN-3406-2023; Wang, Lei/I-7552-2013";"Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3870-3388; Aldridge, Kristina/0000-0003-3924-761X; Harms, Michael/0000-0001-7945-036X";National Institutes of Health [P50-MH071616, RO1-MH59329, P50-MH44866, T32MH17104];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);National Institutes of Health grant numbers P50-MH071616, RO1-MH59329, P50-MH44866, T32MH17104.

They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure-ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.;"[Self, Matthew W.; Kooijmans, Roxana N.; Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Netherlands Inst Neurosci KNAW, Dept Vis & Cognit, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Super, Hans] Univ Barcelona, Fac Psicol, ICREA, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Super, Hans] Univ Barcelona, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Basica, Barcelona 08035, Spain; [Lamme, Victor A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Roelfsema, Pieter R.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurogen & Cognit Res, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands";"Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN-KNAW); ICREA; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam";Self, MW (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Neurosci KNAW, Dept Vis & Cognit, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands.;m.self@nin.knaw.nl;Roelfsema, Pieter/J-6903-2013;"Roelfsema, Pieter/0000-0002-1625-0034; Super, Hans/0000-0001-9328-0096; Self, Matthew/0000-0001-5731-579X";"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)-VICI grant; European Union (EU): Information Society Technologies (IST) Cognitive Systems [027198]; Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP); NWO-VIDI grant; European Research Council; ICREA Funding Source: Custom";"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)-VICI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Union (EU): Information Society Technologies (IST) Cognitive Systems(European Union (EU)); Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)(Human Frontier Science Program); NWO-VIDI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ICREA(ICREA)";We thank Kor Brandsma for help with surgical procedures and animal training and Istvan Ulbert for technical help with the injectrodes.

We now describe the presence and distribution of the PTH2R and TIP39 in the brain of primates using a range of tissues and ages from macaque and human brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry of TIP39 mRNA, studied in young macaque brain, due to its possible decline beyond late postnatal ages, was present only in the thalamic subparafascicular area and the pontine medial paralemniscal nucleus. In contrast, in situ hybridization histochemistry in macaque identified high levels of PTH2R expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, medial geniculate, and the Pontine tegmentum. PTH2R mRNA was also detected in several human brain areas by RT-PCR. The distribution of PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in human, determined by immunocytochemistry, was similar to that in rodents, including dense fiber networks in the medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular, periventricular and infundibular (arcuate) nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, median eminence, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nuclei, medullary dorsal reticular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Co-localization suggested that PTH2R fibers are glutamatergic, and that TIP39 may directly influence hypophysiotropic somatostatin containing and indirectly influence corticotropin releasing-hormone containing neurons. The results demonstrate that TIP39 and the PTH2R are expressed in the brain of primates in locations that suggest involvement in regulation of fear, anxiety, reproductive behaviors, release of pituitary hormones, and nociception.

In this review, we summarize recent findings where molecular biological techniques have revealed a small number of area-specific genes in the nonhuman primate cortex. One of these (occl) is strongly expressed in primary visual cortex and is associated with thalamocortical connections. Another gene, RBP, is more strongly expressed in association areas. It is not clear whether RBP might be linked with any particular connectional system, but several possibilities are raised. We also discuss possible roles of area-specific genes in postnatal development, and conclude with a brief sketch of future directions.

Different types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons provide output to different thalamic nuclei, and it is therefore of interest to understand the sources of functional input to these neurons. We studied the morphologies and local excitatory input to individual layer 6 neurons in rat visual cortex by combining intracellular labeling and recording with laser-scanning photostimulation. As in previous photostimulation studies, we found significant differences in the sources of local excitatory input to different cell types. Most notably, there were differences in local input to neurons that, based on analogy to barrel cortex, are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus. The more striking finding, however, was the paucity of superficial layer input to layer 6 neurons in the rat visual cortex, contrasting sharply with layer 6 neurons in the primate visual cortex. These observations provide insight into differences in function between cortical projections to first-order versus higher-order thalamic nuclei and also show that these circuits can be organized differently in different species.;"Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Neurosci Program, San Diego, CA 92103 USA";"Salk Institute; University of California System; University of California San Diego";Callaway, EM (corresponding author), Salk Inst Biol Studies, Syst Neurobiol Lab, 10010 N Torrey Pines Rd, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;callaway@salk.edu;"Zarrinpar, Amir/L-4077-2019; Callaway, Edward M/D-4336-2011; , Amir/AAJ-6732-2020";"Zarrinpar, Amir/0000-0001-6423-5982; Callaway, Edward M/0000-0002-6366-5267; ";"NEI NIH HHS [EY-10745] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHS [GM07198] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH063912, MH-63912] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";;;29;69;69;0;2;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Previous studies from our laboratories have reported the successful development of agonist, F-18-nifene. In attempts to develop potential antagonists, F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine were previously reported. Further optimization of these fluoropropyl derivatives has now been carried out resulting in 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifrolene) as a new high affinity agent for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifrolene in rat brain homogenate assays - labeled with H-3-cytisine - exhibited a binding affinity of 0.36 nM. The fluorine-18 analog. F-18-nifrolene, was synthesized in approximately 10%-20% yield and specific activity was estimated to be >2000 Ci/mmol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding to anterior thalamic nuclei, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with AN receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >90% by 300 mu M nicotine. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio (>10) was the highest for F-18-nifrolene with several other regions showing selective binding. In vivo rat PET studies exhibited rapid uptake of F-18-nifrolene in the brain with specific retention in the thalamus and other brain regions while clearing out from the cerebellum. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio value in the rat was >4. Administration of nicotine caused a rapid decline in the thalamic 18F-nifrolene suggesting reversible binding to nicotinic receptors. PET imaging studies of F-18-nifrolene in anesthetized rhesus monkey revealed highest binding in the thalamus followed by regions of the lateral cingulated and temporal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least binding. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio in the monkey brain was >3 at 120 min. These ratios of F-18-nifrolene are higher than measured for F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine. F-18-Nifrolene thus shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR.

A fundamental question is thus how the brain integrates the separate elements of an object defined by several sensory components to form a unified percept. The superior colliculus was the main model for studying multisensory integration. At the cortical level, until recently, multisensory integration appeared to be a characteristic attributed to high-level association regions. First, we describe recently observed direct cortico-cortical connections between different sensory cortical areas in the non-human primate and discuss the potential role of these connections. Then, we show that the projections between different sensory and motor cortical areas and the thalamus enabled us to highlight the existence of thalamic nuclei that, by their connections, may represent an alternative pathway for information transfer between different sensory and/or motor cortical areas. The thalamus is in position to allow a faster transfer and even an integration of information across modalities. Finally, we discuss the role of these non-specific connections regarding behavioral evidence in the monkey and recent electrophysiological evidence in the primary cortical sensory areas.

The genesis and function of alpha has been the subject of intense investigation for the past 80 years. Whereas early work focused on the thalamus as the pacemaker of alpha rhythm, subsequent slice studies revealed that pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of sensory cortices are capable of oscillating in the alpha frequency range independently. How thalamic and cortical generating mechanisms in the intact brain might interact to shape the organization and function of alpha oscillations remains unclear. We addressed this problem by analyzing laminar profiles of local field potential and multiunit activity (MUA) recorded with linear array multielectrodes from the striate cortex of two macaque monkeys performing an intermodal selective attention task. Current source density (CSD) analysis was combined with CSD-MUA coherence to identify intracortical alpha current generators and assess their potential for pacemaking. Coherence and Granger causality analysis was applied to delineate the patterns of interaction among different alpha current generators. We found that (1) separable alpha current generators are located in superficial, granular, and deep layers, with both layer 4C and deep layers containing primary local pacemaking generators, suggesting the involvement of the thalamocortical network, and (2) visual attention reduces the magnitude of alpha oscillations as well as the level of alpha interactions, consistent with numerous reports of occipital alpha reduction with visual attention in human EEG. There is also indication that alpha oscillations in the lateral geniculate cohere with those in V1.;"[Bollimunta, Anil; Mo, Jue; Ding, Mingzhou] Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Schroeder, Charles E.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10027 USA";"State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Columbia University";Ding, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;mding@bme.ufl.edu;Mo, Jue/B-3742-2014;;NIMH NIH HHS [MH87275, R01 MH079388-01A1, R01 MH060358-09A1, MH79388, R21 MH087275-01A1, R01 MH060358, R01 MH079388, R21 MH087275, MH60358] Funding Source: Medline;NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));;;57;277;281;0;39;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

We recognize three subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are architectonically distinct from the neighboring somatosensory and visual cortices. Furthermore, we show that the different parietal areas are differently connected with thalamic nuclei. The medial portion of PPC (mPPC) is connected primarily with the medial portion of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), whereas the lateral portion (lPPC) connects with the posterior complex (Po). The more caudolateral part of PPC (PtP) also projects to Po but can be distinguished from lPPC based on architectonic criteria. The primary somatic and visual cortices, neighboring PPC, are preferentially connected with the primary ventral posterior and dorsolateral geniculate nuclei, respectively, and less with the associational Po and LP. Particularly the border between the secondary visual cortex and the PPC has been a matter of controversy, but here we show that, although PPC subareas are connected with Po and medial LP, the medial and lateral secondary visual cortices are connected with lateral LP and a portion of medial LP different from that connected with PPC. The resulting delineations and specifications of connectivity with thalamic nuclei together with upcoming studies of cortical connectivity will facilitate detailed studies on the role of the subdivisions of PPC in the rat as diverse, higher order associative cortical areas, comparable to those described in the primate.for J.

After tracer injections in the mediodorsal nuclei on either side, neurons were retrogradely labeled in all the areas of the contralateral prefrontal cortex in which ipsilateral labeling was also observed. Contralateral corticothalamic cells accounted for 15% of the labeled neurons in the orbital and agranular insular areas, while their proportion was lower (3%) in the anterior cingulate cortex. Up to 70% of the contralateral cortical neurons were double labeled by bilateral injections in the mediodorsal nuclei. At the electron microscopic level, unilateral injections of biotinylated dextran-amine in the orbitofrontal cortex resulted in anterograde labeling of small terminals and a few large boutons in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus, while only small boutons were identified contralaterally. The diameter of postsynaptic dendritic profiles contacted by labeled small cortical endings was significantly larger in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus than contralaterally. These findings demonstrate that dense contralateral cortical projections to the mediodorsal nucleus derive from the orbital and agranular insular areas, and that crossed corticothalamic afferents are mostly formed by collaterals of the ipsilateral connections. Our observations also point out the heterogeneity of corticothalamic boutons in the rat mediodorsal nucleus and morphological differences in the synaptic organization of prefrontal fibers innervating the two sides, indicating that ipsilateral cortical afferents may be more proximally distributed than crossed cortical fibers on dendrites of mediodorsal neurons.

In this study, to explore potential anatomical bases for these neuronal activities, we injected retrograde tracers (CTB-Alexa-488 and CTB-gold) into the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus and examined the distribution of labeled cell bodies in macaque monkey brains. The Nissl staining showed that the cortex in the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus has consistent layer 4 which means that the cortical region is a part of the granular prefrontal cortex. The injection site belonged to the sulcal portion of area 9m in two cases and the sulcal portion of area 8Bm in one case. In addition to the continuous distribution of labeled cells in the two areas (areas 9m and 8Bm) around the injection site, the labeled cells were densely distributed in the cingulate areas (areas 24, 32, and 23) in all the cases. The dense labeling of cells was also found in other prefrontal areas (areas 46, 10, 11, and 12) in the two cases with injection into the sulcal portion of area 9m, whereas the dense labeling of cells was found in pre-motor areas (F6 and F7) in the case with injection into the sulcal portion of area 8Bm. The dense labeling of cells in the prefrontal and premotor areas was more similar to those previously found after injections into dorsal parts of areas 9 and 8B.

Its therapeutic effect may depend on its ability to enter the brain and bind to the oxytocin receptor. To date, the brain tissue penetrance of intranasal oxytocin has not been demonstrated. In this nonhuman primate study, we administer deuterated oxytocin intranasally and intravenously to rhesus macaques and measure, with mass spectrometry, concentrations of labeled (exogenously administered) and endogenous oxytocin in 12 brain regions two hours after oxytocin administration. Labeled oxytocin is quantified after intranasal (not intravenous) administration in brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, brainstem, and thalamus) that lie in the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. These results suggest that intranasal administration bypasses the blood-brain barrier, delivering oxytocin to specific brain regions, such as the striatum, where oxytocin acts to impact motivated behaviors. Further, high concentrations of endogenous oxytocin are in regions that overlap with projection fields of oxytocinergic neurons. The location and extent of intranasal oxytocin brain penetrance has not been shown. Here the authors show that oxytocin, administered intranasally, enters brain regions along the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and there, reaches biologically relevant concentrations.;"[Lee, M.

SIV infected model for detecting the neurological changes with progression was studied. Methods: In the study, six rhesus macaques infected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were scanned by resting-state fMRI at the following time points: before SIV inoculation (baseline), 12 weeks and 24 weeks post inoculation (12 wpi, 24 wpi). Meanwhile, the immunological parameters including serum percentage of CD4+ T cell, CD4/CD8 ratio and absolute CD4+ T cell number were measured and analyzed. Results: In comparison of baseline, significant decreased ReHo was found in the left superior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, right precuneus, left angular gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus; in contrast increased ReHo in putamen at 12 wpi. Moreover, at the time of 24 wpi, decreased ReHo was observed in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulated gyrus and thalamus, while ReHo was increased in the left putamen, hippocampus, left anterior cingulated cortex and precentral cortex. The correlation analysis revealed that ReHo in the superior frontal gyrus showed negative association with CD4/CD8 ratio and positive with absolute CD4+ T cell number. The correlation analysis showed that percentage of CD4+ was correlated with the ReHo values in right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral thalamus and amygdala positively; negative relationship with left putamen, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior and middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The study first indicates that hippocampus, putamen, frontal and occipital lobe were impaired by using rs-fMRI and correlated with immunological parameters. Thus, ReHo value can be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of spontaneous brain activity changes caused by the progression of neurological impairments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In a sample of 4654 excitatory neurons, synapse cover did not correlate consistently with cell variety (pyramid or spiny stellate), soma size, synaptic apposition length or thalamic input. There were significant differences in somatic synapse cover per layer, but the pattern of differences in cover among layers differed significantly between animals, suggesting that laminar environment alone is not a generally applicable determinant of amount of inhibitory synapse cover. The pattern of cover for cells in different layers was, however, similar between the two hemispheres of an individual monkey. Measures of inhibitory synapse cover on four sets of pyramidal neurons in layers 5 and 6, each with different efferent projection targets, showed that the sets differed significantly from other cells in their respective layers, and differed significantly from each other. These findings demonstrate that there is unique circuitry for different subsystems within single layers of cortex and provide a rationale for the rich variety of cortical GABAergic interneurons within single layers.;"Univ Utah, Dept Ophthalmol, John A Moran Eye Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; Inst Ophthalmol, Dept Visual Sci, London EC1V 9EL, England; CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA";"Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of London; University College London; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY)";Lund, JS (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Ophthalmol, John A Moran Eye Ctr, 50 Univ Hlth Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.;;;;;;;;31;11;11;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

After injections of Fluoro-Gold into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in sections also processed for calbindin-D 28-kD and neurotensin immunoreactivities to facilitate identification of subterritories in the ventral pallidum. Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells were counted in series of sections cut through the ventral pallidum, rostral globus pallidus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, and the sublenticular gray region, including parts of the extended amygdala. Data were expressed as cells/unit area and as percentages of all labeled forebrain cells. Mediodorsal nucleus-projecting rostroventral forebrain neurons were most numerous in the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum and pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle. Few were observed in the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. In addition, following injections into the ventral pallidum, anterogradely transported biotinylated dextran amine was evaluated in sections processed for calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Injection into the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum resulted in robust anterograde labeling of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area and weak labeling of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Conversely, after injection into the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, anterograde labeling was weak in the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area, but robust in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. The results are consistent with a predominant accumbens shell influence on the mediodorsal nucleus and with cortico-ventral striatopallidal-thalamocortical pathways that begin and end in different parts of the frontal lobe.

Much is known about the adaptive effects of constant stimulation over prolonged periods. However, there are open questions regarding adaptation to stimuli that are changing over time, interrupted, or repeated. Feature-specific adaptation to repeating stimuli has been shown to occur as early as primary visual cortex (V1), but there is also evidence for more generalized, fatigue-like adaptation that might occur at an earlier stage of processing. Here, we show adaptation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake, fixating monkeys following brief (1 s) exposure to repeated cycles of a 4-Hz drifting grating. We examined the relative change of each neuron's response across successive (repeated) grating cycles. We found that neurons from all cell classes (parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular) showed significant adaptation. However, only magnocellular neurons showed adaptation when responses were averaged to a population response. In contrast to firing rates, response variability was largely unaffected. Finally, adaptation was comparable between monocular and binocular stimulation, suggesting that rapid LGN adaptation is monocular in nature. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural adaptation can be defined as reduction of spiking responses following repeated or prolonged stimulation. Adaptation helps adjust neural responsiveness to avoid saturation and has been suggested to improve perceptual selectivity, information transmission, and predictive coding. Here, we report rapid adaptation to repeated cycles of gratings drifting over the receptive field of neurons at the earliest site of postretinal processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.;"[Daumail, Loic; Carlson, Brock M.; Mitchell, Blake A.; Westerberg, Jacob A.; Tong, Frank; Maier, Alexander] Vanderbilt Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cox, Michele A.] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY USA; [Westerberg, Jacob A.] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Dept Vis & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Johnson, Cortez] Kaiser Permanente Bernard J Tyson Sch Med Pasadena, Pasadena, CA USA; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Save Sight Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Martin, Paul R.] Univ Sydney, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Integrat Bra, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dougherty, Kacie] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ USA";"Vanderbilt University; University of Rochester; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN-KNAW); University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Princeton University";Maier, A (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;alex.maier@vanderbilt.edu;"Martin, Paul R/A-4346-2009; Maier, Alexander/B-7489-2009; Westerberg, Jacob/Q-5989-2016";"Martin, Paul R/0000-0002-5166-9658; Mitchell, Blake/0000-0001-7321-2854; Maier, Alexander/0000-0002-7250-502X; Dougherty, Kacie/0000-0001-6295-0026; Daumail, Loic/0000-0002-1887-2574; Westerberg, Jacob/0000-0001-5331-8707; Carlson, Brock/0000-0003-4846-099X";"National Eye Institute (NEI) [1R01EY027402-03, R01EY029278]; Vision Research Center core Grant from the NEI; Whitehall Foundation; Knights Templar Eye Foundation; National Eye Institute [T32EY007135]; Vision Research Center training Grant;  [F31EY031293];  [P30EY008126]";"National Eye Institute (NEI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Vision Research Center core Grant from the NEI; Whitehall Foundation; Knights Templar Eye Foundation; National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Vision Research Center training Grant; ; ";This work is supported by the National Eye Institute (NEI) research project Grants 1R01EY027402-03 and R01EY029278, a Vision Research Center core Grant P30EY008126 from the NEI, a Vision Research Center training Grant T32EY007135, a research grant from the Whitehall Foundation, a career starter grant from the Knights Templar Eye Foundation.

Tissue blocks from the frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and substantia nigra were dissected and total RNA was extracted. Dopamine D2 and D5 receptor DNA fragments were generated from rhesus monkey genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction. To generate dopamine receptor subtype-specific cRNA probes, DNA fragments corresponding to the carboxy terminus of the rhesus monkey D1 and D2 receptor genes and to the putative transmembrane domain regions (IV-VI) of the D5 receptor gene, were subcloned into the pGEM3Z/4Z vectors. Expression of D1 receptor mRNA exhibited significant regional differences: striatum > > > cerebral cortex 2 hippocampus 2 lateral thalamus. D1 receptor mRNA was found in low quantities in the medial thalamus, but was not consistently expressed in the substantia nigra area. In contrast, D2 receptor mRNA was detected in all regions that were studied: striatum > > > substantia nigra > > hippocampus 2 cerebral cortex greater than or equal to medial thalamus greater than or equal to lateral thalamus. D5 receptor mRNA was also expressed in all regions, with highest levels in the cerebral cortex, striatum and lateral thalamus, and moderate levels in the substantia nigra, medial thalamus and the hippocampus. The D5 receptor mRNA appears to be widely distributed in the monkey brain.

Neuropathological examination revealed glial fibrillary tangles (GPTs) mainly distributed in the putamen, caudate nucleus. thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, red nucleus. globus pallidus, trapezoid body, pyramid, pens and medulla oblongata of the brain, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the thalamic nuclei. These structures were positively stained by the modified Gallyas-Braak (GB) method and immunostained for tau. The tau-positive argyrophilic GFTs were morphologically classified into four types, as in human cases. i.e.. tufts of abnormal fibers (TAFs), thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSAs). glial coiled bodies (GCBs) and argyrophilic threads (ATs) depending on their GB profiles, and GCBs were the major structures in this case. Some of these structures were also immunoreactive for alpha-synuclein. The glial cells possessing the structures were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein. a marker for astrocytes, indicating that the argyrophilic GFTs were present in oligodendroglia. In addition, marked neuronal loss and ubiquitin-positive spheroid bodies were observed in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus. According to the characteristic distribution of the argyrophilic structures in neurons and glial cells as well as clinical signs, the monkey might have suffered from a neurodegenerative disease such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

Four areas were identified in the macaque monkey: the primary and supplementary orofacial motor areas (MIoro and SMAoro) and the principal and deep parts of the cortical masticatory area (CMaAp and CMaAd), where intracortical microstimulation produced single twitch-like or rhythmic jaw movements, respectively. Tracer injections into these areas labeled terminals in the ipsilateral putamen in a topographic fashion (MIoro vs. SMAoro and CMaAp vs. CMaAd), in the lateral reticular formation and trigeminal sensory nuclei contralaterally (MIoro and CMaAp) or bilaterally (SMAoro) in a complex manner of segregation vs. overlap, and in the medial parabranchial and Kolliker-Fuse nuclei contralaterally (CMaAd). The MIoro and CMaAp received thalamic projections from the ventrolateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei, the SMAoro from the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei, and the CMaAd from the ventroposteromedial nucleus. The MIoro, SMAoro, CMaAp, and CMaAd received intracortical projections from the ventral premotor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and rostral cingulate motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and area 7b, and various sensory areas. In addition, the MIoro and CMaAp received projections from the three other jaw movement-related areas. Our results suggest that the four jaw movement-related cortical areas may play important roles in the formation of distinctive masticatory patterns.;"Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo 1838526, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Showa Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Physiol, Tokyo 1428555, Japan";"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Showa University";Takada, M (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo 1838526, Japan.;takada@tmin.ac.jp;;Nambu, Atsushi/0000-0003-2153-5445;;;;;145;51;56;0;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Ten healthy human volunteers underwent brain scan examinations by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two optic flow experiments. In addition to the classical LGN-V1-hMT + pathway, our results showed a significant direct influence of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded in LGN over that in hMT +, not mediated by V1 activity, which strongly supports the existence of a bilateral pathway that connects LGN directly to hMT + and serves visual motion processing. Furthermore, we evaluated the relative latencies among areas functionally connected in the processing of visual motion. Using LGN as a reference region, hMT + exhibited a statistically significant earlier peak of activation as compared to V1. In conclusion, our findings suggest the co-existence of an alternative route that directly links LGN to hMT +, bypassing V1. This direct pathway may play a significant functional role for the faster detection of motion and may contribute to explain persistence of unconscious motion detection in individuals with severe destruction of primary visual cortex (blindsight).

We have developed pain models for cynomolgus macaques because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the cynomolgus macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaques are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. The purpose of this study is to elucidate pain-related brain activation regions in the macaque models using fMRI. Generally, pain testing in animal models has been based on avoidance behavior against pain stimuli. However, we identified pain-related brain activation regions using fMRI under propofol anesthesia as a more objective evaluation method. In the macaque model of chymopapain-induced discogenic low back pain, the activity of the insular cortex occurred in response to lumbar compression stimulation. In the macaque model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, activation of the insular cortex also occurred in response to cold stimuli. As a result of evaluating pregabalin, duloxetine and tramadol, only duloxetine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the macaque model of postoperative pain, activation of the insula cortex was mainly activated by pressure stimulation. As a result of evaluating morphine, pregabalin and diclofenac, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to postoperative pain. However, macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis exhibited a pain response against pressure stimuli to the abdomen, and had activation of the thalamus. As a result of evaluating morphine, meloxicam and acetaminophen, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of thalamus due to abdominal pain from endometriosis. It was suggested that the brain activation regions could change due to various conditions that can cause the pain, as the acute pain increased activation in the insula cortex and the chronic pain increased activation in the thalamus. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fMRI as a pain biomarker, and fMRI analysis using the macaques might provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. Therefore, these study will contribute to the development of new analgesics for each pain as well as to the progress in the areas of brain research.;"[Ushirozako, Hiroki; Yoshida, Go; Hasegawa, Tomohiko; Yamato, Yu; Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, 1-20-1 Handayama, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4313192, Japan; [Yamato, Yu] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Div Geriatr Musculoskeletal Hlth, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Natsume, Takahiro; Ogawa, Shinya; Awaga, Yuji; Hama, Aldric; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki] Hamamatsu Pharma Res Inc, Pharmacol Grp, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan";"Hamamatsu University School of Medicine; Hamamatsu University School of Medicine";Ushirozako, H (corresponding author), Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, 1-20-1 Handayama, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 4313192, Japan.;;Ushirozako, Hiroki/AAH-5949-2019;;;;;;15;0;0;0;3;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN;TOKYO;JAPANESE ASSOC STUDY PAIN, TOKYO, 00000, JAPAN;0915-8588;2187-4697;;PAIN RES;Pain Res.;;2020;35;1;;;;;45;51;;10.11154/pain.35.45;http://dx.doi.org/10.11154/pain.35.45;;;7;Clinical Neurology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Neurosciences & Neurology;NG1AR;;gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000563720600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although its anatomy is well known, in particular thanks to studies in non-human primates, its role in perception and cognition remains poorly understood. Here, we used resting-state functional connectivity from a large sample of high-resolution data provided by the Human Connectome Project, combined with a large-scale meta-analysis approach to segregate and characterize the functional organization of the pulvinar nucleus. We identified five clusters per pulvinar with distinct connectivity profiles and determined their respective coactivation patterns. Using the Neurosynth database, we then investigated the functional significance of these co-activation networks. Our results confirm the functional heterogeneity of the pulvinar, revealing clearcut differences across clusters in terms of their connectivity patterns and associated cognitive domains. While the anterior and lateral clusters appear to be involved in action and attention domains, the ventromedial and dorsomedial clusters may preferentially subserve emotional processes and saliency detection. In contrast, the inferior cluster shows less specificity but correlates with perception and memory processes. Collectively, our results suggest that the pulvinar underwrites different components of cognition, supporting a central role in the coordination of cortico-subcortical processes mediated by distributed brain networks.;"[Guedj, Carole; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med, Neurosci Dept, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Sch Geneva, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland";;Guedj, C (corresponding author), Univ Med, Neurosci Dept, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Sch Geneva, Campus BIOTECH H8,9 Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.;carole.guedj@unige.ch;Vuilleumier, Patrik/AAJ-1839-2021;"Vuilleumier, Patrik/0000-0002-8198-9214; Guedj, Carole/0000-0001-9477-8873";"Swiss National Science Foundation [320030_166704]; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University;  [1U54MH091657]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [320030_166704] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)";"Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; ; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";"This work was supported by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to PV [grant number 320030_166704].

Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative image analysis was used to measure mRNAs coding for CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and thalamic center median-subfascicular complex (CM-Sf). Then, CRH neurons in the PVN were immunostained and the area of immunostaining was measured. Also, CRH fibers were immunostained in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the area of immunostaining was obtained. Finally, POMC mRNA expression was characterized in the hypothalamic infundibular nucleus. The groups were compared with ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keul's (SNK) post hoc comparison. Results: CRH mRNA was significantly elevated in the caudal PVN in the MSR and SS animals compared to HSR animals (p < 0.05, SNK). There was a significant increase in average and total CRH-positive area in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). There was also a significant increase in CRH volume in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the CM-Sf, the average CRH optical density was significantly higher in the MSR and SS groups than in the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the central nucleus of the amygdala, the area of CRH fiber staining was significantly higher in the SS group than in the MSR or HSR groups (p < 0.05, SNK). There was no difference between the groups in POMC mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Conclusion: Macaques that exhibit immediate suppression of reproductive function upon stress are considered stress sensitive. These animals have elevated CRH in the hypothalamus and limbic structures, which may play a role in suppressing the hypothalamic-gonadal axis upon stress initiation. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

The analyses herein tested whether abnormalities of volumes of brain structures forming nodes of these separate feed-forward and feedback systems are selectively related to each other and whether any of these noncortical regions can account for cognitive and motor deficits occurring as sequelae of chronic alcoholism. Methods: Regional brain measures originated from our prior neuroimaging studies, showing in alcoholics significant volume deficits in the principal structures of interest: cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, pons, and thalamus as well as prefrontal, frontal, and parietal cortex. Neuropsychological functions targeted for analysis-problem solving, visuospatial ability, and static postural stability-showed 0.6 to 1.6 SD deficits in these alcoholic men. Results: In alcoholics, the patterns of correlations were consistent with dissociation of thalamic and pontine circuitry. Pontine and thalamic volumes were not correlated with each other. Pontine volumes correlated with white matter volumes of anterior superior vermis and gray and white matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres but not with cortical regional volumes. Thalamic volumes correlated with gray matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres, parietal cortex, and inferior posterior vermian lobule, which itself correlated with parietal, prefrontal, and frontal cortical volumes. Controls did not show these correlational patterns. Brain structure-function relationships in alcoholics examined with multiple regression identified anterior vermian but not prefrontal or parietal volume as a unique predictor of balance scores; vermian and thalamic but not prefrontal cortical volumes as predictors of card sorting scores; and cerebellar hemispheric white matter but not parietal cortical volume as a predictor of visuospatial ability. Conclusions: Each major node of frontocerebellar circuitry shows volume deficits in alcoholics but can be independently compromised.

Anterograde tracers placed into the olfactory bulb labeled axons in eight primary olfactory cortical areas: the anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex, ventral tenia tecta, olfactory tubercle, anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala, periamygdaloid cortex, and olfactory division of the entorhinal cortex. The bulbar axons terminate in the outer part of layer I throughout these areas and are most dense in areas that are close to the lateral olfactory tract. Labeled axons also were found in the superficial part of nucleus of the horizontal diagonal band. Retrograde tracers injected into the olfactory bulb labeled cells in the nucleus of the diagonal band and in all of the primary olfactory cortical areas except the olfactory tubercle. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb evoked short-latency unit responses and a characteristic field wave in the primary olfactory cortex. Multiunit activity in layer II tended to be of shorter latency than that in layer III and the endopiriform nucleus. Associational connections within the primary olfactory cortex were demonstrated with anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and the entorhinal cortex. Injections into the piriform cortex near the lateral olfactory tract labeled axons in the deep part of layer I of many primary olfactory areas, but especially in areas near the tract. An injection into the rostral entorhinal cortex, distant to the lateral olfactory tract, labeled a complementary distribution of axons in deep layer I of olfactory areas medial and caudoventral to the tract. This organization resembles that reported in the primary olfactory cortex of the rat [Luskin and Price (1983) J. Comp. Neurol. 216:264-291]. The anterograde tracer injections into the piriform cortex and retrograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex and rostral insula label connections from the primary olfactory cortex to nine areas in the caudal orbital cortex, including the agranular insula areas Iam, Iai, Ial, Iapm, and Iapl and areas 14c, 25, 13a, and 13m. The piriform cortex projects most heavily to layer I of these areas. Only Iam, Iapm, and 13a receive a substantial projection to the deeper layers. Areas Iam, Iapm, and 13a were also the only areas that responded with multiunit action potentials to olfactory bulb stimulation in anesthetized animals. Area Iam had predominantly short-latency units, ranging from 4 to 6 msec after olfactory bulb stimulation: Area Iapm had predominantly longer latency units, with some units faithfully following the stimulus at latencies of 70-90 msec. A small region of area 13a had relatively long-latency units. These neocortical connections and electrophysiological responses establish the presence of an olfactory representation in the posterior orbital cortex of the macaque. Similarities in the structure and connections of the primary olfactory cortex suggest a high degree of homology between the rat and monkey and allow inferences about the process of sequential olfactory activation in the primate.

The afferents to this region were investigated by means of retrograde tracing, using six injections of wheatgerm-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. The area of taste cortex was first identified physiologically in all the monkeys used in this anatomical study. The four injections into the middle and posterior part of this region resulted in large numbers of labelled cell bodies in the insular-opercular primary taste cortex. Following the two more anterior injections, label was found predominantly in the caudal part of the cardolateral orbitofrontal cortex itself. None of the injections resulted in labelled cells in the gustatory thalamic nucleus ventralis posterior medialis, pars parvocellularis, although all injections resulted in label of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Afferents were also seen from more anterior parts of the orbitofrontal taste cortex, which may represent backprojections from subsequent taste areas. These results suggest that the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex contains a higher-order taste cortex.;UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL, OXFORD OX1 3UD, ENGLAND;University of Oxford;;;;"BAYLIS, Gordon/0000-0002-4223-9074; Rolls, Edmund/0000-0003-3025-1292";NINDS NIH HHS [R29 NS27296] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;46;137;142;0;8;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;FEB;1995;64;3;;;;;801;812;;10.1016/0306-4522(94)00449-F;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(94)00449-F;;;12;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;QD109;7715788;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1995QD10900019;View Full Record in Web of Science

The main forebrain target of Pf is the striaturn, but the specific striatal regions receiving visceral input via this pathway are unknown. We examined the projections of this region by injecting anterograde tracers into the vagus evoked potential (VEP) focus in Pf of macaque monkeys. The VEP was strongest lateral and anterior to the habenulointerpeduncular tract, but it was distributed across the entire horizontal extent of the ventral half of Pf. All injections produced labeled terminals in the caudate (Cd), especially the Cd tail and the adjacent ventral posterior Pu. Terminations occurred throughout the Cd head and body but spared the most anterior and dorsolateral parts. Injections in more anterior and lateral portions of Pf produced progressively more terminations in Pu, mainly in the precommissural region and the medial aspect of posterior Pu. Dual injections of different tracers revealed overlapping projections with interdigitated strands of striatal terminations from separate regions of Pf as well as the posteromedial to anterolateral topographic gradient of increasing Pf projections to Pu. An injection in the most anteromedial portion of Pf produced strong labeling in the ventral striatum. Thus, Pf transmits viscerosensory information to the associative and limbic territories of the striatum. These findings suggest the broad involvement of homeostatic afferent activity in striatal function and perhaps a role for the striatum in autonomic function.;"Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Shimane 6938501, Japan; Barrow Neurol Inst, Atkinson Res Lab, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA";"Shimane University; Barrow Neurological Institute";Ito, S (corresponding author), Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Shimane 6938501, Japan.;"ito@med.shimane-u.ac.jp; bcraig@chw.edu";;;;;;;96;18;19;0;9;WILEY-LISS;HOBOKEN;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Despite the systemic impact of hypoxia-ischaemia, the resulting brain damage was previously reported to be largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are, therefore also at risk of injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. Here, we report a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11-35 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic (AMT) segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, the diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit. (C) 2016 The Authors.

NR3A is a recently identified unique modulatory subunit that decreases NMDA receptor current and calcium influx. In rodents, NR3A is developmentally expressed, displaying robust expression early in development that declines with age, reaching low levels in the adult brain. A distinct and highly selective pattern of expression is observed in the developing and mature rodent brain, suggesting that NR3A may play a very specific role in NMDA receptor-mediated processes. NR3A expression in other species, however, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the expression of NR3A mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain. Our results indicate that NR3A mRNA is expressed throughout much of the adult primate brain, and at high levels in specific brain regions including the neocortex, substantia nigra par compacta and cerebellum, as well as select areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and hypothamalamus. Western blot analysis reflects that this protein is translated and expressed in multiple brain regions. In contrast to the rat mRNA, our results suggest that NR3A transcript is widely expressed in the adult primate brain. Particular enrichment in some brain areas may reflect brain-region or circuit-specific functions for this NMDA receptor subunit. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo images were acquired with proton-density, T-1 and T-2(*) weightings. Five GE images with increased susceptibility effects were generated using a GESFID sequence, from which T-2* maps were also reconstructed. The first echo of the GESFID sequence (TE = 12.6 ms) produced the best contrast-to-noise ratio (CIN) between the pallidium and the putamen, the pallidium and the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the surrounding white matter, and the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. An increased T-2*-weighting (TE = 37.2 ms) was necessary to maximize C/N between the putamen and the surrounding white matter, and between the subthalamic nucleus and the surrounding white matter. A dual GE sequence with a short TE ( approximate to 10 ms) and a longer one (approximate to 30 ms) thus effectively localizes basal ganglia subregions at 4.7 T. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered similar to 500 mu m deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.;"[Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Maier, Alexander; Aura, Christopher J.; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Unit Cognit Neurophysiol & Imaging, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Leopold, DA (corresponding author), NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS,NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 49 Convent Dr,1E21,MSC 4400, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;leopoldd@mail.nih.gov;Maier, Alexander/B-7489-2009;"Maier, Alexander/0000-0002-7250-502X; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360";"National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National Eye Institute";"National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))";This work was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Eye Institute.

DCS is defined as the main region in which axons from ipsilateral medial agranular cortex (AGm) terminate within the striatum. In this double-labeling study, we placed a green axonal tracer in area AGm and a red one in an additional brain region. We examined the spatial relationship between terminals from area AGm and other portions of the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical network involved in directed attention and its dysfunction, hemispatial neglect, in the rat. These include lateral agranular cortex (AGl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO), and secondary visual cortex (MM). One important finding is the presence of a dense focus of labeled axons within DCS after injections in cortical area PPC or Oc2M. In these foci, axons from PPC or Oc2M extensively overlap and interdigitate with axons from cortical area AGm. Additionally, retrograde labeling of striatal neurons, along with double anterograde labeling, suggests that axons from cortical area AGm and AGl cross and possibly make contact with the dendritic processes of single medium spiny neurons. Axons from thalamic nucleus LP were observed to form a dense band dorsal to DCS which is similar to that seen following PPC injections, and a significant number of LP axons were also observed within DCS. Projections from thalamic nucleus VL are present in the dense dorsolateral AGm band that abuts the external capsule, are densest in the dorsolateral striatum, and were not observed in DCS. These results extend previous findings that DCS receives input from diverse cortical areas and thalamic nuclei which are themselves interconnected. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We provide histological descriptions of the major sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the superior colliculus (SC) of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus has the six layers typical of strepsirrhine primates, with matching pairs of magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers, one of each pair for each eye. Unlike most primates, magnocellular and parvocellular layers exhibit only small differences in cell size. All layers express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), reflecting terminations of retinal inputs, and the expression of VGLUT2 is much less dense in the koniocellular layers. Parvalbumin is densely expressed in all layers, while SMI-32 is densely expressed only in the magnocellular layers. The adjoining pulvinar complex has a posterior nucleus with strong VGLUT2 expression, reflecting terminations from the SC. The SC is laminated with dense expression of VGLUT2 in the upper superficial gray layer, reflecting terminations from the retina. The ventral (MGNv), medial, and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate complex are only moderately differentiated, although patches of dense VGLUT2 expression are found along the outer border of MGNv. The ventroposterior nucleus has darkly stained cells in Nissl stained sections, and narrow septa separating patchy regions of dense VGLUT2 expression that likely represent different body parts. Overall, these structures resemble those in other strepsirrhine primates, although they are smaller, with the sensory nuclei appearing to occupy proportionately more of the dorsal thalamus than in larger primates.;"[Saraf, Mansi P.; Balaram, Pooja; Kaas, Jon H.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21 Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Pifferi, Fabien] CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, MECADEV, UMR 7179, Brunoy, France; [Kennedy, Henry] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, INSERM, Stem Cell & Brain Res Inst,U1208, Bron, France; [Kennedy, Henry] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Primate Neurobiol, State Key Lab Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Balaram, Pooja] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA USA";"Vanderbilt University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Allen Institute for Brain Science";Kaas, JH (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 Wilson Hall,111 21 Ave South, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;jon.h.kaas@vanderbilt.edu;Kennedy, Henry/B-9636-2013;"Kennedy, Henry/0000-0002-2796-7663; Pifferi, Fabien/0000-0001-9316-1935; Balaram, Pooja/0009-0000-0500-9635";"Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-11-IDEX-0007, ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-14-CE13-0033, ANR-15-CE32-0016]; National Eye Institute [EY002686, EY025422]; French National Research Agency; Universite de Lyon; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-CE13-0033, ANR-15-CE32-0016] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)";"Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Universite de Lyon; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))";"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Numbers: ANR-11-IDEX-0007, ANR-11-LABX-0042, ANR-14-CE13-0033, ANR-15-CE32-0016; National Eye Institute, Grant/Award Numbers: EY002686, EY025422; French National Research Agency; Universite de Lyon";;65;3;3;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

It is also a site of multisensory convergence, with robust somatosensory and auditory responses. In this study, we investigated the cerebral cortical sources of somatosensory and auditory inputs to CM by injecting retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. A companion paper describes the thalamic connections of CM (Hackett et al., J. Comp. Neurol. [this issue]. The likely cortical sources of somatosensory input to CM were the adjacent retroinsular cortex (area Ri) and granular insula (Ig). In addition, CM had reliable connections with areas Tpt and TPO, which are sites of multisensory integration. CM also had topographic connections with other auditory areas. As expected, connections with adjacent caudal auditory areas were stronger than connections with rostral areas. Surprisingly, the connections with the core were concentrated along its medial side, suggesting that there may be a medial-lateral division of function within the core. Additional injections into caudal lateral auditory area (CL) and Tpt showed similar connections with Ri, Ig, and TPO. In contrast to CM injections, these lateral injections had inputs from parietal area 7a and had a preferential connection with the lateral (gyral) part of Tpt. Taken together, the findings indicate that CM may receive somatosensory input from nearby areas along the fundus of the lateral sulcus. The differential connections of CM compared with adjacent areas provide additional evidence for the functional specialization of the individual auditory belt areas.;"Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Hearing & Speech Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, H-1394 Budapest, Hungary; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA";"Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research; Vanderbilt University; Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Research Centre for Natural Sciences; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Columbia University";Smiley, JF (corresponding author), Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, 140 Old Orangeburg Rd, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA.;smiley@nki.rfmh.org;"Javitt, Daniel/U-6015-2019; Ulbert, Istvan/F-2213-2010";Lakatos, Peter/0000-0003-0221-4021;"FIC NIH HHS [R03 TW05674] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH067183, R01 MH61989] Funding Source: Medline";"FIC NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";;;149;135;135;2;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

A key parameter that the nervous system regulates is the level of force to exert against an object during tasks such as grasping. Previous studies indicate that the basal ganglia do not exhibit increased activity with increasing amplitude of force, although these conclusions are based mainly on the putamen. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which regions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex display increased activity when producing pinch-grip contractions of increasing force amplitude. We found that the internal portion of the globus pallidus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) had a positive increase in percent signal change with increasing force, whereas the external portion of the globus pallidus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, and caudate did not. In the thalamus we found that the ventral thalamic regions increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude. The contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor/somatosensory (M1/S1) cortices had a positive increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude, and the contralateral M1/S1 had a greater increase in percent signal change and activation volume than the ipsilateral side. We also found that deactivation did not change across force in the motor cortex and basal ganglia, but that the ipsilateral M1/S1 had greater deactivation than the contralateral M1/S1. Our findings provide direct evidence that GPi and STN regulate the amplitude of force output. These findings emphasize the heterogeneous role of individual nuclei of the basal ganglia in regulating specific parameters of motor output.;"Univ Illinois, Dept Movement Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Phys Therapy, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Neurol & Rehabil, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Rush Presbyterian St Lukes Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA";"University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Rush University";Vaillancourt, DE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Movement Sci, 1919 W Taylor St,650 AHSB,M-C 994, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;court1@uic.edu;Corcos, Daniel/AAX-9971-2021;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01-NS-28127, R01 NS052318, R01 NS028127, R01-NS-40902, R01-NS-52318, R01 NS052318-03, R01 NS040902] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;57;89;90;0;11;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Both ligands were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 via nucleophilic displacement of the corresponding 2-chloropyridine precursor with [F-18] potassium fluoride. [F-18]MK-1312 was found to have a suitable signal for quantification of mGluR1 receptors in nonhuman primates and was more thoroughly characterized. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-1312 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the known distribution of mGluR1, with the highest uptake in the cerebellum, moderate uptake in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortical regions, and lowest uptake in the caudate and putamen. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human cerebellum homogenates confirmed that [F-18]MK-1312 binds to a single site with a Bmax/Kd ratio of 132 and 98, respectively. PET studies in rhesus monkey with [F-18]MK-1312 showed high brain uptake and a regional distribution consistent with in vitro autoradiography results. Blockade of [F-18]MK-1312 uptake with mGluR1 allosteric antagonist MK-5435 dose-dependently reduced tracer uptake in all regions of gray matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake. This revealed a large specific signal useful for determination of mGluR1 receptor occupancy in rhesus monkey. Taken together, these results are promising for clinical PET studies with [F-18]MK-1312 to determine mGluR1 occupancy of MK-5435. Synapse 65: 125-135, 2011.

Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the medial pulvinar, however, reveal retrogradely filled neurons up to 2.0 mm from the injection edge. Serial section reconstruction (n = 18) confirmed that retrogradely filled neurons projected to the injection site and showed that they had additional long-range collaterals within the posterior pulvinar. Arrays of small, beaded terminations occurred in multiple foci along the collaterals. Terminal arrays were up to 1.0 mm in length; foci were separated by about 0.7 mm. Somata were large (average area = 220 mu m(2)), and dendritic arbors were radiate and also large (about 1.0 mm in diameter), but without either the appendages of classical interneurons or the hairlike spines characteristic of radiate pulvinocortical projection neurons. Double labeling for BDA and parvalbumin (PV) or BDA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) indicated that these large neurons were positive for both PV and GABA. Double labeling for PV and GABA, or PV and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) revealed a small number of similarly large neurons in the posterior pulvinar that were positive for both substances. Thus, we propose that these neurons are a novel class of inhibitory interneuron, longer range than the classic thalamic local circuit interneurons. Future questions include how these neurons relate to other inhibitory systems and specific postsynaptic populations and whether they are located preferentially within the posterior pulvinar, possibly related to the multimodal character of this thalamic region.";RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan;RIKEN;Rockland, KS (corresponding author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;rockland@brain.riken.jp;;Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785;;;;;68;19;19;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

We correlated changes in PV and Cal staining patterns with the well-documented developmental sequence for primate striate cortex neuron generation and maturation, synaptogenesis, and thalamocortical axon interactions in an attempt to deduce a functional role for these proteins. Our major finding is that Cal and PV have diametrically opposed developmental patterns except in layer 1. At F60 days both are present only in neurons of layer 1 and the number of labeled cell bodies and processes increases up to F125 days. Almost all Cal+ and PV+ cells in layer 1 disappear by P12 weeks. Cal is present by F113 days in pyramidal and stellate neurons, particularly layers 4-6. The number and staining density of cells in layers 2-6 increases up to birth and then both decline by P9-12 weeks. Supragranular layers show a second increase in Cal labeling from P20-36 weeks, and then there is a slow decline to the adult pattern which is reached by P1-2 years. Cell bodies in layers 4A, 4C-alpha, and deep 4C-beta are heavily Cal+ during pre-and early post-natal periods, but upper 4C-beta remains unlabeled. PV is not seen until F155-162 days in layers 2-6. Large stellate and a few pyramidal cells appear first in layers 5/6 and 4C-alpha, but PV+ cell stellate neurons are found in all layers except 4C-beta by P6 weeks. Layer 4C-beta contains a few PV+ cell bodies at P3 weeks, and light neuropile 4C-beta exceeds that of 4C-alpha. Striate cortex has an adult pattern of cell number and neuropile density by P20 weeks. These developmental patterns suggest that the highest density of Cal cell body staining does not correlate with synaptogenesis, or the postnatal critical period of visually driven, binocular interactions. Rather Cal appears when lateral geniculate axons arrive in cortex, persists over the entire span of thalamocortical interactions, and disappears during the decline of cortical plasticity. The appearance of PV is highly correlated with the onset of complex visually driven activity at birth, while both the number of PV+ cell bodies and the density of PV+ neuropile reach adult levels coincident with the completion of thalamocortical connections.;"UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT OPHTALMOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA; UNIV FRIBOURG, INST HISTOL & GEN EMBRYOL, CH-1700 FRIBOURG, SWITZERLAND";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Fribourg";HENDRICKSON, AE (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT BIOL STRUCT, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.;;Celio, Marco R/O-5193-2014;Celio, Marco R/0000-0002-3623-842X;NEI NIH HHS [EY04536, EY01208, EY01730] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;89;140;140;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV ofMacaca fascicularisandmulattamonkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with smallen passantboutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod. This relationship would serve to maintain relatively small receptive fields within the topographic representation of the face.;"[Andrew, Dona Lee E.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Occupat Therapy, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [Andrew, Dona Lee E.; May, Paul J.; Warren, Susan] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [May, Paul J.] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Jackson, MS 39216 USA";"University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center";Warren, S (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol & Anat Sci, Jackson, MS 39216 USA.;"dleandrew@aol.com; swarren@umc.edu";May, Paul J/R-7564-2019;;"NIH, NINDS [NS27996]; Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation; NIH [EY09762, EY014263]";"NIH, NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";This research was supported in part by NIH, NINDS NS27996 (SW), a grant from the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation, and by NIH grant EY09762 and EY014263 to PM and SW.;;58;2;2;0;0;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5129;;;FRONT NEUROANAT;Front.

Design: EEG, EMG, and EOG were recorded continuously via implanted telemetry from 5 unrestrained male rhesus monkeys housed individually under a 16:8 light-dark cycle (LD 16:8; L = 13 lux; D = 0 lux). Results: In a LID 16:8 cycle, all 5 monkeys demonstrated a long period of consolidated sleep during the 8-h dark period. On average, sleep accounted for 89.2% of the 8-h dark period and 25.2% of the 16-hour light period. REM sleep occupied 23% of total sleep time over 24 h, or 10.7% of the total time. The average length of the consolidated sleep (CS) period was 10.5 h, although the time of CS onset was variable. In contrast, the end of CS, and thus the onset of consolidated wakefulness (CW) demonstrated very little variation, typically occurring within 2 min of light onset. Ultradian NREM-REM cycles with periods of approximately 60 min were also observed. EEG delta activity during NREM sleep, thought to reflect the homeostatic sleep process, peaked at 3-4 h after CS onset. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of longterm, unrestrained sleep monitoring in nonhuman primates using fully-implantable biotelemetry. With minor exceptions, most notably a delay in peak delta activity, sleep-wake architecture, regulation, and consolidation in rhesus monkeys strongly resembles that of humans. These results demonstrate that the unrestrained rhesus monkey is an excellent biomedical model for human sleep.";"[Hsieh, Kung-Chiao; Robinson, Edward L.; Fuller, Charles A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hsieh, Kung-Chiao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles";Fuller, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;cafuller@ucdavis.edu;;;"NASA [NNJ041-IF44G]; CNPRC NIH [RR00169]";"NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); CNPRC NIH";This work was Supported by NASA grant NNJ041-IF44G and by the CNPRC NIH base grant RR00169.

As a result of this reorganization, intact inputs from the face expand into the deafferented hand representations. Dorsal column injuries also result in permanent deficits in the use of digits for precision grip and a loss of fractionated movements of the digits. We determined whether the chronic loss of sensory inputs and the behavioral deficits caused by lesions of the dorsal columns in adult macaque monkeys affect organization of the motor cortex. The results show that, in the primary motor cortex, intracortical microstimulation evokes extension-flexion movements of the thumb at significantly fewer sites compared with the normal monkeys. There is a corresponding increase in the adduction-abduction movements. Furthermore, there is a significant increase in the thresholds of the currents required to evoke movements of the digits. Thus, long-term sensory loss in adult monkeys does not change the overall topography of the movement representation in the motor cortex but results in changes in the details of movement representations.;"[Kambi, Niranjan; Tandon, Shashank; Mohammed, Hisham; Lazar, Leslee; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH-8, Manesar 122050, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850; tandon, shashank/0000-0002-8109-0129; Lazar, Leslee/0000-0002-2564-7324";Wellcome Trust [063259/Z/00/Z];Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust);This work was supported by Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellowship Grant 063259/Z/00/Z (N.J.).

Given the importance of the marginal zone in nociception, this conclusion has raised doubts about the significance of the role of the ventrobasal complex in nociception. We have reexamined this projection using injections of the retrograde tracer, cholera toxin subunit B, into one side of the lateral thalamus in macaque monkeys. The injections were confined to the ventrobasal complex (with minimal spread to adjacent nuclei that do not receive spinal projections) in two animals. Many retrogradely labeled neurons were found in lamina I (as well as in lamina V) of the contralateral spinal and medullary dorsal hem. The results an consistent with the view that neurons in the marginal zone contribute prominently to the spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic projections to the VPL and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei. This pathway is likely to be important for the sensory-discriminative processing of nociceptive information with respect to the location and intensity of painful stimuli.

Here we describe responses of macaque PIVC neurons to three-dimensional (3D) vestibular and optic flow stimulation. We found robust vestibular responses to both translational and rotational stimuli in the retroinsular (Ri) and adjacent secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. PIVC neurons did not respond to optic flow stimulation, and vestibular responses were similar in darkness and during visual fixation. Cells in the upper bank and tip of the lateral sulcus (Ri and S2) responded to sinusoidal vestibular stimuli with modulation at the first harmonic frequency and were directionally tuned. Cells in the lower bank of the lateral sulcus (mostly Ri) often modulated at the second harmonic frequency and showed either bimodal spatial tuning or no tuning at all. All directions of 3D motion were represented in PIVC, with direction preferences distributed approximately uniformly for translation, but showing a preference for roll rotation. Spatiotemporal profiles of responses to translation revealed that half of PIVC cells followed the linear velocity profile of the stimulus, one-quarter carried signals related to linear acceleration (in the form of two peaks of direction selectivity separated in time), and a few neurons followed the derivative of linear acceleration (jerk). In contrast, mainly velocity-coding cells were found in response to rotation. Thus, PIVC comprises a large functional region in macaque areas Ri and S2, with robust responses to 3D rotation and translation, but is unlikely to play a significant role in visual/vestibular integration for self-motion perception.;"[Chen, Aihua; DeAngelis, Gregory C.; Angelaki, Dora E.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [DeAngelis, Gregory C.] Univ Rochester, Ctr Visual Sci, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA";"Washington University (WUSTL); University of Rochester";Angelaki, DE (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, POB 8108,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;angelaki@pcg.wustl.edu;;DeAngelis, Gregory/0000-0002-1635-1273;National Institutes of Health [R01-EY017866, EY016178];National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01-EY017866 (to D.

There were 1.4 +/- 0.2 million and 341 +/- 54 million neurons in the LGN and area 17, respectively. In each animal, a larger LGN on one side was in register with a larger area 17 of the cortex on the same side. Furthermore, asymmetry in the number of neurons in both the LGN and area 17 favored the right side. However, because of small variations across subjects, correlation between the total neuron number in LGN and area 17 was weak (r(2) = 0.29). These results suggest that the final numbers of neurons in these visual centers may be established independently or by multiple factors controlling elimination of initially overproduced neurons.;YALE UNIV,SCH MED,NEUROBIOL SECT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06520;Yale University;;;;;"NEI NIH HHS [EY02593] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [MH38546] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [P0-NS22801] Funding Source: Medline";"NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;41;20;20;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;MAY-JUN;1996;13;3;;;;;585;590;;10.1017/S0952523800008269;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800008269;;;6;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";UH528;8782386;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1996UH52800019;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we used injections of retrograde tracers in the lateral portion of the monkey MD to assess the locations of labeled cells in subcortical structures. Three main patterns were identified in the distribution of subcortical connections. We found that the claustrum, superior colliculus and ventral midbrain regions were heavily labeled in the cases with injections in caudoventral MD. In these cases, labeled cells were also found in either the periaqueductal gray or zona incerta, depending on the specific case. In one case with an injection in anterodorsal MD, labeled cells were most numerous in the structures of the ventral midbrain, especially the ventral tegmental area. Finally, the claustrum and superior colliculus contained the largest percentage of labeled subcortical cells in cases with injections in ventrolateral MD. These three patterns of subcortical label corresponded to three equally distinctive trends in the distribution of MD connections with the cortex in these same cases [J Comp Neurol 473 (2004) 107]. Very few labeled cells were found in other areas such as the amygdala, globus pallidus and deep cerebellar nuclei, suggesting that pathways leading from these structures to dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices are not likely to include the lateral divisions of MD. In concert, these findings show that particular locales within lateral MD receive distinct profiles of subcortical afferents, and project into specific neocortical domains, suggesting that these different sites within lateral MD may participate in functionally distinct circuits of information processing.

First, direct thalamic input can determine the size of the initial activating RF at high contrast. Second, lateral connections can enlarge the RF at low contrast by pooling information from larger regions of cortex that are otherwise ineffective when high contrast thalamic input is driving the cortical neuron. Thirdly, feedback from extrastriate cortex (possibly together with overlap or interdigitation of coactive lateral connectional fields within V1) can provide a large and stimulus specific surround modulatory field. The stimulus specificity of the interactions between the center and surround fields, may be due to the orderly, matching structure and different scales of intra-areal and feedback projection excitatory pathways. The observed activity changes of single recorded excitatory neurons could be a result of the relative weight of excitation on the excitatory neurons themselves and on local inhibitory interneurons that synapse on them. Inhibitory basket neurons, driven by the local excitatory neurons, could govern local interactions between cortical patches of different tuning properties, resulting in more distant changes in excitatory input in the laterally connected intra-areal neuronal pools.;"Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; CUNY City Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10031 USA";"Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY)";Lund, JS (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Moran Eye Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 50 N Med Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY12781] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;77;134;135;0;9;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-50815-5;PROG BRAIN RES;;;2002;136;;;;;;373;388;;;;;;16;Neurosciences;"Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";Neurosciences & Neurology;BW09C;12143395;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000180831800029;View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, many nuclei in the human thalamus, with projections to the cerebral cortex, contain a large number of neurons with intense BuChE activity. Thalamocortical projections subserve a variety of cognitive functions. Due to genetic mutations, there are individuals who do not have detectable BuChE activity (silent BuChE). While the prevalence of silent BuChE is only 1:100,000 in European and American populations, it is 1:24 in the Vysya community in Coimbatore, India. To examine whether there are differences in cognitive functions between individuals with silent BuChE and those expressing normal BuChE (wild-type), twelve healthy individuals with silent BuChE and thirteen healthy individuals with wildtype BuChE, all from the Vysya community in Coimbatore, were tested for cognitive function using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics test battery. The silent BuChE group was slightly faster on simple reaction tasks, but slower on a visual perceptual matching task. Furthermore, discriminant function analyses correctly classified 11/12 silent and 8/13 wild-type BuChE subjects (76% correct classification overall) based on BuChE status.

In the same animals, neuroanatomical tracers were placed into electrophysiologically identified sites in PV and/or the second somatosensory area (S2). Foci of anterograde and retrograde label were related to electrophysiological maps of cortical areas and cortical and thalamic architecture. The results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Multiunit recordings from cortex on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus demonstrate that PV is somatotopically organized, with the face representation adjoining area 3b and the hindlimb and tail representations away from this border in cortex deep on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus. The forelimb representation is caudal in PV adjacent to the S2 forelimb representation. The body surface representation in PV approximates a mirror image of that in S2; (2) Areas PV and S2 are less myelinated and have less cytochrome oxidase enzyme activity than area 3b; (3) The ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI) of the thalamus provides the major somatosensory projections to PV. PV is reciprocally connected with VPI and anterior pulvinar; (4) PV has ipsilateral cortical connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, and M1 and higher order somatosensory fields, and at least most of these connections are somatotopically matched; and (5) Callosal connections of PV are with S2 and PV of the other cerebral hemisphere. These results further establish PV as one of at least four somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus of primates.

In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a 'fast lane' reserved to highspeed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.

In the developing animal brain, including those of non-human primates (NHPs), anaesthetics induce apoptotic cell death. We previously reported that a 5h isoflurane (ISO) exposure in infant NHPs increases apoptosis 13-fold compared with control animals. However, the majority of paediatric surgeries requiring anaesthesia are of shorter durations. We examined whether 3 h ISO exposure similarly increases neuroapoptosis in the NHP developing brain. Methods: Six-day-old NHP infants (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to 3h of a surgical plane of ISO (n = 6) or to room air (n = 5). Following exposure, NHP brains were screened for neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis using activated caspase-3 immunolabelling and unbiased stereology. Results: ISO treatment increased apoptosis (neurones + oligodendrocyte) to greater than four times that in the control group [mean density of apoptotic profiles: 57 (SD 22) mm(-3) vs 14 (SD 5.2) mm(-3), respectively]. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis was evenly distributed throughout the white matter whereas neuroapoptosis occurred primarily in the cortex (all regions), caudate, putamen and thalamus. Conclusions: A 3 h exposure to ISO is sufficient to induce widespread neurotoxicity in the developing primate brain. These results are relevant for clinical medicine, as many surgical and diagnostic procedures in children require anaesthesia durations similar to those modelled here. Further research is necessary to identify long-termneurobehavioural consequences of 3h ISO exposure.;"[Noguchi, K. K.; Manzella, F. M.; Olney, J.

In normal weight monkeys (2.4-4.1 kg body wt), the average concentration of MeHg (calculated as T-Hg minus I-Hg) was about the same in all brain sites, except the pituitary-3.0 mu g Hg/g at 6 months, 4.2 mu g/g at 12 months, and 4.3 mu g Hg/g at 18 months. MeHg concentrations in the pituitary were about 50% of those in the other brain sites. In a group of monkeys that were kept unexposed for 6 months following 12 months of MeHg exposure, T1/2 for MeHg was about 37 days in all brain sites, with the exception of the pituitary, where it was shorter. The concentration of I-Hg increased in all brain sites, but especially in the thalamus and pituitary, with the time of MeHg exposure. In most brain sites, I-Hg constituted about 9% of T-Hg at 6 and 12 months, and 12% of T-Hg at 18 months. In the pituitary, I-Hg increased from 20% of T-Hg at 6 months to 46% at 18 months. Elimination T1/2 for I-Hg was extremely long, 230-540 days in most brain sites and considerably longer in the thalamus and pituitary. The concentration of I-Hg in the thalamus did not decrease during the clearance period (6 months), while I-Hg in the pituitary continued to increase in spite of no additional exposure. The MeHg exposed monkeys had several times higher I-Hg concentrations in the brain than monkeys exposed to HgCl2, indicating that I-Hg was formed by demethylation of MeHg in the brain, and not by brain uptake of I-Hg formed by demethylation elsewhere in the body. There were large variations in the relative concentration of I-Hg between individual monkeys, but not between brain sites (except thalamus and pituitary). Obese monkeys (5.0-6.1 kg body wt) exposed to MeHg had higher concentrations of both MeHg and I-Hg than normal weight monkeys in all brain sites, except in the pituitary.

Migration of layer IV neurons into the cortical plate just precedes thalamocortical invasion, suggesting that these neurons could cue or tropically direct thalamic ingrowth, To explore the interactions of layer IV neurons and their thalamocortical input, we administered a mitotic inhibitor methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) intraperitoneally to timed pregnant hamsters on E14 when layer IV neurons are normally being generated in striate cortex. Reduced numbers of cortical neurons overall, the absence of small-diameter granule neurons, and the absence of the zone of reduced density of callosally projecting neurons suggest that neither the depletion of layer IV cells in the ventricular zone nor thalamic afferents in the subplate or cortical plate respecify the later generated cohort of neurons (presumptive layer II/III neurons) to acquire morphological and connectional properties of layer IV. Dil injections into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) of animals from embryonic (E15) and postnatal (P7) ages shaw that the final position of thalamic axons with respect to layer V is not affected by the absence of E14 neurons. In the normal visual cortex, geniculocortical axons have begun their arborization in their presumptive target layer in the upper cortex immediately below the undifferentiated cortical plate on P4, while in MAM animals, this process occurs 1 d later. The extent and density of arborization is much reduced in the thinner cortex of the MAM animals. We thus find no evidence for instruction of migrating neurons by thalamocortical areas to assume the layer IV phenotype; if instruction does occur it must take place in a very restricted time window. Thalamic axons can also find their laminar position in the absence of cells of this phonotype.";CORNELL UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA;Cornell University;;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS19245] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;84;19;19;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Previous studies showed that corticothalamic input is essential for the development of thalamocortical projections, but less is known about the potential role of this reciprocal connection in the development of retinal projections. Here, we show a deficit of retinal innervation in the dLGN around E18.5 in Tra2 beta conditional knockout (cKO) cortexless mice, an age when apoptosis occurs along the thalamocortical tract and in some dLGN neurons. In vivo electrophysiology experiments in the dLGN further confirmed the loss of functional retinal input. Experiments with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced V1 lesion as well as Fezf2 cKO mice confirmed that the disruption of connections between the dLGN and V1 lead to abnormal retinal projections to the dLGN. Interestingly, retinal projections to the ventral Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (vLGN) and Superior Colliculus (SC) were normal in all 3 mice models. Finally, we show that the cortexless mice had worse performance than control mice in a go-no go task with visual cues. Our results provide evidence that the wiring of visual circuit from the retina to the dLGN and V1 thereafter is coordinated at a surprisingly early stage of circuit development.;"[Diao, Yupu; Cui, Liyuan; Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Jiayi] Fudan Univ, Inst Brain Sci, State Key Lab Med Neurobiol, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Diao, Yupu; Cui, Liyuan; Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Jiayi] Fudan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Brain Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Burbridge, Timothy J.; Han, Wenqi; Sestan, Nenad; Crair, Michael C.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Wirth, Brunhilde] Univ Cologne, Ctr Mol Med Cologne, Inst Genet, Inst Human Genet, D-55322 Cologne, Germany";"Fudan University; Fudan University; Yale University; University of Cologne";Zhang, JY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Med, Rm 1006,Mingdao Bldg,131 Dongan Rd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;jiayizhang@fudan.edu.cn;;"Wirth, Brunhilde/0000-0003-4051-5191; Zhang, Jiayi/0000-0002-1575-0723";"National Science Foundation of China [31271158, 31421091, 31422025]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal [13PJ1401000]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2015AA020512]; National Institutes of Health [MH105972, MH103339, EY023105, EY015788]; Young 1000 Plan";"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Young 1000 Plan";"National Science Foundation of China (31271158, 31421091, and 31422025 to J.Z.); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal (13PJ1401000 to J.Z.); the Young 1000 Plan and Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2015AA020512 to J.Z.); National Institutes of Health (grants MH105972, MH103339 to N.S. and grants EY023105, EY015788 to M.C.).";;45;12;12;4;21;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

However, the actual function of these large nuclei of the thalamus remains unknown. In contrast to the nearby lateral geniculate nucleus, the LP-P complex does not receive any substantial direct projections from the retina. Its main visual inputs come from the mesencephalon and the neocortex. Most cells in the LP-P complex behave like cortical units. They are tuned to the orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies of the visual stimulus. In addition, most units are binocular and sensitive to relative retinal disparity. Despite their multiple inputs, the LP-P complex cells form an homogeneous population and their overall properties do not reflect those of a given cortical or subcortical area. On the basis of its afferent and efferent connectivity, it has been proposed that the LP-P complex may serve as a relay of an extrageniculate ascendant pathway which originates from the superior colliculus, and/or provide another route for the geniculo-striate input to reach the extrastriate areas. Despite the fact that there is some electro-physiological evidence of such functions, it is now often suggested that the LP-P complex may integrate its multiple inputs and be involved in functions which go beyond those of a simple thalamic relay. Recent findings suggest that the LP-P complex might play a role in visual spatial attention.;"UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT BIOL, MONTREAL H3C 3J7, QUEBEC, CANADA; HOP ST ANTOINE, DEPT OPHTALMOL, F-75571 PARIS 12, FRANCE";"Universite de Montreal; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Saint-Antoine - APHP";CASANOVA, C (corresponding author), UNIV SHERBROOKE, FAC MED, DEPT OPHTALMOL, SHERBROOKE J1H 5N4, QUEBEC, CANADA.;;;;;;;;151;11;11;0;1;MASSON EDITEUR;MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9;21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE;0021-7948;;;J PHYSIOLOGY PARIS;;;1991;85;1;;;;;44;57;;;;;;14;Physiology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Physiology;GC265;1941643;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991GC26500006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, we compared activity levels evoked during two tasks with essentially identical visual stimulation requiring different attentional demands. During a featural-attention task, the subjects had to discriminate the orientation of a grating: during a control spatial-attention task, they had to localize the position of a target point. Comparison of the resulting activity maps revealed attention-dependent changes in metabolic activity in portions of the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the magnocellular-recipient layers 4C alpha and 4B of the striate cortex. In these early stages of the visual system, attention to the orientation of the grating suppressed the metabolic activity in a retinotopically specific band peripheral to the representation of the stimulus. These results favor an early selection model of attention. After a thalamic attention dependent gating mechanism, irrelevant visual information outside the focus of attention may be suppressed at the level of the striate cortex, which would then result in an increased signal-to-noise ratio for the processing of the attended feature in higher-tier, less retinotopically organized, extrastriate visual areas.;"Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro Psychofysiol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, NMR Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA";"KU Leuven; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";Vanduffel, W (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Neuro Psychofysiol, Campus Gasthuisberg,Herestr 49, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.;;;Orban, Guy/0000-0002-8179-9584;;;;;82;126;130;0;9;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

As with a cable, spine neck resistance (Rneck) increases with increasing neck length and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the neck. A synaptic current entering a spine with a high Rneck will lead to greater local depolarization in the spine head than would a similar input applied to a spine with a lower Rneck. This could make spines with high Rneck more sensitive to plastic changes since voltage sensitive conductances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels can be more easily activated. This hypothesis was tested using serial section electron microscopic reconstructions of thalamocortical spine synapses and spine necks located on spiny stellate cells and corticothalamic cells from area 17 of cats. Thalamic axons and corticothalamic neurons were labeled by injections of the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized cats and spiny stellates were filled intracellularly in vivo with horseradish peroxidase. Twenty-eight labeled spines that formed synapses with dLGN boutons were collected from three spiny stellate and four corticothalamic cells and reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs. Spine length, spine diameter, and the area of the postsynaptic density were measured from the 3D reconstructions and Rneck of the spine was estimated. No correlation was found between the postsynaptic density size and the estimated spine Rneck. This suggests that forms of plasticity that lead to larger synapses are independent of spine neck resistance. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:20582066, 2013.

Nevertheless, the role of corticothalamic circuits in sensory processing remains a mystery. In the visual system, afferents from retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from LGN to primary visual cortex (V1) are organized into functionally distinct parallel processing streams. Physiological evidence suggests corticogeniculate feedback may be organized into parallel streams; however, little is known about the diversity of corticogeniculate neurons, their local computations, or the structure-function relationship among corticogeniculate neurons. We used a virus-mediated approach to label and reconstruct the complete dendritic and local axonal arbors of identified corticogeniculate neurons in the macaque monkey. Our results reveal morphological substrates for parallel streams of corticogeniculate feedback based on distinct classes of neurons in V1 and V2.

This study aimed to investigate the cellular localization and distribution of TGF-beta 1, GDNF, and PDGF-BB in the CNS of adult rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Seven adult rhesus macaques were included in the study. The protein levels of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord were analyzed by western blotting. The expression and location of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the brain and spinal cord was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was detected by in situ hybridization. The molecular weight of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the homogenate of spinal cord was 25 KDa, 30 KDa, and 34 KDa, respectively. Immunolabeling revealed GDNF was ubiquitously distributed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, basal nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. TGF-beta 1 was least distributed and found only in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and PDGF-BB expression was also limited and present only in the brainstem and spinal cord. Besides, TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF were localized in the astrocytes and microglia of spinal cord and hippocampus, and their expression was mainly found in the cytoplasm and primary dendrites. The mRNA of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was localized to neuronal subpopulations in the spinal cord and cerebellum. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1, GDNF and PDGF-BB may be associated with neuronal survival, neural regeneration and functional recovery in the CNS of adult rhesus macaques, providing the potential insights into the development or refinement of therapies based on these factors.;"[Li, Hui; Mu, De-Zhi] Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Key Lab Birth Defects & Related Dis Women & Childr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Li, Hui] Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Intens Care Unit Gynecol & Obstet, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Dan, Qi-Qin; Chen, Yan-Jun; Chen, Li; Zhang, Hong-Tian; Wang, Ting-Hua] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Inst Neurol Dis, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China";"Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University";"Mu, DZ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Key Lab Birth Defects & Related Dis Women & Childr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Wang, TH (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Inst Neurol Dis, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.";"mudz@scu.edu.cn; Wangth_email@163.com";;Chen, Yan-Jun/0000-0002-1561-991X;;;;;108;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0364-3190;1573-6903;;NEUROCHEM RES;Neurochem.

In the present study, somatotopical representations of the PMdr were electrophysiologically identified in the macaque monkey, and the distribution of corticostriatal input from the forelimb region of the PMdr was analyzed in relation to its thalamocortical and intracortical (with the frontal lobe) connections. Results have revealed that (1) the forelimb is represented predominantly in the PMdr, while only a few sites representing other body parts are distributed as embedded within the forelimb representation; (2) the corticostriatal input zone is located in the striatal cell bridges and their surroundings; (3) the cells of origin of the thalamocortical projections to the PMdr are located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus, the oral divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, area X, the caudal divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the intralaminar nuclear group; (4) the PMdr is interconnected primarily with higher-order motor-related areas and dorsal area 46. These data indicate that the input-output pattern of the PMdr resembles those of the presupplementary motor area and the rostral cingulate motor area, and that the PMdr may play critical roles in higher-order motor functions.

Using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics, social status differences were found in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) WM and cortico-thalamic tracts, with subordinates showing higher WM structural integrity (measured as fractional anisotropy, FA) than dominant animals. 5HTT genotype-related differences were detected in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, where s-variants had higher FA than I/I animals. Status by 5HTT interaction effects were found in (1) external capsule (middle longitudinal fasciculus), (2) parietal WM, and (3) short-range PFC tracts, with opposite effects in dominant and subordinate animals. In most regions showing FA differences, opposite differences were detected in radial diffusivity, but none in axial diffusivity, suggesting that differences in tract integrity likely involve differences in myelin. These findings highlight that differences in social rank are associated with differences in WM structural integrity in juveniles, particularly in tracts connecting prefrontal, sensory processing, motor and association regions, sometimes modulated by 5HTT genotype. Differences in these tracts were associated with increased emotional reactivity in subordinates, particularly with higher submissive and fear behaviors.;"[Howell, Brittany R.; Sanchez, Mar M.] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Howell, Brittany R.; Godfrey, Jodi; Michopoulos, Vasiliki; Wilson, Mark E.; Sanchez, Mar M.] Emory Univ, Div Dev & Cognit Neurosci, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Gutman, David A.] Emory Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Div Neuropharmacol & Neurol Dis, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Zhang, Xiaodong] Emory Univ, Yerkes Imaging Ctr, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Nair, Govind; Hu, Xiaoping] Emory Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Nair, Govind; Hu, Xiaoping] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA";"Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; Emory University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology";Sanchez, MM (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;mmsanch@emory.edu;"Gutman, David/U-2713-2018; Michopoulos, Vasiliki/C-7342-2014";"Gutman, David/0000-0002-1386-8701; Michopoulos, Vasiliki/0000-0003-2531-923X; Nair, Govind/0000-0003-3725-615X; Hu, Xiaoping/0000-0001-7014-5983; Howell, Brittany/0000-0002-5643-2326";"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health) [MH079100, P50 MH078105, MH078105-S1, MH091645, F31 MH086203, F31 MH085445]; National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [HD055255]; National Center for Research Resources [P51RR165-YNPRC]; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD [OD P51OD11132]";"National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Child Health & Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Center for Research Resources(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD";"This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health: grant numbers MH079100, P50 MH078105, and MH078105-S1, MH091645, and F31 MH086203 to B.R.H., F31 MH085445 to V.M.; National Institute of Child Health & Human Development: HD055255) and the National Center for Research Resources (grant number P51RR165-YNPRC base grant-currently supported by the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD-grant number OD P51OD11132).

Thirty deposits of distinguishable retrograde tracers were placed at restricted sites spanning the medial frontal lobe in 16 cats. Following each deposit, the number of retrogradely labeled neurons in each of 17 thalamic nuclei was determined. Variations of the thalamic labeling pattern dependent on the location of the cortical tracer deposit were then analyzed by a quantitative procedure. The results indicate that the medial frontal lobe contains three fundamental divisions: the anterior cingulate area, medial area 6, and the medial prefrontal district. The anterior cingulate area derives its strongest thalamic input from the anteromedial nucleus. Medial area 6 is the target of afferents originating in a dorsolateral sector of the mediodorsal nucleus and in the ventroanterior nucleus. Medial prefrontal cortex is heavily innervated by pathways originating in the core of the mediodorsal nucleus and in the principal ventromedial nucleus. Within each major district, thalamic connectional patterns exhibit graded regional variation, with the result that, whereas the connections of the district are not uniform, it is difficult to define further discrete subdivisions. We discuss these results in relation to previously proposed schemes for parcellation of the cat's medial frontal lobe and conclude that the infralimbic and prelimbic areas (areas 25 and 32) of previous systems are best understood not as discrete areas but as ventral and intermediate sectors of a continuous medial prefrontal domain.;GEORGE MASON UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,FAIRFAX,VA 22030;George Mason University;MUSIL, SY (corresponding author), NIH,SENSORIMOTOR RES LAB,BLDG 10,RM 10C101,BETHESDA,MD 20892, USA.;;;;NINDS NIH HHS [R01 NS27287-03] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;55;16;16;0;0;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

These include nociception, feeding, cognition, locomotion, stress and neuroendocrine control. The endogenous receptor for this ligand is the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor. The distribution of NOP in rodent has been widely reported by the use of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and autoradiographic radioligand binding but less is known of its localization in higher species. We have therefore sought to optimize and determine the distribution of I-125[Tyr(14)]N/OFQ binding sites in macaque primate brain and spinal cord. Highest levels of binding were observed in neocortical areas, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus and putamen, medial thalamic nuclei and superficial laminae of the superior colliculus. These novel data present for the first time, the distribution of N/OFQ receptors in non-human primate CNS and, by comparison with localization in the rat, reveal that species differences may exist in the distribution of this neuropeptide receptor. These data have important implications regarding the roles of N/OFQ across species and may have ramifications in the interpretation of preclinical pharmacological studies. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Cell bodies were described from Nissl material. Golgi-impregnated dendritic arborizations were reconstructed from serial sections and digitized in three dimensions by computer-assisted microscopy. The central complex was subdivided into three parts on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and hodological criteria: pars parafascicularis (medial), pars media (intermediate), and pars paralateralis (lateral). The mean cross-sectional areas of cell bodies were identical (181 mum2) in the three parts in macaques. In humans they were larger in the pars parafascicularis (304 mum2) than in the other parts (248 and 240 mum2). Small local circuit neurons were found throughout the complex. Large projection neurons differed statistically in the three parts. In macaques, pars parafascicularis neurons had few dendritic stems and tips (3-11) and a short total dendritic length (2,000 mum). Pars paralateralis neurons had more ramified (5-60) and longer (5,800 mum) dendrites. They bore numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons had intermediate characteristics (5-9; 2,400 mum). In humans, pars parafascicular neurons had similar topological characteristics (3-12) but longer dendrites (3,000 mum) than in the monkey. Pars paralateralis neurons had more branched (6-71) and longer (9,000 mum) dendrites, with more numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons also had intermediate characteristics (4-25; 3,800 mum).

In this study, we characterized the signals conveyed through an ascending pathway coursing from the superior colliculus (SC) to the frontal eye field (FEF) via mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Using antidromic and orthodromic stimulation, we identified SC source neurons, MD relay neurons, and FEF recipient neurons of the pathway in Macaca mulatta. The monkeys performed oculomotor tasks, including delayed-saccade tasks, that permitted analysis of signals such as visual activity, delay activity, and presaccadic activity. We found that the SC sends all of these signals into the pathway with no output selectivity, i.e., the signals leaving the SC resembled those found generally within the SC. Visual activity arrived in FEF too late to contribute to short-latency visual responses there, and delay activity was largely filtered out in MD. Presaccadic activity, however, seemed critical because it traveled essentially unchanged from SC to FEF. Signal transmission in the pathway was fast (similar to2 ms from SC to FEF) and topographically organized (SC neurons drove MD and FEF neurons having similarly eccentric visual and movement fields). Our analysis of identified neurons in one pathway from brain stem to frontal cortex thus demonstrates that multiple signals are sent from SC to FEF with presaccadic activity being prominent. We hypothesize that a major signal conveyed by the pathway is corollary discharge information about the vector of impending saccades.;NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Sommer, MA (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 2A50,MSC 4435,9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;mas@lsr.nei.nih.gov;;Sommer, Marc/0000-0001-5061-763X;;;;;105;236;240;0;12;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The functions of this top-down modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.;"[Diaz, Begona] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Diaz, Begona; Blank, Helen; von Kriegstein, Katharina] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Diaz, Begona] Univ Int Catalunya, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Basic Sci, Sant Cugat Del Valles 08195, Spain; [Blank, Helen] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [von Kriegstein, Katharina] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Psychol, D-01187 Dresden, Germany";"Pompeu Fabra University; University of Barcelona; Max Planck Society; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Technische Universitat Dresden";Diaz, B (corresponding author), Pompeu Fabra Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;begona.diaz@upf.edu;"von Kriegstein, Katharina/C-3135-2008; Blank, Helen/GQZ-7699-2022; Díaz, Begona/H-5854-2012";"von Kriegstein, Katharina/0000-0001-7989-5860; Blank, Helen/0000-0002-5824-0811; Díaz, Begona/0000-0003-1628-4901";"Max Planck Research Group Grant; ERC-Consolidator Grant (SENSOCOM) [647051]; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, REA grant) [32867]; Juan de la Cierva fellowship [JCI-2012-12678]";"Max Planck Research Group Grant; ERC-Consolidator Grant (SENSOCOM); People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, REA grant); Juan de la Cierva fellowship";We would like to thank S.

The motor circuits within the striato-pallidal complex are thought to facilitate desired movement and inhibit unwanted movement through their influence via thalamus, mainly on precentral motor cortical regions. Lesions in the motor thalamus, or in the globus pallidus, therefore might be expected to impair voluntary movement. But stereotaxic lesions in patients with Parkinson's disease directed at the motor thalamus verified at autopsy, and lesions in the globus pallidus, which improve rigidity and tremor apparently do not worsen parkinsonian hypokinesia and bradykinesia; nor do they regularly cause dyskinesias. Reasons for this discrepancy are reviewed. It is concluded that the motor circuits of the basal ganglia are part of a distributed motor system which can operate, albeit imperfectly, in the absence of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical feedback. There may, however be subtle defects in motor performance after thalamic and pallidal lesions which have escaped attention. Further consideration leads to two hypotheses concerning normal basal ganglia motor function. First it seems most likely that it is a pause in firing of medial pallidal and substantia nigra reticulata neurons that by disinhibition of thalamic targets, permits movements generated by cortical motor areas. An increase in firing of medial pallidal neurons, which so far has been the major focus of attention, may be more concerned with inhibition of unwanted movement. Secondly, we suggest that the basal ganglia play a particular role in motor control. A change in firing of medial pallidal neurons appears to occur too late to initiate a new movement. However the motor circuit within the striato-pallidal system routinely receives a continuous delayed read-out of cortical motor activity and issues an output directed via thalamus mainly to premotor cortical regions. This may permit the routine automatic execution of sequences of movements generated in cortical motor areas. There is evidence that other regions of the striatum respond to significant external or internal cues as dictated by their cortical inputs, the significance being determined by memory, novelty, emotional and other contexts. We suggest that such events capture the attention of the non-motor striatum, which then interrupts the routine operation of the motor circuit, perhaps at the level of the medial pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata, to permit new cortical motor action.";UNIV NAVARRA CLIN, DEPT NEUROL, PAMPLONA, SPAIN;University of Navarra;MARSDEN, CD (corresponding author), UNIV LONDON, NATL HOSP NEUROL & NEUROSURG, INST NEUROL, DEPT CLIN NEUROL, QUEEN SQ, LONDON WC1N 3BG, ENGLAND.;;;;;;;;144;549;556;0;30;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0006-8950;1460-2156;;BRAIN;Brain;AUG;1994;117;;4;;;;877;897;;10.1093/brain/117.4.877;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/117.4.877;;;21;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;PQ948;7922472;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994PQ94800020;View Full Record in Web of Science

Retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected in different loci of the parietal cortex. Injected areas were verified cytoarchitectonically and confirmed by analyzing the retrograde thalamic labeling pattern obtained. Anterograde fluorescent tracers were placed in the intermediate and lateral deep cerebellar nuclei. The topographical overlap between cerebellar terminals and parietal-projecting thalamic neurons was analyzed. In the central lateral (CL) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei, cells projecting to anterior somatosensory (S1) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortices were demonstrated to receive direct cerebellar input. In particular, two patterns of organization were revealed. In CL, the PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, both receiving cerebellar fibers, were intermingled. In VL, PPC, and S1-projecting neurons were instead segregated, and the areas containing labeled neurons received separate contingents of cerebellar fibers. These patterns suggest that in CL axons originating from the same or neighboring cerebellar neurons can terminate on both PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, while in VL cerebellar information is funneled to S1 and PPC through two segregated parallel pathways. The significance of the observed organization is discussed comparing findings in other species and in relation with electrophysiological and functional studies on cerebelloparietal interrelationships.

The traditional ventroposterior medial (VPM) and ventroposterior lateral (VPL) subnuclei were easily identified, as well as the forelimb and hindlimb compartments of VPL, as they were separated by poorly staining, cell-poor septa. Septa also separated other cell groups within VPM and VPL, specifically in the medial compartment of VPL representing the hand (hand VPL). In one squirrel monkey and one galago we demonstrated that these five groups of cells represent digits 1-5 in a mediolateral sequence by injecting tracers into the cortical representation of single digits, defined by microelectrode recordings, and relating concentrations of labeled neurons to specific cell groups in hand VPL. The results establish the existence of septa that isolate the representation of the five digits in VPL of primates and demonstrate that the isolated cell groups represent digits 1-5 in a mediolateral sequence. The present results show that the septa are especially prominent in brain sections processed for vGluT2, which is expressed in the synaptic terminals of excitatory neurons in most nuclei of the brainstem and thalamus. As vGluT2 is expressed in the synaptic terminations from dorsal columns and trigeminal brainstem nuclei, the effectiveness of vGluT2 preparations in revealing septa in VP likely reflects a lack of synapses using glutamate in the septa.

This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described.

Lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at cervical levels in monkeys result in expansion of the intact chin inputs into the deafferented hand representation in area 3b, second somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas of the somatosensory cortex, ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus, and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. Here, we describe the extent and nature of reorganization of the cuneate and gracile nuclei of adult macaque monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns, and compare it with the reorganization of area 3b in the same monkeys. In both, area 3b and the cuneate nucleus chin inputs expand to reactivate the deafferented neurons. However, unlike area 3b, neurons in the cuneate nucleus also acquire receptive fields on the shoulder, neck, and occiput. A comparison with the previously published results shows that reorganization in the cuneate nucleus is similar to that in VPL. Thus, the emergent topography following deafferentations by spinal cord injuries undergoes transformation as the reorganized inputs ascend from subcortical nuclei to area 3b. The results help us understand mechanisms of the brain plasticity following spinal cord injuries.;"[Halder, Priyabrata; Kambi, Niranjan; Chand, Prem; Jain, Neeraj] Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India";"Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Brain Research Centre (NBRC)";Jain, N (corresponding author), Natl Brain Res Ctr, NH 8, Manesar 122051, Haryana, India.;neeraj.jain@nbrc.ac.in;"Chand, Prem/K-7814-2012; Kambi, Niranjan/IUO-2552-2023; Jain, Neeraj/B-2882-2010";"Chand, Prem/0000-0002-8266-9781; Kambi, Niranjan/0009-0007-8436-490X; Jain, Neeraj/0000-0002-3672-5850";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/PR7180/MED/30/907/2012]; National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India [19-06/2011(i)EU-IV]; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [9/821(0034)/2011-EMR-1]";"Department of Biotechnology, Government of India(Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India); National Brain Research Centre; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Council for Scientific and Industrial Research(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)";Department of Biotechnology, Government of India to N.J.

Several brain imaging studies among patients with CPSP demonstrate that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this condition is the maladaptive plasticity of pain-related brain regions. However, the temporal profile of the regional plastic changes, as suggested by brain imaging of CPSP patients, as well as their cellular basis, is unknown. To investigate these issues, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical analysis with our established CPSP monkey model. From 8 weeks after a hemorrhagic lesion to the unilateral ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the monkeys exhibited significant behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting allodynia. The present VBM results revealed a decrease in gray matter volume in the pain-related areas after several weeks following the lesion. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining in the ipsilesional posterior insular cortex (ipsi-PIC) and secondary somatosensory cortex (ipsi-SII), where the significant reduction in gray matter volume was observed in the VBM result, displayed a significant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals compared to intact monkeys. Our results suggest that progressive changes in neuronal morphology, including synaptic loss in the ipsi-PIC/SII, are involved in the CPSP.;"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Bando, Daigo; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat & Interact Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Niigata 9503198, Japan; [Nemoto, Kiyotaka] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan; [Takashima, Ichiro; Bando, Daigo] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Niigata University; University of Tsukuba; University of Tsukuba";Higo, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat & Interact Res Inst, 1-1-1 Umezono, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan.;n.higo@aist.go.jp;"Nemoto, Kiyotaka/C-4987-2013; Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016";"Nemoto, Kiyotaka/0000-0001-8623-9829; Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316";"KAKENHI from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17 J03104, 20 K19389, 20H04061]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan [20H05490]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H05490, 20H04061] Funding Source: KAKEN";"KAKENHI from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This work was supported by KAKENHI (Nos. 17 J03104 and 20 K19389 to K.N. and No. 20H04061 to N.H.) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Hyper-adaptability for overcoming body-brain dysfunction: Integrated empirical and system theoretical approaches (No. 20H05490 to N.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan.;;45;4;4;2;11;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Area GrFO displays strong connections with areas DO, PrCO, and ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPF) area 12l, and even more with the mostly hand-related ventral premotor (PMv) area F5a. Other connections involve the mostly face/mouth-related PMv area F5c, the arm-related area F6/pre-SMA, the hand-related fields of VLPF areas 46v and 12r, and area SII, mostly the hand representation. Furthermore, area GrFO shows rich connectivity with several components of the limbic system including orbitofrontal areas 12o, 12m, and 11, the agranular and dysgranular insula, the agranular cingulate area 24, and the amygdala. Thalamic afferents originate primarily from the parvocellular and the magnocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus and from midline and intralaminar nuclei. This connectivity pattern clearly distinguishes area GrFO from areas DO and PrCO, characterized by a connectivity mostly involving oral sensorimotor and gustatory areas/subcortical structures. The present data suggest, based on connectivity patterns, an involvement of area GrFO in the cortical circuits for controlling goal-directed hand and face/mouth actions. In this context, area GrFO could represent a gateway for the access of limbic inputs, for example about subjective values, emotional significance of stimuli or internal states, to the PMv areas involved in selecting appropriate goal-directed hand and mouth/face actions.;"[Gerbella, Marzio; Borra, Elena; Rozzi, Stefano; Luppino, Giuseppe] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Gerbella, Marzio] Ist Italiano Tecnol IIT, Brain Ctr Social & Motor Cognit, Parma, Italy";"University of Parma; Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT";Luppino, G (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dipartimento Neurosci, Sez Fisiol, Via Volturno 39, I-43100 Parma, Italy.;luppino@unipr.it;"Gerbella, Marzio/Q-1377-2016; Rozzi, Stefano/F-9915-2019";"Gerbella, Marzio/0000-0002-1204-3484; Rozzi, Stefano/0000-0002-6147-1530; Luppino, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0220-0618";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2010MEFNF7_005]; European Commission [FP7-250013]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) [P7/11]";"Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office)";The work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca (grant number: PRIN 2010, 2010MEFNF7_005), European Commission Grant Cogsystems FP7-250013, and Interuniversity Attraction Poles (IAP) P7/11.;;58;23;23;1;5;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1863-2653;1863-2661;;BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT;Brain Struct.

Under standardized conditions and polysomnographic control, the patients underwent repeated 24-hour study sessions covering the entire clinical course of the disease. Hormones were assayed at 30-min intervals. Four healthy volunteers were used as controls. A sleep/wake cycle was always absent in fatal familial insomnia. Serum somatotropin and prolactin concentrations never exceeded the normal range of variation. The nocturnal elevation of somatotropin disappeared simultaneously with sleep loss, whereas a significant 24-hour component of variations in serum prolactin levels was present for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle, with normally placed nocturnal acrophases. Complete obliteration of the 24-hour component was achieved for prolactin only in the advanced stages, through a progressive decrease in 24-hour amplitude of variation. Selective and progressive degeneration of the mediodorsal and anterior ventral nuclei of the thalamus causes an early obliteration of the 24-hour rhythm of somatotropin and a later disappearance of circadian prolactin rhythmicity. The persistence of a significant circadian rhythm for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle indicates that prolactin rhythmicity is not exclusively sleep-entrained.;"UNIV BOLOGNA,INST NEUROL,BOLOGNA,ITALY; UNIV BOLOGNA,S ORSOLA M MALPIGHI HOSP,CENT LAB,BOLOGNA,ITALY; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,INST PATHOL,DIV NEUROPATHOL,CLEVELAND,OH 44106";"University of Bologna; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; University of Bologna; Case Western Reserve University";PORTALUPPI, F (corresponding author), UNIV FERRARA,INST INTERNAL MED 1,DEPT INTERNAL MED,HYPERTENS UNIT,VIA SAVONAROLA 9,I-44100 FERRARA,ITALY.;;"Manfredini, Roberto/AAJ-5442-2020; Avoni, Patrizia/AAC-1879-2020; Manfredini, Roberto/N-3859-2019; Cortelli, Pietro/K-6063-2016; Manfredini, Roberto/A-3471-2008; Portaluppi, Francesco/H-2206-2012";"Manfredini, Roberto/0000-0002-8364-2601; Manfredini, Roberto/0000-0002-8364-2601; Portaluppi, Francesco/0000-0002-2948-1579; AVONI, PATRIZIA/0000-0003-0719-6803; Cortelli, Pietro/0000-0002-3633-8818";;;;;36;23;25;0;1;KARGER;BASEL;ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;0028-3835;;;NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY;Neuroendocrinology;JUN;1995;61;6;;;;;731;737;;10.1159/000126901;http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000126901;;;7;"Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences & Neurology";RE340;7659197;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1995RE34000015;View Full Record in Web of Science

To study this role, a clearer understanding of pregeniculate organization is required. Based on its connectivity and neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that this nucleus is composed of several subnuclei, suggesting the term, pregeniculate complex (PrGC). The PrGC includes a weakly developed dorsal lamina, rostrally, and a well-developed ventral lamina. The ventral lamina includes the retinorecipient and superior sublayers, rostrally, and the medial division, caudally. A thin lamina of cells lateral to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is contiguous with the PrGC; we term this the lateral division. The PrGC and the lateral division each project to the SC/NOT; the superior sublayer and medial division of the PrGC are connected reciprocally to the SC/NOT. Immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and substance P (SP) further delineate the PrGC subnuclei. The retinorecipient sublayer stains most intensely for GABA and SP. The superior sublayer and medial division also stain strongly for GABA and SP. Essentially all neurons in the lateral division are GABA-positive. The combination of tract tracing and immunocytochemistry demonstrate differences in the connectivity of the PrGC subnuclei and the lateral division with the SC/NOT. This, combined with the differential localization of GABA in the PrGC, provides a basis for further study of its functional role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sprouting of cortical axons cannot account for the extent of reorganization, and withdrawal of axons of deafferented brainstem and thalamic neurons, permitting expression of previously silent synapses, has not been directly demonstrated. This study is focused on the second of these. In monkeys, deafferented for two years by section of the cuneate fasciculus at the C1 level, there was extensive withdrawal of axon terminals from thalamus and cortex, detectable a decade before visible atrophy of their parent neuronal somata in the cuneate nucleus or thalamus. Slow, inexorable progression of lemniscal and thalamocortical axonal withdrawal is a neurodegenerative phenomenon likely to be a powerful inducement to compensatory long-term plasticity, a mechanism that can explain the long-term evolution of cortical reorganization and, with it, phantom sensations in spinal patients and amputees.;"[Graziano, Alessandro; Jones, Edward G.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis";Jones, EG (corresponding author), 1544 Newton Court, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health [NS 21377]; United States Public Health Service; University of California";"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Public Health Service(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service); University of California(University of California System)";This work was supported by Grant NS 21377 from the National Institutes of Health, United States Public Health Service, and by the University of California, Davis, W.

Donepezil, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AChEI), has been recommended as a treatment option for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to characterize the effects of donepezil on rCMRglu using FDG-PET in non-human primates. We investigated the effects of administration of donepezil (500 mu g/kg, i.m.), the non-selective muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist scopolamine (30 mu g/kg, i.m.), and the coadministration of both drugs on the rCMRglu of conscious young rhesus monkeys. Donepezil increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except in the thalamus. Scopolamine treatment also increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except the cerebellum and thalamus. However, these effects disappeared with coadministration of the drugs. This PET study showed that administration of donepezil or scopolamine alone increased the rCMRglu in conscious rhesus monkeys. We also found that the donepezil-induced increase was abolished by simultaneous administration of scopolamine, suggesting that muscarinic ACh receptor function plays an important role in the effect of donepezil.;"[Asai, Makoto; Matsuoka, Nobuya] Astellas Pharma Inc, Drug Discovery Res, Dept Neurosci, Pharmacol Res Labs, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058585, Japan; [Asai, Makoto; Fujikawa, Akihiko; Noda, Akihiro; Miyoshi, Sosuke; Nishimura, Shintaro] Med & Pharmacol Res Ctr Fdn, Hakui, Ishikawa 9250613, Japan; [Fujikawa, Akihiko; Noda, Akihiro; Miyoshi, Sosuke; Nishimura, Shintaro] Astellas Pharma Inc, Drug Discovery Res, Bioimaging Res Labs, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058585, Japan";"Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Astellas Pharmaceuticals";Asai, M (corresponding author), Astellas Pharma Inc, Drug Discovery Res, Dept Neurosci, Pharmacol Res Labs, 21 Miyukigaoka, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058585, Japan.;makoto.asai@jp.astellas.com;;Miyoshi, Sosuke/0000-0003-4025-2977;"prefectural government of Ishikawa, Japan; Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)";"prefectural government of Ishikawa, Japan; Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))";The authors appreciate the technical assistance with animal experiments provided by Taishiro Kimura, Jun Mizusawa, and Masafumi Yamamoto.

The present study addressed this question from the point of view of connectional properties by comparing the afferent and efferent projections of the caudal forelimb area (CFA), considered to be the equivalent of the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (MI), and a second forelimb motor representation, the rostral forelimb area (RFA). As a result of various tracing experiments (including double labeling), it was observed that CFA and RFA had reciprocal corticocortical connections characterized by preferential, asymmetrical, laminar distribution, indicating that RFA may occupy a different hierarchical level than CFA, according to criteria previously discussed in the visual cortex of primates. Furthermore, it was found that RFA, but not CFA, exhibited dense reciprocal connections with the insular cortex. With respect to their efferent projection to the basal ganglia, it was observed that CFA projected very densely to the lateral portion of the ipsilateral caudate putamen, whereas the contralateral projection was sparse and more restricted. The ipsilateral projection originating from RFA was slightly less dense than that from CFA, but it covered a larger portion of the caudate putamen (in the medial direction); the contralateral projection from RFA to the caudate putamen was of the same density and extent as the ipsilateral projection. The reciprocal thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of RFA and CFA differed from each other in the sense that CFA was mainly interconnected with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, while RFA was mainly connected with the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. Altogether, these connectional differences, compared with the pattern of organization of the motor cortical areas in primates, suggest that RFA in the rat may well be an equivalent of the premotor or supplementary motor area. In contrast to the corticocortical, corticostriatal, and thalamocortical connections, RFA and CFA showed similar efferent projections to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, tectum, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, and spinal cord.";;;ROUILLER, EM (corresponding author), UNIV FRIBOURG,INST PHYSIOL,RUE MUSEE 5,CH-1700 FRIBOURG,SWITZERLAND.;;Liang, Fengyi/A-7521-2018;"Liang, Fengyi/0000-0003-1162-6212; Rouiller, Eric/0000-0003-1355-6019";;;;;66;141;141;0;11;CARFAX PUBL CO;ABINGDON;PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

Hitherto, experimental studies have suggested that STN-HFS reduces the activity of STN neurons. However, some recent reports have challenged this view, showing that STN-HFS might also increase the activity of globus pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons that are under strong excitatory drive of the STN. In addition, most results emanate from studies applying acute STN-HFS, while parkinsonian patients receive chronic stimulation. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the effect of chronic (10 days) STN-HFS in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated nonhuman primate. For this purpose, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, a measure of global synaptic activity, was assessed in the basal ganglia and the motor thalamus after chronic unilateral STN-HFS. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mRNA expression, a marker of efferent metabolic activity, was additionally assessed in the globus pallidus. Chronic STN-HFS (i) reversed abnormally decreased 2-DG uptake in the STN of parkinsonian nonhuman primates, (ii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG accumulation in the GPi while COI mRNA expression was increased, suggesting global activation of GPi neurons, and (iii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG uptake in the ventrolateral motor thalamus nucleus. The simultaneous decrease in 2-DG uptake and increase in COI mRNA expression are difficult to reconcile with the current model of basal ganglia function and suggest that the mechanisms by which STN-HFS exerts its clinical benefits are more complex than a simple reversal of abnormal activity in the STN and its targets.;"Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS UMR 5227, F-33076 Bordeaux, France; CHU Pellegrin, Dept Neurol, Bordeaux, France";"UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; CHU Bordeaux";Meissner, W (corresponding author), Univ Victor Segalen, CNRS UMR 5543, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, F-33076 Bordeaux, France.;wassilios.meissner@umr5543.u-bordeaux2.fr;"Bezard, Erwan/A-8173-2008; Benazzouz, Abdelhamid/E-5050-2016; Bezard, Erwan/ABD-5153-2021; Meissner, Wassilios/C-7817-2015";"Bezard, Erwan/0000-0002-0410-4638; Meissner, Wassilios/0000-0003-2172-7527; Benazzouz, Abdelhamid/0000-0002-2282-1120";;;;;80;24;25;0;5;BLACKWELL PUBLISHING;OXFORD;9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND;0953-816X;;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

Such changes were further examined by studying immunoreactivity for calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin, three calcium-binding proteins that mark distinct subpopulations of GABA neurons, in macaques that had been monocularly deprived by intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin. Deprivation for 5 d dr longer produced a reversal in the normal pattern of calbindin immunostaining in layer III, from one In which intense neuronal immunostaining surrounded the cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs to one in which it occupied the puffs; Over the same period, calbindin immunostaining in other layers was reduced across the entire width of deprived-eye columns or extended into flanking regions of normal-eye columns. In contrast, reduction in parvalbumin immunostaining occurred only in deprived-eye columns and included only terminals with short periods of deprivation (up to 17 d) bet both terminals and somata with longer periods. No change in calretinin immunoreactivity was observed. These findings demonstrate that GABA neurons of macaque V1 vary in their response to monocular deprivation according to their neurochemistry and position, suggesting that the weight of inputs from the two eyes and the intrinsic characteristics of each GABA population determine how a neuron responds to a change in visual input.";"JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, DEPT NEUROSCI, BALTIMORE, MD 21218 USA; UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES, DEPT PSYCHOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 USA";"Johns Hopkins University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles";Carder, RK (corresponding author), JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, ZANVYL KRIEGER MIND BRAIN INST, 338 KRIEGER HALL, 3400 N CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218 USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY 06432, EY 06344] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;101;52;52;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

With each saccade, the image jumps on the retina, causing a discontinuity in visual input. Our visual perception, however, remains stable. Philosophers and scientists over centuries have proposed that visual stability depends upon an internal neuronal signal that is a copy of the neuronal signal driving the eye movement, now referred to as a corollary discharge (CD) or efference copy. In the old world monkey, such a CD circuit for saccades has been identified extending from superior colliculus through MD thalamus to frontal cortex, but there is little evidence that this circuit actually contributes to visual perception. We tested the influence of this CD circuit on visual perception by first training macaque monkeys to report their perceived eye direction, and then reversibly inactivating the CD as it passes through the thalamus. We found that the monkey's perception changed; during CD inactivation, there was a difference between where the monkey perceived its eyes to be directed and where they were actually directed. Perception and saccade were decoupled. We established that the perceived eye direction at the end of the saccade was not derived from proprioceptive input from eye muscles, and was not altered by contextual visual information. We conclude that the CD provides internal information contributing to the brain's creation of perceived visual stability. More specifically, the CD might provide the internal saccade vector used to unite separate retinal images into a stable visual scene.";"[Cavanaugh, James; Berman, Rebecca A.; Joiner, Wilsaan M.; Wurtz, Robert H.] NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI)";Cavanaugh, J (corresponding author), NEI, Sensorimotor Res Lab, Bldg 49,Room 2A50, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;jrc@lsr.nei.nih.gov;;;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health;National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));This work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health.

Quantitative analysis showed that 1) whereas the projection from TE to the superior colliculus is consistent (5 of 5 cases) and widespread in infants, it is less reliable (2 of 7 cases) and limited in areal extent in adults; 2) although the projections from TE to nucleus medialis dorsalis and the tail of the caudate are present in infants and adults, they are reduced in adults; and 3) TEO receives input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in both infants and adults, but the number of cells giving rise to this projection is lower in adults. There was also a suggestion that TE projects to nucleus paracentralis in infants (2 of 5 cases) but not in adults (0 of 7 cases). No differences between infants and adults were apparent in other subcortical connections, including those with the pulvinar, reticular nucleus, claustrum, and putamen.

The neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. We postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), or serotonin (SERT) transporter activities. In vivo, we determined DAT and NET occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the DAT, NET, SERT, and rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (TA1). In rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal DAT was detected by [C-11]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-4-(fluorophenyl) tropane and of thalamic NET by [C-11](S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl) morpholine. In vitro, modafinil effects in DAT-human embryonic kidney (HEK), NET-HEK, and SERT-HEK cells were investigated alone or combined with the TA1 receptor. Modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal DAT sites (5 mg/kg: 35 +/- 12%, n = 4; 8 mg/kg: 54 +/- 3%, n = 3). In thalamus, modafinil occupied NET sites (5 mg/kg: 16 +/- 7.8%, n = 6; 8 mg/ kg: 44 +/- 12%; n = 2). In vitro, modafinil inhibited [H-3] dopamine (IC50 = 6.4 mu M), [H-3] norepinephrine (IC50 = 35.6 mu M), and [H-3] serotonin (IC50 > 500 mu M) transport via the human DAT, NET, and SERT. Modafinil did not activate the TA1 receptor in TA1-HEK cells, but it augmented a monoamine transporter-dependent enhancement of phenethylamine activation of TA1 in TA1-DAT and TA1-NET cells, but not in TA1-SERT cells. The present data provide compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the DAT and NET in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.";"Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New England Primate Res Ctr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA";"Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital";Madras, BK (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New England Primate Res Ctr, 1 Pine Hill Dr, Southborough, MA 01772 USA.;bertha_madras@hms.harvard.edu;Lin, Zhicheng/B-9756-2008;"Lin, Zhicheng/0000-0002-6864-6559; Chen, Jiahui/0000-0001-9186-1110";"NCRR NIH HHS [P51 RR000168, RR00168] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHS [DA06303, DA15305, DA11558, R01 DA011558, DA16606, K05 DA015305, R01 DA006303] Funding Source: Medline; NIH HHS [P51 OD011103] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";;;56;255;259;0;14;AMER SOC PHARMACOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3995 USA;0022-3565;1521-0103;;J PHARMACOL EXP THER;J.

This study provides a detailed description of the visual physiology of corticogeniculate neurons in the primate. Using electrical stimulation to identify corticogeniculate neurons, we distinguish three groups of neurons with response properties that closely resemble those of neurons in the magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers of their target structure, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Our results indicate that corticogeniculate feedback in the primate is stream specific, and provide strong evidence in support of the view that corticothalamic feedback can influence the transmission of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex in a stream-selective manner.;"[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

Rapid adaptation in behavior has been attributed to frontal cortical circuits, but it is not clear if sensory cortexes also play an essential role in such tasks. In this study we tested whether the auditory cortex was necessary for rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds. We used a two-alternative choice sound-categorization task for rats in which the boundary that separated two acoustic categories changed several times within a behavioral session. These shifts in the boundary resulted in changes in the rewarded action for a subset of stimuli. We found that extensive lesions of the auditory cortex did not impair the ability of rats to switch between categorization contingencies and sound discrimination performance was minimally impaired. Similar results were obtained after reversible inactivation of the auditory cortex with muscimol. In contrast, lesions of the auditory thalamus largely impaired discrimination performance and, as a result, the ability to modify behavior across contingencies. Thalamic lesions did not impair performance of a visual discrimination task, indicating that the effects were specific to audition and not to motor preparation or execution. These results suggest that subcortical outputs of the auditory thalamus can mediate rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds.;"[Gimenez, Tyler L.; Jaramillo, Santiago] Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Gimenez, Tyler L.; Jaramillo, Santiago] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lorenc, Maja] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA";"University of Oregon; University of Oregon; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory";Jaramillo, S (corresponding author), 1254 Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;sjara@uoregon.edu;;"Jaramillo, Santiago/0000-0002-6595-8450; Lorenc, Maja/0000-0003-2665-0135";"Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon; Medical Research Foundation";"Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon; Medical Research Foundation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))";This work was supported by the Office for Research and Innovation at the University of Oregon and a grant from the Medical Research Foundation.;;51;21;21;1;11;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

Although many of the connections linked neighboring areas, others selectively connected relatively distant areas. Most, but not all, of the connections were reciprocal. Altogether, the connections formed at least two distinct networks within the OMPFC. The ''orbital'' prefrontal network linked most of the areas within the orbital cortex, with very few connections to medial prefrontal areas. Areas Iam, Iapm, Ial, 121, 12m, and 12r in the caudal and lateral parts of the orbital cortex (which received inputs from several sensory modalities) had convergent connections with areas 131, 13m, and 13b in the central orbital cortex, with further connections to the rostral orbital area 11l. For the connections between areas Iapm, Iam, Ial, 13m, 131, and 11l, rostrally directed fibers arose mainly in layer V, whereas caudally directed fibers originated mainly in layer III. The ''medial'' prefrontal network selectively involved medial areas 14r, 14c, 24, 25, 32, and 10m, rostral orbital areas 10o and 11m, and agranular insular area Iai in the posterior orbital cortex. Two orbital areas, 13a and 12o, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections. The two networks also had distinct connections with other cortical regions, with limbic structures, and with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Their role in guidance of affective behavior is discussed.

In this study the architectonic structure of the OMPFC was analyzed with nine histochemical and immunohistochemical stains in 32 individuals of three macaque species. The stains included Nissl, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, Timm, and selenide stains and immunohistochemical stains for parvalbumin, calbindin, a nonphosphorylated neurofilament epitope (with the SMI-32 antibody), and a membrane-bound glycoprotein (with the 8b3 antibody). In addition to patterns of cell bodies and myelinated fibers, these techniques allow the visualization of markers related to metabolism, synapses, and neurotransmitters. A cortical area was defined as distinct if it was differentiated in at least three different stains and, as described in later papers, possessed a distinct set of connections. Twenty-two areas were recognized in the OMPFC. Walker's areas 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 [J. Comp. Neurol. (1940) 73:59-86] have been subdivided into areas 10m, 10o, 11m, 11l, 12r, 12l, 12m, 12o, 13m, 13l, 13a, 13b, 14r, and 14c. On the medial wall, areas 32, 25, and 24a,b,c have been delineated, in addition to area 10m. The agranular insula also has been recognized to extend onto the posterior orbital surface and has been subdivided into medial, intermediate, lateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral agranular insula areas. The OMPFC, therefore, resembles other areas of primate cortex, such as the posterior parietal and temporal cortices, where a large number of relatively small, structurally and connectionally distinct areas have been recognized. Just as the area-specific neurophysiological properties of these parietotemporal areas underlie broader regional functions such as visuospatial analysis, it is likely that the many small areas of the OMPFC also make differential contributions to the general mnemonic, sensory, and affective functions of this region.

Areas V1, V2, and VS/MT are conserved across mammals and are central for visual behavior. To facilitate the generation of biologically accurate computational models of primate early visual processing, here we provide an overview of over 350 published studies of these three areas in the genus Macaca, whose visual system provides the closest model for human vision. The literature reports 14 anatomical connection types from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to V1 having distinct layers of origin or termination, and 194 connection types between V1, V2, and VS, forming multiple parallel and interacting visual processing streams. Moreover, within V1, there are reports of 286 and 120 types of intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively. Physiologically, tuning of neuronal responses to 11 types of visual stimulus parameters has been consistently reported. Overall, the optimal spatial frequency (SF) of constituent neurons decreases with cortical hierarchy. Moreover, VS neurons are distinct from neurons in other areas for their higher direction selectivity, higher contrast sensitivity, higher temporal frequency tuning, and wider SF bandwidth.

Previous studies have demonstrated marked differences in the relative sizes of ON and OFF responses of neurons in the whisker/barrel system. In particular, OFF responses are unexpectedly large in thalamic neurons. Extracellular unit recordings were used to examine whether varying the time between stimulus onset and offset differently affects OFF responses of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, ventrobasal thalamus, and somatosensory cortical layer IV. Controlled whisker stimuli were used to deflect individual vibrissal hairs in different directions. We hypothesized that, in part because of the gradual waning of central inhibition evoked by stimulus onset, OFF responses of thalamic and cortical neurons but not trigeminal ganglion cells would increase in size with longer duration stimuli, with relative changes being greatest in the cortex. 2. OFF response magnitudes for thalamic and cortical neuronal populations increased as the stimulus duration was increased from 200 to 1,400 ms. Increases were greater at nonoptimal deflection angles. Similarly, individual cells having smaller OFF responses for the short-duration stimulus tended to display proportionately greater increases when the stimulus was lengthened. OFF responses of trigeminal ganglion cells were largely unaffected by stimulus duration. 3. Barrel neurons were subclassified as regular-spike units (RSUs) or fast-spike units (FSUs) on the basis of the time course of their action potentials. ON and OFF responses were smaller in the former and, when the stimulus was lengthened, percentage increases in their OFF responses were greater than those in FSUs. Results illustrate nonlinear transformations of the thalamic input signal by RSUs, which are presumed to be excitatory barrel neurons, and extend previous findings of response similarities between thalamocortical units (TCUs) and FSUs, the latter of which are thought to be inhibitory.ate hyperpolarization. In behaving animals, thalamic inhibition and the LTS mechanism could counterbalance each other to maintain TCUs within an optimal range of responsiveness.;UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PHYS THERAPY,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261;"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";KYRIAZI, HT (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL,E1454 BIOMED SCI TOWER,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.;;Simons, Daniel J/A-8214-2011;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-19950] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;37;64;64;0;1;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

To understand the neural relationship of the PMC with the rest of the brain, we injected its component areas with four different anterograde and retrograde tracers in the cynomolgus monkey and found that all PMC areas are interconnected with each other and with the anterior cingulate, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal, the lateral parietal cortices, and area TPO, as well as the thalamus, where projections from some of the PMC areas traverse in an uninterrupted bar-like manner, the dorsum of this structure from the posteriormost nuclei to its rostralmost tip. All PMC regions also receive projections from the claustrum and the basal forebrain and project to the caudate, the basis pontis, and the zona incerta. Moreover, the posterior cingulate areas are interconnected with the parahippocampal regions, whereas the medial parietal cortex projects only sparsely to the presubiculum. Although local interconnections and shared remote connections of all PMC components suggest a functional relationship among them, the distinct connections of each area with different neural structures suggests that distinct functional modules may be operating within the PMC. Our study provides a large-scale map of the PMC connections with the rest of the brain, which may serve as a useful tool for future studies of this cortical region and may contribute to elucidating its intriguing pattern of activity seen in recent functional imaging studies.;"Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ So Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA";"University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Southern California";Parvizi, J (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Neurol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;jparvizi@bidmc.harvard.edu;Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019;Buckwalter, Joseph/0000-0001-9758-7255;NINDS NIH HHS [P01 NS019632, R01 NS014944, P01 NS 19632, NS 14944] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;34;235;236;0;10;NATL ACAD SCIENCES;WASHINGTON;2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA;0027-8424;;;P NATL ACAD SCI USA;Proc.

The results indicate that corticothalamic connections of the STS in general reciprocate thalamocortical connections. The cortex of the upper bank of the STS-multimodal areas TPO and PGa-projects to four major thalamic targets: the pulvinar complex, the mediodorsal nucleus, the limitans-suprageniculate nucleus, as well as intralaminar nuclei. Within the pulvinar complex, the main projections of the upper bank of the STS are directed to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Rostral upper bank regions tend to project caudally and medially within the PM nucleus, caudal upper bank regions, more laterally and ventrally. The mid-portion of the upper bank tends to occupy the central sector of the PM nucleus. There are also relatively minor projections from upper bank regions to the lateral pulvinar (PL) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei. In contrast to the upper bank, the projections from the lower bank are directed primarily to the pulvinar complex, with only minor projections to intralaminar nuclei. The rostral portion of the lower bank projects mainly to caudal and medial regions of the PM nucleus, whereas the caudal lower bank projects predominantly to the lateral PM nucleus, and also to the PL, PO, and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei. The mid-portion of the lower bank projects mainly to central and lateral portions of the PM nucleus, and also to the PI and PL nuclei. The rostral depth of the STS projects mainly to the PM nucleus, with only minor connections to the PO, PI, and PL nuclei. The mid-portion of multimodal area TPO of the upper bank, areas TPO2 and TPO3, projects preferentially to the central sector of the PM nucleus.

In two animals, after denervation by amputation, it was found that electrode positions that initially recorded neurons with Rds on the amputated digit had new Rds extending from the wound. Often the new fields were on adjacent digits. Neurons with initial Rds that were partially amputated, or in some cases close to but not on the amputated digit, showed considerable expansion of the remaining RF. In three monkeys local anesthesia was used to provide a temporary denervation. In these experiments electrodes were placed in equivalent positions in both cortices. The effect on cortex contralateral to the denervation was similar to that seen with amputation. However, after esthesia returned to the digit, the expanded Rds contracted. In cortex ipsilateral to the denervation, Rds were on the opposite unaffected hand. These also rapidly expanded and then contracted, with the same time course as their counterparts in cortex contralateral to the denervation. Because of the rapidity of the expansion and its temporary nature with short-term denervation, the basis of the effect is probably an unmasking of existing but normally unexpressed connections, which are normally inhibited by the intact output from the denervated area. The wide arborization fields of thalamocortical afferents provide a potential source for the unmasked sensitivity. A mechanism for the inhibition that normally suppresses the expression of large Rds is not readily apparent. However, work in other species suggests that peripheral C fibers provide the primary source of input to central inhibitory circuits.;UNIV QUEENSLAND,DEPT PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,BRISBANE,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA;University of Queensland;CALFORD, MB (corresponding author), UNIV QUEENSLAND,VIS TOUCH & HEARING RES CTR,BRISBANE,QLD 4072,AUSTRALIA.;;Calford, Mike B/B-4637-2009;Calford, Mike B/0000-0002-5727-0234;;;;;44;140;140;1;4;GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC;NEW YORK;72 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012;0899-0220;;;SOMATOSENS MOT RES;Somatosens.

After intracortical microstimulation mapping of the forelimb area in the primary motor cortex of four macaque monkeys, a retrograde tracing study with fluorescent dyes was attempted to label simultaneously neurons in cortical and subcortical sites projecting to the distal forelimb representation area and those projecting to the proximal representation area of the primary motor cortex. Neurons projecting to distal and proximal forelimb parts of the primary motor cortex were largely separate in the following areas: the premotor area, primary somatosensory area, secondary somatosensory area, area 5, and thalamus. In contrast, there was no precise topographic organization of labeled projection neurons in the following areas: the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, primary motor cortex adjacent to the injection sites, claustrum, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The present study revealed that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives both segregated and intermixed inputs from cortical and subcortical sources. In particular, the fact that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives topographically organized inputs from the premotor area and nontopographically organized inputs from the supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area indicates possible different functional roles of frontal premotor areas in control of coordinated distal and proximal forelimb movements.;"NATL INST PHYSIOL SCI,OKAZAKI,AICHI 444,JAPAN; TOHOKU UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PHYSIOL,AOBA KU,SENDAI,MIYAGI 980,JAPAN";"National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Tohoku University";;;;;;;;;39;154;155;0;3;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

This morphological study of riMLF neurons in the rhesus monkey was undertaken to further our understanding of the functional circuitry of the oculomotor system. Our study employed Nissl, Golgi, and computer-assisted methods. The cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the riMLF and its relationships to neighboring structures were determined in both Nissl and Golgi preparations. Five (I-V) distinct morphological types of riMLF neurons were distinguished in the Golgi impregnations on the basis of soma size, dendritic size, numbers of primary dendrites, number of dendritic branch points, as well as form, number, and distribution of dendritic appendages. Type I neurons impregnated most frequently and had the most extensive and highly branched dendritic tree. Type II neurons displayed thick dendrites with complex dendritic appendages, but the dendritic tree was much more compact than that of type I cells. Type III and type V cells had fusiform somas and relatively unbranched dendritic trees but differed greatly in size as well as dendritic morphology. The type IV cell was the smallest neuron and had many characteristics of the local interneurons found in other thalamic, subthalamic, hypothalamic, and midbrain centers. The type V was the largest neuron, least frequently impregnated, and found only at rostral riMLF levels. Digitized reconstructions of each type of neuron were rotated by the computer, which revealed that the dendritic trees of types I, III, and V occupy a disk-like compartment in the riMLF neuropil. In contrast, the trees of types II and IV occupy a roughly spherical compartment. We suggest that three of the cell types are well suited for specific purposes: type II cells for receiving topographically organized inputs that contain spatial information, type I cells for short-lead burst neuron output to the motor neurons or other premotor centers, and type TV cells for inhibitory inputs to type I cells.

An NPY Y1 PET tracer is useful for determining the level of target engagement by NPY Y1 antagonists in preclinical and clinical studies. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of [F-18]Y1-973, a novel PET tracer for NPY Vi. [F-18]Y1-973 was radiolabeled by reaction of a primary chloride with [F-18]KF/K2.2.2 followed by deprotection with HCl. [F-18]Y1-973 was produced with high radiochemical purity (>98%) and high specific activity (>1000 Ci/mmol). PET studies in rhesus monkey brain showed that the distribution of [F-18]Y1-973 was consistent with the known NPY Y1 distribution; uptake was highest in the striatum and cortical regions and lowest in the pons, cerebellum nuclei, and brain stem. Blockade of [F-18]Y1-973 uptake with NPY Y1 antagonist Y1-718 revealed a specific signal that was dose-dependently reduced in all regions of grey matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake, indicative of an NPY Y1 specific signal. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]Y1-973 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the in vivo PET studies. Highest binding density was observed in the dentate gyrus, caudate-putamen, and cortical regions; moderate binding density in the hypothalamus and thalamus; and lowest binding density in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human caudate-putamen homogenates confirmed a similarly high B-max/K-d ratio for [F-18]Y1-973, suggesting the tracer may provide a specific signal in human brain of similar magnitude to that observed in rhesus monkey. [F-18]Y1-973 is a suitable PET tracer for imaging NPY Y1 in rhesus monkey with potential for translation to human PET studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We report here the development of 3-(2-(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifzetidine) as a new putative high-affinity antagonist for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifzetidine in rat brain homogenate assays containing alpha 4 beta 2 sites labeled with H-3-cytisine exhibited a binding affinity: Ki=0.67 nM. The fluorine-18 analog, 3-(2-(5)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-nifzetidine), was synthesized in 20%-40% yield, and apparent specific activity was estimated to be above 2 Ci/mu mol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifzetidine to thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >85% by 150 mu M nicotine. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of F-18-nifzetidine in anesthetized rhesus monkey showed slow uptake in the various brain regions. Retention of (1)8(F)-nifzetidine was maximal in the thalamus and lateral geniculate followed by regions of the temporal and frontal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least uptake. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio was about 2.3 at 180 min postinjection and continued to rise. F-18-Nifzetidine shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. However, the slow kinetics suggests a need for >3-h PET scans for quantitative studies of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the soma distributions of all those corticospinal neuron populations projecting to different zones in the cervical and more caudal spinal segments in the macaque that are labeled with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers; 2-4 differentiable dyes were injected into different sites in the cervical spinal cord of each of 11 monkeys. Lamina V of the cerebral cortex, in which all corticospinal neuron somas were located, was unfolded with computer assistance to form a flat surface, and local soma densities were displayed on this plane as contour and 3-D maps. At least nine discrete, somatotopically organized corticospinal projections were identified. Three separate corticospinal projections originated in frontal cortex. The first projected mostly from area 4 (approximate to 35% of the total contralateral neuron population), but also from the adjacent dorsolateral area 6a alpha (approximate to 6% of total). The second large corticospinal projection (approximate to 15% of total) originated in the supplementary motor area and a third small projection (approximate to 2.6% of total) projected from the ''postarcuate'' cortex. Two separate corticospinal neuron populations were identified in areas 24 (approximate to 6% of total) and 23 (approximate to 4% of total) of the cingulate cortex. Thus, nearly 70% of the contralateral corticospinal projection originated in frontal and cingulate cortex. At the boundary between the primary motor and somatosensory cortex there was a sharp change in the pattern of projections. Only approximate to 2.2% of the contralateral corticospinal projection originated in area 3a, rising to approximate to 9% in areas 3b/1, and approximate to 13% in areas 2/5. The projections from SII and insula totaled 3.4%. Ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal projection patterns were similar, but the ipsilateral projection was only approximate to 8.1% of that from the contralateral cortex. Each corticospinal neuron population had terminals in the intermediate zone of all spinal segments; additionally, there were ventral horn projections from the primary motor and cingulate cortex, and dorsal horn projections from the somatosensory cortex. Recognizing a number of separate populations of corticospinal neurons in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortex, each with unique thalamic and cortical inputs, and each of which has continuous access to all spinal motoneuron populations, underlines the importance of cortical and spinal connections linking them and coordinating their action. No coherent model of the cortical control of limb movements that incorporates this functional anatomy yet exists.";"UNIV MELBOURNE, HOWARD FLOREY INST EXPTL PHYSIOL & MED, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA; UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, BRAIN RES LAB, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA";"Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne";;;Galea, Mary/F-4242-2010;Galea, Mary/0000-0003-0045-7978;;;;;115;249;252;0;8;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to determine the degree of labeled overlap in both of these subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from the vibrissal representation in MI were more extensive than corresponding projections from SI. Both cortical areas sent dense projections to the dorsolateral neostriatum, but the MI vibrissal representation also projected to regions located more rostrally and medially. Despite these differences, both MI and Sl projected to overlapping parts of the dorsolateral neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the medial sector of the posterior complex of the thalamus (POm). Because POm is somatotopically organized and has reciprocal. connections with both Sl and MI cortices, the amount of labeled overlap in POm was used to indicate whether the tracers were injected into corresponding whisker representations of MI and SI. We found that the proportion of labeled overlap in the neostriatum was highly correlated with the amount of labeled overlap in POm. These results indicate that the rodent neostriatum receives convergent projections from corresponding regions in MI and SI cortex. Furthermore, the thalamocortical projections of the POm indicate that it may modulate corticostriatal outputs from corresponding representations in MI and SI.

The object of this study is to confirm by immunoelectron-microscopy the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic connections containing parvalbumin in the monkey visual cortex, by the demonstration of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity in symmetric and asymmetric synapses. We analyzed the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive profiles at the ultrastructural level in the primary visual cortex of old world monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). It has been shown by others that parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells resemble non-spiny stellate cells, double-bouquet cells, chandelier and basket cells2,8,16,21. These neurons are known to be inhibitory and to form symmetric synapses. In fact, we observed that the vast majority of parvalbumin-immunoreactive synaptic contacts in the primary visual cortex of Macaca fascicularis are of the symmetric type (81.7%). Since parvalbumin-positive asymmetric contacts are also present (18.3%) and occur mostly in the thalamic recipient layers, 4C and 4A (9.9%), these afferents probably derive from parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons located in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.;"UNIV FRIBOURG,INST HISTOL,PEROLLES,CH-1700 FRIBOURG,SWITZERLAND; UNIV KIEL,INST ANAT,W-2300 KIEL 1,GERMANY; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,FISHBERG RES CTR NEUROBIOL,NEW YORK,NY 10029; CUNY MT SINAI SCH MED,DEPT GERIATR & ADULT DEV,NEW YORK,NY 10029";"University of Fribourg; University of Kiel; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai";;;"Celio, Marco R/O-5193-2014; Blumcke, Ingmar/D-4705-2018; Morrison, John H/F-9229-2012";"Celio, Marco R/0000-0002-3623-842X; Blumcke, Ingmar/0000-0001-8676-0788; ";NIA NIH HHS [AG06647, AG05138] Funding Source: Medline;NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA));;;27;54;54;0;2;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0006-8993;;;BRAIN RES;Brain Res.;JUL 19;1991;554;1-2;;;;;237;243;;10.1016/0006-8993(91)90195-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(91)90195-2;;;7;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;FZ504;1933306;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991FZ50400032;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the effectiveness of this technique has been limited by few methods to quantify in three dimensions the relative locations of brain structures, recording chambers and microelectrode trajectories. Here we present such a method. After surgical implantation, recording chambers are fitted with a plastic cylinder that is filled with a high-contrast agent to aid in the segmentation of the cylinder from brain matter in an MRI volume. The resulting images of the filled cylinder correspond to a virtual cylinder that is projected along its long axis - parallel to the trajectories of microelectrodes advanced through the recording chamber - through the three-dimensional image of the brain. This technique, which does not require a stereotaxic coordinate system, can be used to quantify the coverage of an implanted recording chamber relative to anatomical landmarks at any depth or orientation. We have used this technique in conjunction with Caret [Van Essen DC, Drury HA, Dickson J, Harwell J, Hanlon D, Anderson CH. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex.

Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent K+ conductances contribute to a slow AHP in thalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons: a novel target for orexin receptors. J Neurophysiol 104: 2052-2062, 2010. First published August 18, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00320.2010. Thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) neurons exhibit a postburst apamin-resistant slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) that is unique to midline thalamus, displays activity dependence, and is abolished in tetrodotoxin. Analysis of the underlying sI(AHP) confirmed a requirement for Ca2+ influx with contributions from P/Q-, N-, L-, and R subtype channels, a reversal potential near E-K(+) and a significant reduction by UCL-2077, barium or TEA, consistent with a role for K-Ca channels. sI(AHP) was significantly reduced by activation of either the cAMP or the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Further analysis of the sAHP revealed an activity-dependent but Ca2+-independent component that was reduced in high [K+](o) and blockable after Na+ substitution with Li+ or in the presence of quinidine, suggesting a role for K-Na channels. The Ca2+-independent sAHP component was selectively reduced by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. The sAHP contributed to spike frequency adaptation, which was sensitive to activation of either cAMP or PKC signaling pathways and, near the peak of membrane hyperpolarization, was sufficient to cause de-inactivation of low threshold T-Type Ca2+ channels, thus promoting burst firing. PVT neurons are densely innervated by orexin-immunoreactive fibers, and depolarized by exogenously applied orexins. We now report that orexin A significantly reduced both Ca2+-dependent and -independent sI(AHP), and spike frequency adaptation. Furthermore orexin A-induced sI(AHP) inhibition was mediated through activation of PKC but not PKA. Collectively, these observations suggest that K-Ca and K-Na channels have a role in a sAHP that contributes to spike frequency adaptation and neuronal excitability in PVT neurons and that the sAHP is a novel target for modulation by the arousal-and feeding-promoting orexin neuropeptides.";"[Renaud, Leo P.] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Neurosci Program, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada; Univ Ottawa, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada";"University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa";Renaud, LP (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Neurosci Program, 725 Parkdale Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada.;lprenaud@ohri.ca;;Renaud, Leo/0000-0002-8559-8675;"Canadian Institutes of Health [MOP-77745]; Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery; Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa";"Canadian Institutes of Health(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada); Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa";This work was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant MOP-77745, the Heart and Stroke Foundation Centre for Stroke Recovery, and the Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa.

Localization, cell surface expression, and activity-dependent regulation of glutamate receptors in both neurons and glia are performed and maintained by a complex network of protein-protein interactions associated with targeting, anchoring, and spatially organizing synaptic proteins at the cell membrane. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of transcripts encoding the AMPA receptor sub-units (GluR1-GluR4) and a family of AMPA-related intracellular proteins. We focused on PDZ-proteins that are involved in the regulated pool and anchoring AMPA subunits to the cell membrane (PICK1, syntenin), and those maintaining the constitutive pool of AMPA receptors at the glutamatergic synapse (NSF, stargazin). In addition, we studied a fifth protein, KIAA1719, with high homology to the rat PDZ protein ABP, associated with the clustering of AMPA receptors at the glutamate synapse. The AMPA subunits showed significant differences in regional expression, especially in the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. The expression of other proteins, even those related to a specific AMPA subunit (such as ABP and PICK1 to GluR2 and GluR3), often had different distributions, whereas others (like NSF) are ubiquitously distributed in the brain. These results suggest that AMPA subunits and related intracellular proteins are differentially distributed in the macaque brain, and in numerous structures there are significant mismatches, suggesting additional functional properties of the associated intracellular proteins.

In addition to afferent inputs common to the whole MFC, each subdivision of the MFC has a specific pattern of afferent connections. The dorsally situated precentral medial area (PrCm) was the only area to receive inputs from the somatosensory cortex. The specific pattern of afferents common to the ventrally situated prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas included projections from the agranular insular cortex, the entorhinal and piriform cortices, the CA1-CA2 fields of the hippocampus, the subiculum, the endopiriform nucleus, the amygdalopiriform transition, the amygdalohippocampal area, the lateral tegmentum, and the parabrachial nucleus. In all these structures, the number of retrogradely labeled cells was larger when the injection site was located in area IL. The dorsal part of the anterior cingulate area (ACd) seemed to be connectionally intermediate between the adjacent areas PrCm and PL; it receives neither the somatosensory inputs characteristic of area PrCm nor the afferents characteristic of areas PL and IL, with the exception of the afferents from the caudal part of the retrosplenial cortex. A comparison of the pattern of afferent and efferent connections of the rat MFC with the pattern of macaque prefrontal cortex suggests that PrCm and ACd areas share some properties with the macaque premotor cortex, whereas PL and IL areas may have characteristics in common with the cingulate or with medial areas 24, 25, and 32 and with orbital areas 12, 13, and 14 of macaques.

Recovery of hand function is rapid, and, although it is incomplete, within a few months, the monkey uses the initially disabled hand and fingers with considerable skill. We examined the accompanying changes in the pattern of projection of corticospinal neurons to the cervical spinal cord that occurred following such a lesion. Spinal section was done both in newborn and juvenile macaques, and the postlesion period was followed for up to 150 weeks. Corticospinal neuron populations were visualized by using both anterogradely and retrogradely transported labels, and their origins, spinal pathways, and terminations were examined at intervals during the period of recovery of hand function. Immediately following unilateral section of the spinal cord at C3, sampled counts of soma profiles of retrogradely labeled neurons indicated that there was a profound reduction in the corticospinal projection to the hemicord caudal to the lesion. The few labeled corticospinal axons spared by the lesion bypassed the spinal lesion by descending in the contralateral cord and then crossing the midline caudal to the lesion. A few corticospinal axons may also have bypassed the lesion in the ipsilateral ventromedial column when this was not fully interrupted by the lesion. In every monkey, we observed a similar, profound reduction in the corticospinal (and rubrospinal) projections to the hemicord caudal to the lesion: This pattern did not alter significantly over an extended recovery period. An unchanging corticospinal projection to the cervical spinal cord contralateral to the lesion was also visualized in each monkey and resembled that seen in the normal macaque. Although the resolution of the labeling and counting procedures used precluded the identification of small increases in the numbers of corticospinal neurons projecting to the hemicord caudal to the lesion, we concluded that there was no substantial reconstruction of this projection over a recovery period of more than 2 years.

Deposits of anterograde tracers were made in the two lateral-most subdivisions of the central complex, i.e., the middle part (or pars media) and the lateral part (or pars paralateralis). All injections avoided the pars parafascicularis. The intrastriatal distribution of labeled axonal endings was mapped in relation to the standard ventricular (CA-CP) system of coordinates. Labeled endings were observed in the major posterior and dorsal parts of the putamen (excluding its anteromedial and ventral parts) and also in a restricted ventrolateral part of the caudate nucleus. The topography of the central territory of the striatum, defined as the striatal space receiving axons from the central complex, was found to correspond exactly to that of the cortical sensorimotor territory delineated after cortical injections. The termination pattern of the central axons within the striatum was patchy. Viewed as a whole, the irregular and hazy patches formed oblique streaks, parallel one with the other. The three-dimensional reconstructions of data from transverse sections revealed that the streaks were bi-dimensional pictures of three-dimensional parasagittal layers covering the whole anteroposterior extent of the cortical sensorimotor territory of the striatum. Our work shows that the pars media of the central complex, which receives selectively pallidal afferent axons (Francois et al., '88: Brain Res. 473:181-186), is the main source of the centroputaminal projection. The probable implication of this in a closed sensorimotor loop of the basal ganglia is discussed.;HOP ENFANTS JESUS, CTR RECH NEUROBIOL, QUEBEC CITY G1J 1Z4, QUEBEC, CANADA;Laval University;FRANCOIS, C (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, NEUROMORPHOL & NEUROL MOUVEMENT LAB, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE.;;"Yelnik, Jérôme/F-7153-2013; Fenelon, Gilles/R-3361-2018";YELNIK, Jerome/0000-0003-4814-708X;;;;;50;66;68;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Evidence for more direct sensorimotor links is now presented to show that cerebral cortex rarely, if ever, receives messages representing receptor activity only; thalamic inputs to cortex also carry copies of current motor instructions. Pathways afferent to the thalamus represent the primary input to neocortex. Generally they are made up of branching axons that send one branch to the thalamus and another to output centers of the brain stem or spinal cord. The information transmitted through the classical sensory pathways to the thalamus represents not only information about the environment and the body, but also about instructions currently on their way to motor centers. The proposed hierarchy of direct corticocortical connections of the sensory pathways is not the only possible hierarchy of cortical connections. There is also a hierarchy of the corticofugal pathways to motor centers in the midbrain, and there are transthalamic corticocortical pathways that may show a comparable hierarchy. The extent to which these hierarchies may match each other, and relate to early developmental changes are poorly defined at present, but are important for understanding mechanisms that can link action and perception in the developing brain.";Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Madison, WI 53706 USA;"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Guillery, RW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anat, 1300 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;rguiller@wisc.edu;;;;;;;120;33;35;1;13;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0079-6123;;0-444-51679-4;PROG BRAIN RES;Prog.

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10-15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28-35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.;"[Hussin, Ahmed T.; Hoffman, Kari L.] York Univ, Ctr Vis Res, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Abbaspoor, Saman; Hoffman, Kari L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Hoffman, Kari L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Biomed Engn, Nashville, TN 37240 USA";"York University - Canada; Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University";"Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), York Univ, Ctr Vis Res, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.;Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;Hoffman, KL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, Vanderbilt Vis Res Ctr, Biomed Engn, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.";kari.hoffman@vanderbilt.edu;Hoffman, Kari L/I-3062-2012;Hoffman, Kari L/0000-0003-0560-8157;"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant [1RF1NS127128-01]; Krembil Foundation [501100004089]; Fondation Brain Canada Grant [100009408]; Whitehall Foundation [100001391]; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Society of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [501100000038]";"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Krembil Foundation; Fondation Brain Canada Grant; Whitehall Foundation; Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIARSpanish Government); Alzheimer's Association(Alzheimer's Association); Alzheimer's Society of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)";This work was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant 1RF1NS127128-01, Krembil Foundation Grant 501100004089, Fondation Brain Canada Grant 100009408, Whitehall Foundation Grant 100001391, Canada Foundation for Innovation, Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Society of Canada, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant 501100000038.

The retrograde tracer experiments demonstrate projections to the FAG that arise primarily from the medial prefrontal areas 25, 32, and 10m, anterior cingulate, and dorsomedial areas 24b and 9, select orbital areas 14c, 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l, and ventrolateral area 6v. Only scattered cells were retrogradely labeled in other areas in the PFC. Caudal to the PFC, projections to the PAG also arise from the posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal dysgranular, and granular parts of the temporal polar cortex, the ventral insula, and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Cells were also labeled in subcortical structures, including the central nucleus and ventrolateral part of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal PAG columns. The projections from medial prefrontal areas 10m, 25, and 32 end predominantly in the dorsolateral columns, bilaterally. Fibers from orbital areas 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l terminate primarily in the ventrolateral column, whereas fibers from dorsomedial areas 9 and 24b terminate mainly in the lateral column. The PFC areas that project to the PAG include most of the areas previously defined as the medial prefrontal network. The areas that comprise this network represent a visceromotor system, distinct from the sensory related orbital network.

We tested whether this simply reflects the uneven distribution of ganglion cells in the retina in accordance with the ''principle'' of peripheral scaling, or whether there is additional expansion of the fovea and adjacent retina in the retinocortical projection. Wheatgerm agglutinated horseradish peroxidase was injected into the striate cortex of three rhesus macaque monkeys so as to surround the representation of the fovea at a mean eccentricity of 8.6 degrees, and the retinae were processed histochemically to stain the retrogradely and transneuronally labelled ganglion cells which projected topographically to the injection sites. This enabled regions of the striate cortex to be related precisely to corresponding regions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and retina. Mathematical models of the distribution of ganglion cells in the retina, dipped, three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the striate cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus, and counts of neurons in the latter, were used to calculate the proportion of neurons allocated to the marked perifoveal region at each stage of projection. This was used to calculate the relative allocation of neurons to the representation of the fovea and surrounding retina among the different stages of the visual pathway. The values obtained showed that the cortical representation of the perifovea was expanded two to three times more than could be accounted for on the basis of ganglion cell topography in the retina, and that the expansion occurred both between the retina and the thalamus, and between the thalamus and the cortex. These results are inconsistent with the idea that peripheral scaling is a general principle of sensory representation in the cortex. They could also explain why many visual thresholds, including hyperacuities, cannot be accounted for by peripheral factors such as ganglion cell density.;;;Azzopardi, P (corresponding author), DEPT EXPTL PSYCHOL,S PARKS RD,OXFORD OX1 3UD,ENGLAND.;;Azzopardi, Paul/C-5694-2013;Azzopardi, Paul/0000-0001-7386-8191;;;;;86;37;37;0;4;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;JUN;1996;72;3;;;;;627;639;;10.1016/0306-4522(95)00589-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)00589-7;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;UH118;9157310;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1996UH11800004;View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study examined with quantitative immunohistochemical methods the presence of glutamate in spinothalamic tract terminals of owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus). Such terminals in the posterior region, in which a nucleus was recently identified as a specific pain and temperature relay in macaques and humans, were labeled by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, injected into the spinal dorsal horn. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated with a postembedding immunogold procedure using a well-characterized glutamate antiserum. Quantitative analysis of the immunogold labeling demonstrated that the spinothalamic tract terminals contained more than twice the tissue average of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Enrichment of glutamate-like immunoreactivity was also found in terminals of presumed cortical origin. Presynaptic dendrites, cell bodies and non-vesicle-containing dendrites diplayed low levels of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.69; P<0.0001) was found between the density of synaptic vesicles and the density of gold particles in spinothalamic tract terminals, in contrast to a weak negative relationship (r=-0.28; P=0.089) present in GABAergic presynaptic dendrites. These data provide strong evidence that the gold labeling in the spinothalamic tract terminals represents transmitter labeling, implying that glutamate is a neurotransmitter for ascending nociceptive and thermoreceptive information in primates.";BARROW NEUROL INST,DIV NEUROBIOL,PHOENIX,AZ 85013;Barrow Neurological Institute;Blomqvist, A (corresponding author), LINKOPING UNIV,FAC HLTH SCI,DEPT CELL BIOL,S-58185 LINKOPING,SWEDEN.;;Blomqvist, Anders/K-3990-2019;Blomqvist, Anders/0000-0002-6928-4473;NINDS NIH HHS [NS25616] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;64;21;21;0;1;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0014-4819;;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

The specificity of SEF pathways was determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry to compare its connections with those of the arcuate frontal eye field (FEF), contiguous dorsocaudal area 6 (6DC), and primary motor cortex (M1, arm/hand region). Results indicate that patterns of SEF connectivity were similar to the FEF and markedly different from areas 6DC and M1. Primary reciprocal thalamic pathways of the SEF were with the magnocellular ventral anterior (VA) nucleus, medial parvicellular VA, medial area X, and paralaminar medialis dorsalis (multiformis and parvicellularis). FEF showed similar connections but its most robust pathway was with MD rather than VA. In contrast, area 6DC showed the most extensive reciprocal connections with lateral VApc and lateral area X with only sparse connections with paralaminar MD. Area 6DC also exhibited reciprocal connections with the ventral lateral (VL) complex and the ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis (VPLo). M1 showed dense bidirectional connections with VPLo, and to a lesser extent, with VL. M1 pathways with the medial dorsal nucleus were negligible. All areas exhibited connections with the paracentral and central lateral nuclei and only M1 lacked connections with the central superior lateral nucleus. SEF and FEF exhibited similar efferent projections to the caudate and putamen. In the caudate, terminal fields were restricted to a central longitudinal core while those from area 6DC were more widely distributed. Eye field efferents were restricted to the putamen's face region while 6DC projections were more exuberant. The arm/hand region of M1 projected to the arm/hand region of the putamen.

In two cases the lesions were limited to the left thalamus, and in the third the right thalamus was involved. These deficits were associated with ipsilateral diencephalic, striatal, and dorsolateral prefrontal hypoperfusion. The damage implicated the ventral anterior nucleus, the mamillothalamic tract, and the rostroventral internal medullary lamina. These findings suggest that medial thalamic damage involving the ventral and rostral sector of the dorsal thalamus will concurrently affect functionally and neurally distinct limbodiencephalic pathways and diencephalic connections with the frontal cortex. A review of the neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings from previously reported cases with vascular lesions of the thalamus further supports this contention. The presence of frontal lobe-related cognitive deficits, though not obligatorily related to the memory problems, may contribute to some aspects of the memory deficits and affect the nature of the memory disorder observed in some cases with diencephalic amnesia.;CTR HOSP COTE DES NEIGES, RES CTR, MONTREAL, PQ, CANADA;;PEPIN, EP (corresponding author), CTR HOSP LACHINE, MEM CLIN, 650 16TH AVE, LACHINE H8S 3N5, PQ, CANADA.;;;;;;;;80;58;59;0;1;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0028-3878;1526-632X;;NEUROLOGY;Neurology;APR;1993;43;4;;;;;733;741;;10.1212/WNL.43.4.733;http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.43.4.733;;;9;Clinical Neurology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;KX812;8469332;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1993KX81200019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Various mechanisms, including divergence of preexisting connections, expression of latent synapses, and sprouting of new synapses, have been proposed to explain such phenomena, which probably underlie altered sensory experiences associated with limb amputation and peripheral nerve injury in humans. Putative cortical mechanisms have received the greatest emphasis but there is increasing evidence for substantial reorganization in subcortical structures, including the brainstem and thalamus, that may be of sufficient extent to account for or play a large part in representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex. Recent studies show that divergence of ascending connections is considerable and sufficient to ensure that small alterations in map topography at brainstem and thalamic levels will be amplified in the projection to the cortex. In the long term, slow, deafferentation-dependent transneuronal atrophy at brainstem, thalamic, and even cortical levels are operational in promoting reorganizational changes, and the extent to which surviving connections can maintain a map is a key to understanding differences between central and peripheral deafferentation.;Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA;"University of California System; University of California Davis";Jones, EG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;ejones@ucdavis.edu;;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS21377] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;169;263;271;2;18;ANNUAL REVIEWS;PALO ALTO;4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA;0147-006X;1545-4126;;ANNU REV NEUROSCI;Annu.

To examine the role of the anterior ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VLa) in motor control, extracellular single-cell recordings were made from the VLa nucleus in three conscious monkeys performing visually triggered, rapid movements requiring flexion and extension of the wrist joint. The movement paradigms consisted of three components: an initial hold period, a ballistic movement, and a final hold period. 2. Cerebellar nuclear stimulation was used to physiologically identify thalamic neurons receiving input from the cerebellum. Neurons subsequently confirmed histologically as lying within the VLa nucleus were located anterior to those ''driven'' by cerebellar stimulation. 3. The activities of 261 VLa neurons displaying movement-related behavior were examined. In the absence of movement, the activity of these neurons ranged from 5 to 80 spikes/s, the majority of cells (222/261; 85%) firing between 10 and 30 spikes/s. Neural activity was not influenced by afferent input from skin, joint, or muscle but altered markedly when the animal engaged in active movement. 4. The relationship between neural activity and movement at a specific joint was determined in 189 of the 261 neurons. The majority of these neurons (161/189; 85%) modulated their activity in response to movement confined to a single joint; the remaining neurons displayed multijoint motor responses, their activity being best related to a motor act, such as grasping, reaching, or feeding. There was no clear segregation in the representation of body parts in the VLa nucleus to suggest the presence of clearly defined somatotopy. 5. The activities of wrist-related neurons (45 of the 261) were examined to determine the motor characteristics of the VLa nucleus. Three distinctive activity patterns were exhibited by these neurons during the performance of the movement paradigms: 1) a phasic burst of <300 ms in duration (34/45; 76%); 2) a sustained change in neural activity lasting >300 ms (typically up to 1,000 ms; 4/45; 9%); and 3) both a phasic and a sustained response, the sustained response occurring either prior or subsequent to the phasic response (7/45; 15%). 6. The movement-related activity of the wrist-related neurons occurred late, 52% firing after the onset of the forearm electromyogram (EMG). In 47% of the neurons, discharge rate was related to movement direction and, in a smaller proportion (13%), joint position. No relationship was found between neural activity patterns and amplitude of movement or velocity of movement. 7. The timing and pattern of neural activity in VLa indicates that it is unlikely that cells in this nucleus are involved in the selection or activation of muscles for the initiation of a motor action or the coding of the physical parameters of movement.";"MONASH UNIV,DEPT ANAT,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA; MONASH MED CTR,DEPT NEUROL,CLAYTON,VIC 3168,AUSTRALIA";"Monash University; Monash University";;;"Horne, Malcolm/AAL-5214-2020; Finkelstein, David/B-9617-2009";"Horne, Malcolm/0000-0001-9427-2100; Finkelstein, David/0000-0002-8167-4917";;;;;60;19;19;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We found that all nodulus-target neurons are tuned to vestibular stimuli, and most are insensitive to eye movements. Such non-eye-movement neurons are thought to project to vestibulo-spinal and/or thalamo-cortical pathways. Less than 20% of nodulus-target neurons were sensitive to eye movements, suggesting that the caudal vermis can also directly influence vestibulo-ocular pathways. In general, response properties of nodulus-target neurons were diverse, spanning the whole continuum previously described in the vestibular nuclei. Most nodulus-target cells responded to both rotation and translation stimuli and only a few were selectively tuned to translation motion only. Other neurons were sensitive to net linear acceleration, similar to otolith afferents. These results demonstrate that, unlike the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus which target a particular cell group, nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition targets a large diversity of cell types in the vestibular nuclei, consistent with a broad functional significance contributing to vestibulo-ocular, vestibulo-thalamic and vestibulo-spinal pathways.;"[Meng, Hui; Dickman, J.

To study the development of these connections in humans, regions of fixed brain from fetuses of 20-22 gestational weeks (GW) were injected with the fluorescent tracer DiI. Placement of DiI in the optic nerve or tract labeled retinogeniculate projections. In the LGN, these projections were already segregated into eye-specific layers by 20 GW. Retinogeniculate segregation thus preceded cellular lamination of the LGN, which did not commence until 22 GW. Thalamocortical axons, labeled from DiI injections into the optic radiations, densely innervated the subplate, but did not significantly innervate the cortical plate. This pattern was consistent with observations of a waiting period in animals, when thalamocortical axons synapse in the subplate for days or weeks before entering the cortical plate. Cortical efferent neurons (labeled retrogradely from the optic radiations) were located in the subplate and deep layers of the cortical plate. In summary, human visual connections are partially formed by mid-gestation, and undergo further refinement during and after this period.

Optimal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents are therefore highly desired for this receptor. We report here the development and initial evaluation of 2-fluro-3-[2-((S)-3-pyrrolinyl)methoxy]pyridine (nifene). In vitro binding affinity of nifene in rat brain homogenate using H-3-cytisine exhibited a K-i=0.50 nM for the alpha 4 beta 2 sites. The radiosynthesis of 2-F-18-fluoro-3-[2-((S)-3-pyrrolinyl)methoxy]pyridine (F-18-nifene) was accomplished in 2.5 h with an overall radiochemical yield of 40-50%, decay corrected. The specific activity was estimated to be approx. 37-185 GBq/mu mol. In vitro alltoradiography in rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifene to anteroventral thalamic (AVT) nucleus, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. Rat cerebellum showed some binding, whereas regions in the hippocampus had the lowest binding. The highest ratio of > 13 between AVT and cerebellum was measured for F-18-nifene in rat brain slices. The specific binding was reduced (> 95%) by 300 mu M nicotine in these brain regions. Positron emission tomography imaging Study of F-18-nifene (130 MBq) in anesthetized rhesus monkey was carried Out using all ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. PET Study showed selective maximal uptake in the regions of the anterior medial thalamus, ventro-lateral thalamus, lateral geniculate, cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex including the subiculum. The cerebellum in the monkeys showed lower binding than the other regions, Thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio peaked at 30-35 min postinjection to a value of 2.2 and subsequently reduced. The faster binding profile of F-18-nifene indicates promise as a PET imaging agent and thus needs further evaluation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The relative balance of flexible, goal-directed responding as compared to inflexible habitual responding is highly dependent on experience (e.g., training history in a task) and conditions under which the behavior was formed. Reinforcer devaluation tasks have been used widely across species to study the neurobiology of goal-directed behavior. In rodents, under some conditions, extended training in reinforcer devaluation tasks transforms goal-directed responses into habits, rendering the animals insensitive to devaluation. In nonhuman primates, no studies have previously evaluated the impact of extended training. Here we trained four macaques in a variant of the standard reinforcer devaluation task (Malkova et al., 1997), in which we presented objects with either a standard number of exposures (i.e., up to 55) or with a high number of exposures (i.e., up to 454). We tested for goal-directed behavior at three time points during the course of this extended training with different combinations of high- and low-repetition objects and stratified results based on whether the preferred or nonpreferred reinforcer was devalued. We found robust devaluation effects across all three cycles of training; however, the magnitude of the effect was modulated by reinforcer preference and by the relative training history of the objects. These data argue against habit formation after overtraining in the reinforcer devaluation task in macaques, a finding that is consistent with reports in humans and with tasks in rodents that employ multiple stimuli, reinforcers, and instrumental actions.";"[LaFlamme, Elyssa M.; Ahmed, Farris; Forcelli, Patrick A.; Malkova, Ludise] Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W215,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA";Georgetown University;"Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W215,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Forcelli, PA; Malkova, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, New Res Bldg,Room W209B,3800 Reservoir Rd, Washington, DC 20057 USA.";"paf22@georgetown.edu; malkoval@georgetown.edu";Forcelli, Patrick A/G-6970-2012;"LaFlamme, Elyssa/0000-0003-3820-9478; Forcelli, Patrick/0000-0003-1763-060X; Ahmed, Farris/0000-0001-9747-4971";;;;;81;2;2;1;1;AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;0735-7044;1939-0084;;BEHAV NEUROSCI;Behav.

LGN responses are largely low-pass in spatial frequency, whereas the majority of V1 neurons have bandpass characteristics. To study this transformation in spatial selectivity, we measured the dynamics of spatial frequency tuning using a reverse correlation technique. We find that a large proportion of V1 cells show inseparable responses in spatial frequency and time. In several cases, tuning becomes more selective over the course of the response, and the preferred spatial frequency shifts from low to higher frequencies. Many responses also show suppression at low spatial frequencies, which correlates with the increases in response selectivity and the shifts of preferred spatial frequency. These results indicate that suppression plays an important role in the generation of bandpass selectivity in V1.;"Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Brain Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA";"University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles";Bredfeldt, CE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 405 Hilgard Ave,Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;gecko@ucla.edu;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY-12816, R01 EY012816] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;43;149;150;1;17;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Whether human children are vulnerable to this toxicity mechanism remains unknown, as there are no imaging techniques to capture it. Apoptosis is characterized by distinct structural features, which affect the way damaged tissue scatters ultrasound compared to healthy tissue. We evaluated whether apoptosis, triggered by the anesthetic sevoflurane in the brains of neonatal rhesus macaques, can be detected using quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Neonatal (n = 15) rhesus macaques underwent 5 h of sevoflurane anesthesia. QUS images were obtained through the sagittal suture at 0.5 and 6 h. Brains were collected at 8 h and examined immunohistochemically to analyze apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Significant apoptosis was detected in white and gray matter throughout the brain, including the thalamus. We measured a change in the effective scatterer size (ESS), a QUS biomarker derived from ultrasound echo signals obtained with clinical scanners, after sevoflurane-anesthesia in the thalamus. Although initial inclusion of all measurements did not reveal a significant correlation, when outliers were excluded, the change in the ESS between the pre- and post-anesthesia measurements correlated strongly and proportionally with the severity of apoptotic death. We report for the first time in vivo changes in QUS parameters, which may reflect severity of apoptosis in the brains of infant nonhuman primates. These findings suggest that QUS may enable in vivo studies of apoptosis in the brains of human infants following exposure to anesthetics, antiepileptics and other brain injury mechanisms.;"[Rosado-Mendez, Ivan M.; Castaneda-Martinez, Laura] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fis, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rosado-Mendez, Ivan M.; Guerrero, Quinton W.; Whitson, Hayley; Zagzebski, James A.; Hall, Timothy J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Phys, Sch Med, 1530 Med Sci Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Noguchi, Kevin K.; Wang, Sophie H.; Swiney, Brant S.; Masuoka, Kobe] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Kirvassilis, George] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Madison, WI USA; [Manzella, Francesca] Univ Colorado, Neurosci Program, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Capuano, Saverio, III; Brunner, Kevin G.; Crosno, Kristin; Simmons, Heather S.; Mejia, Andres F.] Wisconsin Natl Primate Res Ctr, Madison, WI USA; [Brambrink, Ansgar] Columbia Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, New York, NY USA; [Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Columbia University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Ikonomidou, C (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Child Neurol, 1685 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.;Ikonomidou@neurology.wisc.edu;;"Manzella, Francesca/0000-0003-1296-2015; Castaneda-Martinez, Laura/0000-0003-0104-5705; Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy/0000-0002-8961-226X";"NIH [P51OD011106, HD052664, U54-HD087011]; NIH/NICHD [R01HD083001-01A1]; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University; UNAM-PAPIIT [IA104518, IN107916]; CONACyT";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH/NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University; UNAM-PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))";"This research was supported by pilot grant award, Office of the Director, NIH P51OD011106 to WNPRC and NIH/NICHD R01HD083001-01A1 grant to C.

Large injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase or small injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were made in the medial geniculate complex of Macaca fuscata. The terminal distributions of labeled axons in the cortex were correlated with auditory cortical fields demonstrable by different intensities of immunoreactivity for parvalbumin. Fibers from the ventral nucleus terminated mainly in layer TV and deep portion of layer III (IIIB), with additional terminations in layers I-IIIA and in layer VI. In layers IIIB-IV, a major terminal plexus was formed by a small number of dense patches, 300-500 mu m in diameter, surrounded by smaller satellite patches. The patches conformed to a similarly lobulated pattern of parvalbumin fiber immunoreactivity. Terminations of some individually labeled thalamocortical fibers were restricted to a single patch, whereas others innervated more than one patch by collateral branches. Fibers from the dorsad nuclei ending in areas of less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity surrounding the primary auditory cortex formed much larger terminal patches centered largely in layer IIIB. Fibers from the magnocellular nucleus had relatively few terminal branches but innervated extremely wide areas by collaterals of single axons. Two types of axons arose from the magnocellular nucleus, one terminating preferentially in middle cortical layers and the other exclusively in layer I. These may arise respectively from parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cell populations in the magnocellular nucleus.

(GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre median/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons.

Lamina I axons in the contralateral spinal white matter were of particular interest, because these include spinothalamic tract (STT) axons. These were clearly concentrated in the middle of the lateral funiculus, that is, in the location of the classically described lateral STT of humans. At the C1-2 level, they were more ventrally located. There was evidence of a general topography, in that lumbar axons were located superficially and cervical axons were located medially. There was some dispersion, in that a few axons were also found move dorsally and more ventrally (especially at the midthoracic level), and there was some variability between cases. In addition, ascending axons were more widely distributed in the ipsilateral white matter. These observations are consistent with prior anterograde findings in the cat. Together with clinical and other evidence, these observations indicate that lamina I neurons have an integral role in the effects of spinal lesions on pain, temperature, and itch sensations.;Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurosurg, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA;Barrow Neurological Institute;Craig, AD (corresponding author), Barrow Neurol Inst, Div Neurosurg, 350 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013 USA.;;;;;;;;107;20;21;0;1;CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE;EDINBURGH;JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND;1526-5900;;;J PAIN;J.

However, visual field specializations have not been studied in the dorsal visual stream, dedicated to processing visual motion and visually guided behaviors. To investigate this, we injected retrograde neuronal tracers occupying the whole visuotopic representation of the middle temporal (MT) visual area in marmoset monkeys and studied the distribution and morphology of the afferent primary visual cortex (V1) projections. Contrary to previous reports, we found a heterogeneous population of V1-MT projecting neurons distributed in layers 3C and 6. In layer 3C, spiny stellate neurons were distributed mainly in foveal representations, while pyramidal morphologies were characteristic of peripheral eccentricities. This primate adaptation of the V1 to MT pathway is arranged in a way that we had not previously understood, with abundant stellate projection neurons in the high-resolution foveal portions, suggesting rapid relay of motion information to visual area MT. We also describe that the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), which is the main thalamic input to area MT, shows a retinotopic organization, likely reflecting the importance of this pathway during development and the establishment of area MT topography.;"[Mundinano, Inaki-Carril; Kwan, William C.; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia";"Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute; Monash University";Bourne, JA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Australian Regenerat Med Inst, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;james.bourne@monash.edu;"Kwan, William/HMW-0054-2023; Bourne, James/B-5265-2018";"Kwan, William/0000-0002-3097-969X; Mundinano, Inaki-Carril/0000-0003-1063-7550; Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108";"Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [APP1138038]; NHMRC [APP1077677]; State Government of Victoria; Australian Government";"Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); State Government of Victoria; Australian Government(Australian Government)";We thank Dr. David A.

This radioligand binds with high affinity and specificity to monkey cortical sections. Specific inhibitors of converting enzyme, lisinopril and perindoprilat compete for the radioligand binding to monkey cortex sections with inhibitory constants of 10 nM. High concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in most components of the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus, putamen, the internal and external globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The distribution of converting enzyme in the caudate nucleus and putamen is heterogeneous, with prominent patches of higher activity. The patches in the caudate nucleus correspond closely with the acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. In the hypothalamus, very high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk and high concentrations occur in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moderate, diffuse binding is observed in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and in the anterior, lateral, ventromedial, posterior and arcuate nuclei. In the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural and subfornical organs exhibit high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the pineal body display moderate enzyme activities whereas the area postrema is devoid of labelling. The interpeduncular nucleus and, in the hippocampal formation, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are also intensely labelled. High levels of angiotensin converting enzyme activity are also detected throughout the cerebral cortex with laminations of higher activity corresponding to cell dense layers of the cortex. Layered binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex, with the most intense labelling in the molecular layer. Moderate concentrations of converting enzyme also occur in the paraventricular, medial habenula, lateral habenula and central median nuclei of the thalamus, the amygdala, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus. The dorsal vagal complex, inferior olivary nucleus and the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus all display high levels of binding. Moderate, diffuse labelling is found throughout the reticular region and is also present in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Although the overall distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme in the monkey brain resembles that in the rat, there are some striking differences. These include the high levels of binding throughout the monkey cerebral cortex and in the interpeduncular and suprachiasmatic nuclei.;"HOWARD FLOREY INST EXPTL PHYSIOL & MED,PARKVILLE,VIC 3052,AUSTRALIA; UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PSYCHOL,KENSINGTON,NSW 2033,AUSTRALIA";"Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of New South Wales Sydney";CHAI, SY (corresponding author), UNIV MELBOURNE,AUSTIN HOSP,DEPT MED,HEIDELBERG,VIC 3084,AUSTRALIA.;;Paxinos, George/E-1840-2012;Paxinos, George/0000-0001-8695-7951;;;;;32;15;15;0;1;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;;1991;42;2;;;;;483;495;;10.1016/0306-4522(91)90391-Z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(91)90391-Z;;;13;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;FN794;1654536;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991FN79400016;View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study examined stimulus-evoked brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female cynomolgus macaques following unilateral L7 spinal nerve ligation and the effects of clinical analgesics pregabalin, duloxetine, and morphine on brain activation in these macaques. A modified straight leg raise test was used to assess pain severity in awake animals and to evoke regional brain activation in anesthetized animals. The potential effects of clinical analgesics on both awake pain behavior and regional brain activation were examined. Following spinal nerve ligation, both male and female macaques showed significantly decreased ipsilateral straight leg raise thresholds, suggesting the presence of radicular-like pain. Morphine treatment increased straight leg raise thresholds in both males and females whereas duloxetine and pregabalin did not. In male macaques, the ipsilateral straight leg raise activated contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII), and thalamus. In female macaques, the ipsilateral leg raise activated cingulate cortex and contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex. Straight leg raises of the contralateral, unligated leg did not evoke brain activation. Morphine reduced activation in all brain regions in both male and female macaques. In males, neither pregabalin nor duloxetine decreased brain activation compared with vehicle treatment. In females, however, pregabalin and duloxetine decreased the activation of cingulate cortex compared with vehicle treatment. The current findings suggest a differential activation of brain areas depending on sex following a peripheral nerve injury. Differential brain activation observed in this study could underlie qualitative sexual dimorphism in clinical chronic pain perception and responses to analgesics. Future pain management approaches for neuropathic pain will need to consider potential sex differences in pain mechanism and treatment efficacy.;"[Murata, Kanae; Nozawa, Kenya; Matsushita, Mayumi; Yamashita, Aozora; Fujii, Rintaro; Awaga, Yuji; Hama, Aldric; Natsume, Takahiro; Takamatsu, Hiroyuki] Hamamatsu Pharm Res Inc, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Yoshida, Go; Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Hamamatsu Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sch Med, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan";Hamamatsu University School of Medicine;Hama, A (corresponding author), Hamamatsu Pharm Res Inc, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan.;aldric-hama@hpharma.jp;;;;;;;43;0;0;1;1;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, Maharashtra, INDIA;1673-5374;1876-7958;;NEURAL REGEN RES;Neural Regen.

The local-global paradigm dissociates two hierarchical levels of auditory predictive coding by examining the brain responses to first-order (local) and second-order (global) sequence violations. Using the macaque model, we previously demonstrated that, in the awake state, local violations cause focal auditory responses while global violations activate a brain circuit comprising prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices. Here we used the same local-global auditory paradigm to clarify the encoding of the hierarchical auditory regularities in anesthetized monkeys and compared their brain responses to those obtained in the awake state as measured with fMRI. Both, propofol, a GABAA-agonist, and ketamine, an NMDA-antagonist, left intact or even enhanced the cortical response to auditory inputs. The local effect vanished during propofol anesthesia and shifted spatially during ketamine anesthesia compared with wakefulness. Under increasing levels of propofol, we observed a progressive disorganization of the global effect in prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices and its complete suppression under ketamine anesthesia. Anesthesia also suppressed thalamic activations to the global effect. These results suggest that anesthesia preserves initial auditory processing, but disturbs both short-term and long-term auditory predictive coding mechanisms. The disorganization of auditory novelty processing under anesthesia relates to a loss of thalamic responses to novelty and to a disruption of higher-order functional cortical networks in parietal, prefrontal and cingular cortices.

It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages in binge alcohol drinking (occasional consumption of four to five drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy alcohol drinking (binge drinking on >5 d in a month). Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years of age) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following similar to 6 and similar to 12 months of daily (22 h/d) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1ml/1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol drinking reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.;"[Shnitko, Tatiana A.; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Xiaojie; Grant, Kathleen A.; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA; [Shnitko, Tatiana A.; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Xiaojie; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Grant, Kathleen A.; Kroenke, Christopher D.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA";"Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon National Primate Research Center; Oregon Health & Science University; Oregon Health & Science University";"Grant, KA; Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.;Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Adv Imaging Res Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;Grant, KA; Kroenke, CD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97239 USA.";"grantka@ohsu.edu; kroenkec@ohsu.edu";;"Wang, Xiaojie/0000-0001-5557-6048; Grant, Kathleen/0000-0002-0380-7219; Shnitko, Tatiana/0000-0002-7872-7408";"NIAAA NIH HHS [U24 AA025473, U01 AA013510, R24 AA019431] Funding Source: Medline; NIH HHS [P51 OD011092] Funding Source: Medline";"NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)";;;66;18;18;0;9;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;;2373-2822;;ENEURO;eNeuro;MAR-APR;2019;6;2;;;;;;;UNSP e0044-19.2019;10.1523/ENEURO.0044-19.2019;http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0044-19.2019;;;11;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;HX1RE;30993181;Green Published, gold;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000467170000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the neuronal specificity achieved with both methods is not well understood. Here we compare cell-targeted optogenetics and electrical microstimulation in the macaque monkey brain to functionally map the koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) projection to primary visual cortex (V1). Selective activation of the LGN konio neurons with CamK-specific optogenetics caused selective electrical current inflow in the supra-granular layers of V1. Electrical microstimulation targeted at LGN konio layers revealed the same supra-granular V1 activation pattern as the one elicited by optogenetics. Taken together, these findings establish a selective koniocellular LGN influence on V1 supra-granular layers, and they indicate comparable capacities of both stimulation methods to isolate thalamo-cortical circuits in the primate brain.;"[Klein, Carsten; Shapcott, Katharine A.; Schmid, Michael C.] Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, Deutschordenstr 46, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany; [Evrard, Henry C.] Univ Tubingen, Werner Reichardt Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Otfried Muller Str 25, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Logothetis, Nikos K.] Univ Manchester, Div Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Klein, Carsten; Evrard, Henry C.; Logothetis, Nikos K.] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Spemannstr 36, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Schmid, Michael C.] Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Klein, Carsten] Univ Tubingen, Int Max Planck Res Sch, Grad Sch Neural & Behav Sci, Osterbergstr 3, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Haverkamp, Silke] Max Planck Inst Brain Res, Max von Laue Str 4, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany";"Max Planck Society; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Max Planck Society; N8 Research Partnership; Newcastle University - UK; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society";"Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Max Planck Gesell, Ernst Strungmann Inst ESI Neurosci Cooperat, Deutschordenstr 46, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.;Schmid, MC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Neurosci, Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.";michael.schmid@ncl.ac.uk;"Logothetis, Nikos/U-9282-2019; Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020; Schmid, Michael C./G-1867-2010";"Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X; Schmid, Michael C./0000-0003-1424-130X; Evrard, Henry/0000-0001-8429-4699";"Emmy Noether grant [Schm2806/1-1]; EU grant SICODE; Max Planck Society";"Emmy Noether grant(German Research Foundation (DFG)); EU grant SICODE; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society)";"We thank Esther Bosch for assistance with histology; Joachim Werner, Hanka Klon-Lippok, Mirko Lindig, Thomas Steudel, and Deniz Ipek for technical assistance; and Drs.

In the present study, we compared the patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate (marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the species but also on the input projections.;"[Otsuka, Yukiko; Tsuge, Hitomi; Uezono, Shiori; Tanabe, Soshi; Fujiwara, Maki; Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Uezono, Shiori] Univ Tokyo Hlth Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Rehabil, Tama Ku, Tokyo 2060033, Japan; [Miwa, Miki; Nakamura, Katsuki] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Cognit Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Kato, Shigeki; Kobayashi, Kazuto] Fukushima Med Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Mol Genet, Sch Med, Fukushima 9601295, Japan";"Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Fukushima Medical University";"Inoue, KI; Takada, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Neurosci, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan.";"otsuka.yukiko.37s@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp; soraironokumo@gmail.com; s-uezono@u-ths.ac.jp; tanabe.soshi.67v@gmail.com; fujiwara.maki.2x@kyoto-u.acjp; miwa.miki.8m@kyoto-u.ac.jp; skato@fmu.ac.jp; nakamura.katsuki.4z@kyoto-u.ac.jp; kazuto@fmu.ac.jp; inoue.kenichi.6z@kyoto-u.ac.jp; takada.masahiko.7x@kyoto-u.ac.jp";"Kato, Shigeki/S-8016-2018; Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015";"Kato, Shigeki/0000-0002-8792-7591; Takada, Masahiko/0000-0003-0774-2333; Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280";"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [JP26112002, JP15H05879, JP17H05565, JP19H05467]; AMED [JP17dm0207052, JP21dm0207077]";"MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); AMED";This work was funded by MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26112002 to K.K., JP15H05879 and JP17H05565 to K.-i.I., and JP19H05467 to M.T. and by AMED Grant Numbers JP17dm0207052 to K.K. and JP21dm0207077 to M.T.;;37;2;2;1;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-4915;;VIRUSES-BASEL;Viruses-Basel;JUL;2021;13;7;;;;;;;1387;10.3390/v13071387;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13071387;;;15;Virology;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Virology;TO4PX;34372593;gold, Green Published;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000676896800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the norepinephrine transporter is a target in the brain of many therapeutic and abused drugs. We used the selective ligand [H-3]nisoxetine, therefore, to describe autoradiographically the normal regional distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate central nervous system, thereby providing a baseline to which alterations due to pathological conditions can be compared. The norepinephrine transporter in the monkey brain was distributed heterogeneously, with highest levels occurring in the locus coeruleus complex and raphe nuclei, and moderate binding density in the hypothalamus, midline thalamic nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and brainstem nuclei such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Low levels of binding to the norepinephrine transporter were measured in basolateral amygdala and cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. The distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate brain was comparable overall to that described in other species, however disparities exist between the rodent and the monkey in brain regions that play a role in such critical processes as memory and learning. The differences in such areas point to the possibility of important functional differences in noradrenergic information processing across species, and suggest the use of caution in applying findings made in the rodent to the human condition.

Some degree of pathway specificity in the utilization of synaptic zinc has been reported in rodents. Here, we use focal injections of the retrograde tracer sodium selenite to identify zinc-positive (Zn+) projection neurons in the monkey ventral visual pathway. After injections in V1, V4, and TEO areas, neurons were detected preferentially in several feedback pathways but, unusually, were restricted to deeper layers without involvement of layers 2 or 3. Temporal injections resulted in more extensive labeling of both feedback and intratemporal association pathways. The Zn+ neurons had a broader laminar distribution, similar to results from standard retrograde tracers. After anterograde tracer injection in area posterior TE, electron microscopic analysis substantiated that a proportion of feedback synapses was colabeled with zinc. Nearby injections, Zn+ intrinsic neurons concentrated in layer 2, but in temporal areas were also abundant in layer 6. These results indicate considerable pathway and laminar specificity as to which cortical neurons use synaptic zinc. Given the hypothesized roles of synaptic zinc, this is likely to result in distinct synaptic properties, possibly including differential synaptic plasticity within or across projections.;"[Ichinohe, Noritaka; Matsushita, Atsuko; Ohta, Kazumi; Rockland, Kathleen S.] RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ichinohe, Noritaka] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Adv, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Ichinohe, Noritaka] Hirosaki Univ, Dept Neuroanat, Grad Sch Med, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368562, Japan; [Rockland, Kathleen S.] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Neural Systemat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan";"RIKEN; Kyoto University; Hirosaki University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)";Ichinohe, N (corresponding author), RIKEN, Lab Cort Org & Systemat, Brain Sci Inst, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.;nichinohe@brain.riken.jp;;"Rockland, Kathleen/0000-0002-6650-8785; Matsushita, Atsuko/0000-0002-8713-4313";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [18020032, 20021033, 21119502]; National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18020032, 20021033, 21119502] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan; National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";"Brain Science Institute, RIKEN; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas System study on higher order brain functions'' and Elucidation of neural network function in the brain'' (18020032, 20021033) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Face perception and recognition'' (21119502) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Joint Research Programs of the National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan, and of the National Institute for Physiological Science, Japan; Grant for Hirosaki University Institutional Research.";;85;14;14;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

In penetrations made into the upper bank of the lateral sulcus in two monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cells were isolated from the second somatosensory cortex (SII). During single-cell recordings, animals performed an active touch task in which they rubbed their fingertips over pairs of gratings differing in groove width and indicated which was the smoother surface. Hand motion and downward applied force were measured and recorded during these strokes. 2. In this survey, 151 penetrations provided observations on 352 cells that responded to passive stimulation of the digits or during performance of the active touch task. Consistent with previous reports, receptive fields (RFs) in SII were large, often multidigit, and frequently included a portion or all of the hand and occasionally the arm. Modality was determined for 92 of 127 fully characterized cells, and included 70 cutaneous, 5 deep, 11 Pacinian corpuscle, and 6 joint cells. Characteristic of SII, modality could not be defined in 35 cells that were unresponsive to passive stimulation or whose responses varied widely over time. 3. Response properties of a subgroup of 79 cells in SII resembled those previously studied in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) using identical procedures. Correlation analysis revealed that 29 of these cells, like a portion of cells in SI, responded to changes in groove width independent of force or velocity. This selectivity could be considered a form of feature specificity. 4. In contrast to SI and VPL, transient responses to the fingertips contacting small elevated metal bars, which demarcated the beginning, middle, and end of strokes across the gratings, were seen in a majority of SII cells (109/127). During contact with bars, 89 cells displayed excitatory responses and 20 cells showed suppressed activity. Twelve cells, which responded to bars in isolation from gratings, provided a possible example of increased stimulus selectivity. 5. Passive stimulation failed to activate 16 cells that responded, in some cases differentially to gratings or force, during the task. Responses of nine other cells demonstrated task-dependent modulation in the form of response reduction or enhancement during selected portions of the stroke. In these same cells, response changes did not occur under comparable stimulus conditions in other portions of the stroke that differed only in behavioral context. These types of selective response modulations, not noted in our previous studies of VPL or SI, suggest that mechanisms regulating sensory inputs may affect SII. 6. Greater stimulus selectivity, larger RFs, loss of modality specificity, and selective modulation observed in SII are discussed in reference to the possibility that they characterize SII as being ''upstream'' in proposed somatosensory hierarchies.;WASHINGTON UNIV, SCH MED, DEPT ANAT & NEUROBIOL, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA;Washington University (WUSTL);;;;;"NIDCD NIH HHS [DC-00096] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS-31005] Funding Source: Medline";"NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;92;92;92;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

These fibers are composed of a dense plexus of thin beaded axons which ensheath an unstained central core. Such structures are not confined to the globus pallidus, but are also present in the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the hypothalamus, the dorsal part of the amygdala, and ventrally in the basal forebrain. The present study describes the relationship between projections from the rostral and ventral striatum and the enkephalin- and substance P-positive wooly fibers. Following injections of either tritiated amino acids or the lectin PHaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the ventral striatum, anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals in the forebraine were visualized simultaneously with enkephalin- or substance P immunoreactivity in the same tissue section in order to determine: (i) the extent to which the woolly fiber distribution represents striatal output systems; (ii) whether woolly fibers can be considered as a marker for the entire striatal forebrain projection; and (iii) whether enkephalin and substance P are involved differentially in distinct ventral striatopallidal pathways. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin labeling is seen in the globus pallidus and adjacent structures either as single, beaded fibers or in a profile strikingly similar to that of woolly fibers. In tissue sections treated for a double immunohistochemical protocol, following which the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin-immunoreactive fibers turn black and the peptidergic woolly fibers brown; many of the lectin-positive fibers are seen to enter the peptide-positive woolly fiber plexus. Likewise, following the injections with tritiated amino acids in the ventral striatum, coarse structures that have dimensions resembling those of the woolly fibers are identified. In sections immunohistochemically stained and subsequently treated for autoradiography, peptide-positive woolly fibers can be identified underlying the silver strains. In sections stained for both peptide immunoreactivity and tracer substances, enkephalin or substance P-positive woolly fibers are present in all pallidal regions that receive ventral striatal input. However, the ventral striatum also sends fibers to the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the dorsal part of the amygdala, the septum, the preoptic area, and other areas of the basal forebrain. In these nuclei the peptide-positive woolly fiber distribution is less extensive than the terminal labeling. The distribution of substance P-positive fibers in the subcommissural pallidal region is more limited than the distribution of enkephalinergic fibers. The distribution of substance P wooly fibers coincides well with the distribution of inputs from the most ventral striatal region including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen. These results suggest that enkephalin- and substance P-positive woolly fibers outside the pallidum appear to represent striatal efferent projections. However, these peptide-positive woolly fibers are not a marker for the full extent of the striatal projections. Finally, substance P immunoreactivity in the region beneath the anterior commissure arises from the most ventral portion of the ventral striatum, in particular the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen.";"UNIV ZURICH,INST ANAT,CH-8057 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND; FREE UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT ANAT & EMBRYOL,1007 MC AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS";"University of Zurich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam";HABER, SN (corresponding author), UNIV ROCHESTER,SCH MED,DEPT NEUROBIOL & ANAT,ROCHESTER,NY 14642, USA.;;Wolfer, David P/B-3293-2016;Wolfer, David P/0000-0002-5957-1401;"NIMH NIH HHS [MH45573-01] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHS [NS22511] Funding Source: Medline";"NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";;;40;39;41;0;0;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB;0306-4522;;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;;1990;39;2;;;;;323;338;;10.1016/0306-4522(90)90271-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(90)90271-5;;;16;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;EP132;1708114;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1990EP13200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, the projections from the pulvinar nucleus to the cortex are less clearly defined. The pulvinar projects predominantly to layer I in V1, and layer IV in extrastriate areas. These projection patterns suggest that the pulvinar nucleus most strongly influences (drives) activity in cortical areas beyond V1. Should this hypothesis be true, one would expect the spatiotemporal responses evoked by pulvinar activation to be different in V1 and extrastriate areas, reflecting the different connectivity patterns. We investigated this issue by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical visual areas' activity following thalamic electrical microstimulation in tree shrews, using optical imaging and voltage-sensitive dyes. As expected, electrical stimulation of the dLGN induced fast and local responses in V1, as well as in extrastriate and contralateral cortical areas. In contrast, electrical stimulation of the pulvinar induced fast and local responses in extrastriate areas, followed by weak and diffuse activation in V1 and contralateral cortical areas.

In slow-wave sleep, spindles (7-16 Hz) are a prominent spontaneous oscillation generated by thalamic circuits and triggered by cortical slow waves. In wakefulness and under anesthesia, brief peripheral sensory stimuli can evoke 10-Hz reverberations due potentially to similar thalamic mechanisms. Functionally, sleep spindles and peripherally evoked spindles may play a role in memory consolidation and perception, respectively. Yet, rarely have the circuits involved in these two rhythms been compared in the same animals and never in primates. Here, we investigated the entrainment of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons to both rhythms in ketamine-sedated macaques. First, we compared spontaneous spindles in sedation and natural sleep to validate the model. Then, we quantified entrainment with spike-field coherence and phase-locking statistics. We found that S1 neurons entrained to spontaneous sleep spindles were also entrained to the evoked spindles, although entrainment strength and phase systematically differed. Our results indicate that the spindle oscillations triggered by top-down spontaneous cortical activity and bottom-up peripheral input share a common cortical substrate. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Brief sensory stimuli evoke 10-Hz oscillations in thalamocortical neuronal activity and in perceptual thresholds. The mechanisms underlying this evoked rhythm are not well understood but are thought to be similar to those generating sleep spindles. We directly compared the entrainment of cortical neurons to both spontaneous spindles and peripherally evoked oscillations in sedated monkeys. We found that the entrainment strengths to each rhythm were positively correlated, although with differing entrainment phases, implying involvement of similar networks.;"[Sritharan, Srihari Y.; Contreras-Hernandez, Enrique; Richardson, Andrew G.; Lucas, Timothy H.] Univ Penn, Ctr Neuroengn & Therapeut, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";"University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine";Richardson, AG (corresponding author), Univ Penn, 175A Stemmler Mall,3450 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;andrew.richardson@pennmedicine.upenn.edu;Richardson, Andrew G./AAI-1645-2020;Richardson, Andrew G./0000-0002-4752-3867;National Science Foundation [CBET-1404041];National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF));This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant CBET-1404041.;;66;5;5;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

We further analyzed this structural functional relationship by comparing the developmental pattern of TNAP activity to the maturation of the thalamocortical afferents in the primate brain (Callithrix jacchus). Cortical expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity reflects the sequential maturation of the modality-specific sensory areas. Within the visual cortex, the regional and laminar distribution of AP correlates with the differential maturation of the magno- and parvocellular streams. AP activity, which is transiently expressed in the white matter, exhibits a complementary distributional pattern with myelin staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that AP activity is localized exclusively to the myelin-free axonal segments, including the node of Ranvier. It was also found that AP activity is gradually expressed in parallel with the maturation of synaptic contacts in them neuropile. These data suggest the involvement of AP, in addition to neurotransmitter synthesis previously suggested in the adult, in synaptic stabilization and in myelin pattern formation and put forward a role of AP in cortical plasticity and brain disorders.

We examined vestibular input to the periarcuate cortex in the Japanese monkey by analyzing laminar field potentials evoked by electrical Stimulation of the vestibular nerve. Laminar field potential analysis in the depths of the cerebral cortex showed that vestibular-evoked potentials consisted of early-positive and late-negative potentials and early-negative and late-positive potentials in the superficial and deep layers of the periarcuate cortex. respectively. with latencies of 4.8-6.3 ms, Suggesting that these potentials were directly conveyed to the cortex through the thalamus. These potentials were distributed continuously in the fundus, dorsal and ventral banks of the spur and the bottom of the junctional part of the arcuate sulcus and spur. This vestibular-projecting area overlapped the cortical distribution of corticovestibular neurons that were retrogradely labeled by tracer injection into the vestibular nuclei (previously reported area 6pa), and also the distribution of smooth pursuit-related neurons recorded in the periarcuate cortex including area 8 in a trained monkey. These results are discussed in relation to the function of vestibular information in control of smooth pursuit and efferents of the smooth pursuit-related frontal eye field.

Results from an increasing number of studies across sensory systems and different species reveal effects of feedback both on the receptive fields of thalamic neurons and on the transmission of sensory information between the thalamus and cortex. Importantly, these studies demonstrate that the corticothalamic projection cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be considered as an integral part of a thalamo-corticothalamic circuit which intimately interconnects the thalamus and cortex for sensory processing.;"[Briggs, Farran; Usrey, W.

Given the high prevalence of pain in diabetic patients and crosstalk between chemokines and opioids, it is pivotal to know whether neuroinfiammation-associated mediators are dysregulated in the central nervous system of diabetic primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether mRNA expression levels of glial markers, chemokines, and opioid receptors are altered in the spinal cord and thalamus of naturally occurring type 2 diabetic monkeys (n = 7) compared with age-matched non-diabetic monkeys (n = 6). By using RT-qPCR, we found that mRNA expression levels of both GFAP and IBA1 were up-regulated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of diabetic monkeys compared with non-diabetic monkeys. Among all chemokines, expression levels of three chemokine ligand-receptor systems, i.e., CCL2-CCR2, CCL3-CCR1/5, and CCL4-CCR5, were up-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys. Moreover, in the SDH, seven additional chemokine receptors, i.e., CCR4, CCR6, CCR8, CCR10, CXCR3, CXCR5, and CXCR6, were also up-regulated in diabetic monkeys. In contrast, expression levels of MOP, KOP, and DOP, but not NOP receptors, were down-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys, and the thalamus had fewer changes in the glial markers, chemokines and opioids. These findings indicate that neuroin-fiammation, manifested as glial activation and simultaneous up-regulation of multiple chemokine ligands and receptors, seems to be permanent in type 2 diabetic monkeys. As chemokines and opioids are important pain modulators, this first-in-primate study provides a translational bridge for determining the functional efficacy of spinal drugs targeting their signaling cascades.

Our specific goals were to assess the prevalence and the degree of orientation tuning in the monkey LGN and to determine if the preferred stimulus orientations of LGN neurons varied as a function of receptive-field position. The primary motivation for this research was to gain insight into the receptive-field configuration of LGN neurons and consequently into the neural mechanisms which determine the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields in primates. In both the parvocellular and magnocellular layers, the responses of the majority of individual neurons to sine-wave gratings varied as a function of stimulus orientation. The influence of stimulus orientation was, however, highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the stimulus; the greatest degree of orientation bias was observed for spatial frequencies higher than the cell's optimal spatial frequency. On a population basis, the degree of orientation bias was similar for all major classes of LGN neurons (e.g. ON vs. OFF center; parvocellular vs. magnocellular) and did not vary systematically with receptive-field eccentricity. At a given receptive-field location, LGN neurons, particularly cells in the parvocellular laminae, tended to prefer either radially oriented stimuli or stimuli oriented more horizontally than their polar axis. Our analyses of the orientation-dependent changes in spatial-frequency response functions, which was based on the Soodak et al., (1987; Soodak, 1986) two-dimensional, difference-of-Gaussian receptive-field model, suggested that the orientation bias in LGN neurons was due to an elongation of the receptive-field center mechanism which in some cases appeared to consist of multiple subunits. Direct comparisons of the orientation-tuning characteristics of LGN cells and their retinal inputs (S potentials) indicated that the orientation bias in the monkey LGN reflects primarily the functional properties of individual retinal ganglion cells. We conclude that orientation sensitivity is a significant property of subcortical neurons in the primate's geniculo-cortical pathway.";;;SMITH, EL (corresponding author), UNIV HOUSTON,COLL OPT,4800 CALHOUN BLVD,HOUSTON,TX 77204, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [R01 EY-08128, P30 EY-07551, R01 EY-03611] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;79;81;82;0;3;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0952-5238;;;VISUAL NEUROSCI;Visual Neurosci.;DEC;1990;5;6;;;;;525;545;;10.1017/S0952523800000699;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952523800000699;;;21;"Neurosciences; Ophthalmology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Ophthalmology";ET862;2085469;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1990ET86200002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We report the development and evaluation of a putative antagonist, 5-(3'-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (nifrolidine) as a PET agent for nicotine alpha(4)beta(2) receptors. Methods: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine was measured in rat brain slices labeled with I-125-iodoepibatidine or I-125-bungaratoxin. Selectivity of binding was measured in the presence of cytisine. F-18 radiolabeling was performed by reacting the tosylate precursor with F-18-fluoride followed by cleprotection. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain slices with 5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (F-18-nifrolidine) were read on a phosphor imager. Rats were injected with F-18-nifrolidine (3.7 MBq each), and brain regions were counted at various times (2-120 min). Blocking studies were performed by subcutaneous injection of nicotine (10 mg/kg). A PET study of F-18-nifrolidine (approximately 148 MBq) was performed on an anesthetized rhesus monkey using a high-resolution scanner. Results: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine exhibited an inhibition constant of 2.89 nmol/L for the alpha(4)beta(2) sites. Radiosynthesis and high-performance liquid chromatography purifications yielded the product in approximately 20%-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield to provide 18F-nifrolidine specific activities of approximately 111-185 GBq/mumol. In vitro autoradiography in rat brain slices revealed selective binding of F-18-nifrolidine to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, ventral posteriomedial thalamus, dorsolateral geniculate, and, to a lesser extent, cortex and striata, which are known to contain alpha(4)beta(2) sites. This specific binding was completely abolished by 300 mumol/L nicotine. Ex vivo rat brain distribution studies indicated selective binding in the thalamus with a maximal thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. The PET study revealed selective maximal uptake (0.01 % injected dose/mL) in regions of the thalamus (anteroventral and anteromedial mus, ventrolateral thalamus) and extrathalamic regions such as cingulate gyrus, lateral geniculate, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. Conclusion: Binding of F-18-nifrolidine to alpha(4)beta(2) receptor-rich regions in rats and monkeys indicates promise as a PET agent. Additionally, the thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio approached a plateau of 1.7 in 120 min, indicating relatively faster kinetics compared with previously reported imaging agents.;"Univ Calif Irvine, Brain Imaging Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Kettering Med Ctr, Dept PET Nucl Med, Dayton, OH USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmacol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA";"University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine";Mukherjee, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Brain Imaging Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, 162 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;mukherjj@uci.edu;"Potkin, Steven G/A-2021-2013; Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/O-1320-2013";"Mukherjee, Jogeshwar/0000-0003-1009-877X; Potkin, Steven/0000-0003-1028-1013";NIDA NIH HHS [DA 13332] Funding Source: Medline;NIDA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA));;;34;26;26;0;3;SOC NUCLEAR MEDICINE INC;RESTON;1850 SAMUEL MORSE DR, RESTON, VA 20190-5316 USA;0161-5505;1535-5667;;J NUCL MED;J.

CPSP is hypothesized to be caused by maladaptive reorganization between various brain regions. The treatment for CPSP has not been established; however, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex has a clinical effect. To verify the functional reorganization hypothesis for CPSP development and rTMS therapeutic mechanism, we longitudinally pursued the structural and functional changes of the brain by using two male CPSP model monkeys (Macaca fuscata) developed by unilateral hemorrhage in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Application of rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex relieved the induced pain of the model monkeys. A tractography analysis revealed a decrease in the structural connectivity in the ipsilesional thalamocortical tract, and rTMS had no effect on the structural connectivity. A region of interest analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed inappropriately strengthened functional connectivity between the ipsilesional mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala, which are regions associated with emotion and memory, suggesting that this may be the cause of CPSP development.

However, it is unclear whether the same intervention would be effective for thermal hyperalgesia. Therefore, using the macaque model, we examined behavioural responses to thermal stimuli following pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII. Methods Two CPSP model macaques were established based on collagenase-induced unilateral hemorrhagic lesions in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. To evaluate pain perception, withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 37, 45, 50, 52, and 55 degrees C to hands were measured. Several weeks after the lesion induction, pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII by microinjection of muscimol was performed. The effect of inactivation on withdrawal latency was assessed by comparison with withdrawal latency after vehicle injection. Results Several weeks after induction of the thalamic lesions, both macaques demonstrated a reduction in withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation (<50 degrees C) on the contralesional hand, indicating the occurrence of thermal hyperalgesia. When the PIC/SII were inactivated by muscimol, the withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 50 and 52 degrees C were significantly increased compared to those after vehicle injection. Conclusions Our data emphasize that increased activity in the PIC/SII after appearance of thalamic lesions can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities, and the modulation of PIC/SII activity may be a therapeutic approach for thermal hyperalgesia. Significance CPSP is caused by stroke lesions in the sensory system and characterized by mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia. Inactivation of the PIC/SII has an analgesic effect on mechanical allodynia; however, it is not clear whether the same intervention could reduce thermal hyperalgesia. Here, using the macaque model, we demonstrated that inactivation of these cortices reduces hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli. This result emphasizes that increased PIC/SII activity can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities.";"[Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro; Matsuda, Keiji; Higo, Noriyuki] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Human Informat & Interact Res Inst, Tsukuba, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki; Takashima, Ichiro] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Niigata, Japan; [Nagasaka, Kazuaki] Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Dept Phys Therapy, Niigata, Japan";"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); University of Tsukuba; Niigata University; Niigata University";Nagasaka, K (corresponding author), Niigata Univ Hlth & Welf, Inst Human Movement & Med Sci, Kita Ku, 1398 Shimami Cho, Niigata 9503198, Japan.;nagasaka@nuhw.ac.jp;"Takashima, Ichiro/M-6105-2016; Matsuda, Keiji/N-2784-2016; Higo, Noriyuki/M-6385-2016";"Takashima, Ichiro/0000-0003-0272-5075; Matsuda, Keiji/0000-0003-2529-0019; Nagasaka, Kazuaki/0000-0002-1782-3316; Higo, Noriyuki/0000-0002-3448-1696";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [20H05490]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20K19389]";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)";"Y Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: 20H05490; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas, Grant/Award Number: 20K19389";;34;2;2;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1090-3801;1532-2149;;EUR J PAIN;Eur.

Not only were movements evoked from motor areas (PMC and M1), but they were also evoked from posterior parietal (5, 7a, 7b) and anterior parietal areas (3b, 1, 2). Large representations of digit movements involving only the index finger (D2) and thumb (D1), were elicited from areas 1, 2, 7b, and M1. Other movements evoked from these regions were similar to ethologically relevant movements that have been described in other primates. These include combined forelimb and mouth movements and full hand grasps. However, many other movements were much more complex and could not be categorized into any of the previously described ethological categories. Movements involving specific digits, which mimic precision grips, are unique to macaques and have not been described in New World or prosimian primates. We propose that these multiple and expanded motor representations of the digits co-evolved with the emergence of the opposable thumb and alterations in grip type in some anthropoid lineages.;"[Baldwin, Mary K.

A total of 203 neurons displaying movement-related changes in activity were examined in detail. Most of these cells (69%) showed an increase in firing rate in relation to the onset of movement and could be categorized according to whether they fired in the VT task exclusively, in the IG task exclusively, or in both tasks. The proportion of cells in each category was found to vary between each of the cerebellar-receiving [oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo) and area X] and basal-ganglia-receiving [oral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and parvocellular portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc)] nuclei that were examined. In particular, in area X the largest group of cells (52%) showed an increase in activity during the VT task only, whereas in VApc the largest group of cells (53%) fired in the IG task only. In contrast to this, relatively high degree of task specificity, in both VPLo and VLo the largest group of cells (similar to 55%) burst in relation to both tasks. Of the cells that were active in both tasks, a higher proportion were preferentially active in the VT task in VPLo and area X, and the IG task in VLo and VApc. In addition, cells in all four nuclei became active earlier relative to movement onset in the IG task compared with the VT task. These results demonstrate that functional distinctions do exist in the cerebellar- and basal-ganglia-receiving portions of the primate motor thalamus in relation to the types of cues used to initiate and control movement. These distinctions are most clear in area X and VApc, and are much less apparent in VPLo and VLo.;"Univ Oxford, Physiol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PT, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3PT, England";"University of Oxford; University of Oxford";van Donkelaar, P (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Exercise & Movement Sci, 2C Esslinger Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;;Miall, R.

The thalamus receives extensive feedback from the cortex and this influences the firing pattern, synchronization and sensory response mode of relay cells. A crucial question concerns the extent to which the feedback simply controls the state and transmission mode of relay cells and the extent to which the feedback participates in the specific processing of sensory information. Using examples from experiments examining the influence of feedback from the visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we argue that thalamic mechanisms are selectively focused by visually driven feedback to optimize the thalamic contribution to segmentation and global integration. This involves effects on both the temporal and spatial parameters characterizing the responses of LGN cells and includes, for example, motion-driven feedback effects from MT (middle temporal visual area) relayed via layer 6 of V1 (primary visual cortex).;UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, Dept Vis Sci, London EC1V 9EL, England;"University of London; University College London";Sillito, AM (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, Dept Vis Sci, 11-43 Bath St, London EC1V 9EL, England.;a.sillito@ucl.ac.uk;;;;;;;64;130;135;0;13;ROYAL SOC;LONDON;6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND;0962-8436;;;PHILOS T R SOC B;Philos.

Because nerve fibers reflect local skin deformations, they individually carry ambiguous signals about object features. In contrast, cortical neurons exhibit heterogeneous response properties that reflect computations applied to convergent input from multiple classes of afferents, which confer to them a selectivity for behaviorally relevant features of objects. The conventional view is that these complex response properties arise within the cortex itself, implying that sensory signals are not processed to any significant extent in the two intervening structures-the cuneate nucleus (CN) and the thalamus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the responses evoked in the CN to a battery of stimuli that have been extensively used to characterize tactile coding in both the periphery and cortex, including skin indentations, vibrations, random dot patterns, and scanned edges. We found that CN responses are more similar to their cortical counterparts than they are to their inputs: CN neurons receive input from multiple classes of nerve fibers, they have spatially complex receptive fields, and they exhibit selectivity for object features. Contrary to consensus, then, the CN plays a key role in processing tactile information.;"[Suresh, Aneesha K.; He, Qinpu; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Computat Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Greenspon, Charles M.; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rosenow, Joshua M.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Miller, Lee E.] Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Grossman Inst Neurosci Quantitat Biol & Human Beh, Chicago, IL 60637 USA";"University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University; Shirley Ryan AbilityLab; University of Chicago";"Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Computat Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Grossman Inst Neurosci Quantitat Biol & Human Beh, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.";sliman@uchicago.edu;;"He, Qinpu/0000-0003-1669-7570; Greenspon, Charles M./0000-0002-6806-3302; Bensmaia, Sliman/0000-0003-4039-9135";National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS122333, NS095162, NS096952];National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));We thank Amit Ayer for help with the surgical procedures.

Nuclei involved in representation and regulation of the organism's internal state contain CB, whereas those involved in the representation of the external environment and the representation or execution of externally directed actions contain only PV. Moreover, our findings indicate that different nuclei known as components of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) contain either CB or PV or both, suggesting that this system in primates operates with both CB and PV. In line with previously reported findings, we also found that unmyelinated pathways contain only CB, whereas myelinated pathways contain PV. Distribution of CB and PV in the macaque brainstem follows a pattern comparable to, but in some instances significantly different than, the pattern previously reported in the rat. We argue that the nonoverlapping distribution of CB and PV among different structures of the brainstem might reflect underlying differences in the physiological, anatomic, and perhaps phylogenetic properties of these structures. Considering our recent findings of selective vulnerability of brainstem structures to Alzheimer's disease, the present data suggest that the majority of macaque brainstem nuclei that contain CB are vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangles in humans. By contrast, only few nuclei that contain PV exhibit pathologic changes. Some of these nuclei are affected with a high number of neuritic plaques without ever developing neurofibrillary tangles.;Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Div Cognit Neurosci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA;University of Iowa;Parvizi, J (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Div Cognit Neurosci, 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;josef-parvizi@uiowa.edu;Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019;;;;;;68;17;18;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

According to the classical view, orientation tuning arises from the integration of untuned input from thalamic neurons with aligned but spatially displaced receptive fields (RFs). In a recent microneurography study with human subjects, the precise temporal structure of the responses of individual mechanoreceptive afferents to scanned edges was found to carry information about their orientation. This putative mechanism could in principle contribute to or complement the classical rate-based code for orientation. In the present study, we further examine orientation information carried by mechanoreceptive afferents of Rhesus monkeys. To this end, we record the activity evoked in cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents when edges are indented into or scanned across the skin. First, we confirm that information about the edge orientation can be extracted from the temporal patterning in afferent responses of monkeys, as is the case in humans. Second, we find that while the coarse temporal profile of the response can be predicted linearly from the layout of the RF, the fine temporal profile cannot. Finally, we show that orientation signals in tactile afferents are often highly dependent on stimulus features other than orientation, which complicates putative decoding strategies. We discuss the challenges associated with establishing a neural code at the somatosensory periphery, where afferents are exquisitely sensitive and nearly deterministic.;"[Suresh, Aneesha K.; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Computat Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Saal, Hannes P.; Bensmaia, Sliman J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, 1025 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA";"University of Chicago; University of Chicago";Bensmaia, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, 1027 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;sliman@uchicago.edu;;"Suresh, Aneesha/0000-0002-1014-9541; Saal, Hannes/0000-0002-7544-0196";"National Science Foundation [IOS 1150209]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS-096952 (F31)]";"National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant IOS 1150209 and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant NS-096952 (F31).;;37;14;14;0;4;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA;0022-3077;1522-1598;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

It has been disputed whether visual experience is necessary for the formation of ocular dominance columns. To settle this issue, fetal monkeys were delivered prematurely by Caesarean section at embryonic day 157 (E157), 8 d before the end of normal gestation, To avoid light exposure, the Caesarean section and all subsequent feedings and procedures were done in absolute darkness, using infrared night-vision goggles. Tritiated proline was injected into the right eye 1 d after delivery (E158). One week later at postnatal age 0 (P0), the equivalent of a full-term pregnancy (E165/P0), alternate sections of unfolded and flattened visual cortex were prepared for autoradiography or cytochrome oxidase (CO). All three newborns studied at E165/P0 had well segregated ocular dominance columns organized into the characteristic mosaic present in adults. In the upper layers, a mature pattern of CO patches (also known as blobs or puffs) was visible, aligned with the ocular dominance columns in layer IVc. Every other row of patches in layers II,III was labeled by [H-3]proline, In V2, a distinct system of alternating thick-pale-thin-pale CO stripes was present. These findings indicate that stimulation of the retina by light is not necessary for the development of columnar systems in the visual cortex. Ocular dominance columns, patches, and V2 stripes all are well formed before visual experience, Even the thalamic input to the patches in the upper layers of striate cortex is segregated by eye in newborns.;;;Horton, JC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO,BECKMAN VIS CTR,10 KIRKHAM ST,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94143, USA.;;;Horton, Jonathan/0000-0002-3952-435X;"NCRR NIH HHS [RR00169] Funding Source: Medline; NEI NIH HHS [R01-EY10217] Funding Source: Medline";"NCRR NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))";;;44;212;213;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

In controls, cholinergic innervation of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus was distributed heterogeneously in densely labelled patches surrounded by less heavily stained matrix. In patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, the density of choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 75% in the matrix and 60% in the patches. The number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cell bodies decreased by 84% in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, but more moderately (-33%) in the substantia innominata. In patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type, choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 34% in the matrix, but 46% in the patches. Choline acetyltransferase-labelled cell bodies were spared in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, whereas severe loss (-80%) was observed in the substantia innominata. These results suggest that cholinergic innervation of mediodorsal nucleus matrix derives mainly from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and mediodorsal nucleus patches from the substantia innominata. Differential loss of innervation to the matrix and patches in progressive supranuclear palsy and senile dementia of Alzheimer type may in turn differentially affect mediodorsal nucleus innervation of the frontal cortex, resulting in dissimilar symptomatologies.;HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, LAB NEUROPATHOL R ESCOUROLLE, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE;"Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Charles-Foix - APHP; Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Hopital Universitaire Armand-Trousseau - APHP";BRANDEL, JP (corresponding author), HOP LA PITIE SALPETRIERE, INSERM, U289, MED EXPTL LAB, 47 BD HOP, F-75651 PARIS 13, FRANCE.;;Hirsch, Etienne/AAC-7655-2019;Hirsch, Etienne/0000-0003-4823-276X;;;;;37;51;51;0;0;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0306-4522;1873-7544;;NEUROSCIENCE;Neuroscience;;1991;41;1;;;;;25;31;;10.1016/0306-4522(91)90197-V;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(91)90197-V;;;7;Neurosciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Neurosciences & Neurology;FH564;2057062;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991FH56400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Restricted areas of the lateral and posterior orbital cortex had specific connections with visual-, somatosensory-, olfactory-, gustatory-, and visceral-related structures. More medial areas received few direct sensory inputs. Within the lateral and posterior orbital cortex, area 12l received a substantial projection from visual areas in the inferior temporal cortex (TE). Area 12m received somatosensory input from face, digit, or forelimb regions in the opercular part of area 1-2, in area 7b, in the second somatosensory area (SII), and in the anterior infraparietal area (AIP). Areas 13m and 13l also received a projection from the opercular part of areas 1-2 and 3b. The posteromedial and lateral agranular insular areas (Iapm and Ial, respectively) received fibers from the ventral part of the parvicellular division of the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) that may represent a visceral afferent system. The dorsal part of VPMpc projected to the adjacent gustatory cortex. These restricted inputs from several sensory modalities and the convergent corticocortical connections to orbital areas 13l and 13m suggest a network related to feeding. The OMPFC was also connected to premotor cortex in ventral area 6 (areas 6va and 6vb), in cingulate area 24c, and probably in the supplementary eye field. Area 6va projected to area 12m, whereas a region of area 6vb projected to area 13l. The region of the supplementary eye field projected to areas 12l, 12o, and 12r. Area Ial received fibers from area 24c. Lighter and more diffuse projections also reached wider areas of the OMPFC. For example, injections in several orbital areas labeled a few cells scattered through the anterior part of area TE and the superior temporal gyrus. There was also a projection to the intermediate agranular insular area (Iai) and to areas 13a and 12o from the apparently multimodal areas in the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus.

However, the postnatal development of the amygdala is not easily explored at the cellular level in humans. Here we performed a stereological analysis of the macaque monkey amygdala in order to characterize the cellular changes underlying its normal structural development in primates. The lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei exhibited the same developmental pattern, with a large increase in volume between birth and 3 months of age, followed by slower growth continuing beyond 1 year of age. In contrast, the medial nucleus was near adult size at birth. At birth, the volume of the central nucleus was half of the adult value; this nucleus exhibited significant growth even after 1 year of age. Neither neuronal soma size, nor neuron or astrocyte numbers changed during postnatal development. In contrast, oligodendrocyte numbers increased substantially, in parallel with an increase in amygdala volume, after 3 months of age. At birth, the paralaminar nucleus contained a large pool of immature neurons that gradually developed into mature neurons, leading to a late increase in the volume of this nucleus. Our findings revealed that distinct amygdala nuclei exhibit different developmental profiles and that the amygdala is not fully mature for some time postnatally. We identified different periods during which pathogenic factors might lead to the abnormal development of distinct amygdala circuits, which may contribute to different human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with alterations of amygdala structure and functions.

However, the effect of fetal irradiation on cognitive functions that are vulnerable in schizophrenia (e.g., working memory) has not been examined. Methods: Four fetally irradiated macaque monkeys (FIMs) and four age-matched controls (CONs) were tested as juveniles (12-30 months) and again as adults (similar to 5 years) on delayed spatial response (DR), a working memory task that is dependent on intact prefrontal cortical circuitry. Results: As juveniles, seven of eight monkeys learned DR; one FIM refused to test. Performance in the two groups was not different. As adults, only one FIM achieved criterion on DR. Three of four FIMs did not reach criterion at the 0-sec delay interval of the DR task, whereas all four CONs mastered DR at the maximum tested delay of 10 sec. FIMs completed fewer DR test sessions compared with CONs. In contrast, all FIMs and three of four CONs learned an associative memory task, visual pattern discrimination.

Although many anatomical and physiological studies suggest a role for the PPTN in the control of conditioned behavior and associative learning, the detailed characteristics of saccade- and visual-related activities of PPTN neurons remain unclear. We recorded the activity of PPTN neurons in monkeys (Macaca fuscata ) during visually guided saccade tasks, and examined the response properties of saccade- and visual-related activities such as time course, direction selectivity and contextual modulation. Saccade-related activity occurred either during saccade execution or after saccade end. The preferred directions of the neuronal activity were biased toward the contralateral and upward sides. Half of the saccade-related neurons showed activity modulation only for task saccades and not for spontaneous saccades outside the task. Visually-responsive neurons responded with short latencies. Some responded to the appearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally selective manner, and others responded to both the appearance and disappearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally non-selective manner. Many of these neurons exhibited distinct visual responses to the appearance of two different stimuli presented under different stages of the task, whereas a population of the neurons responded equally to the disappearance of the two stimuli. Thus, many PPTN neurons exhibited context-dependent activity related to the visuomotor events, consistent with a role in controlling conditioned behavior.;"[Okada, Ken-Ichi; Kobayashi, Yasushi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Toyonaka, Osaka 560853, Japan; [Kobayashi, Yasushi] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 444, Japan; [Kobayashi, Yasushi] ATR Computat Neurosci Labs, Seika, Kyoto, Japan; [Kobayashi, Yasushi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Saitama, Japan";"Osaka University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)";Kobayashi, Y (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, 1-3 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 560853, Japan.;yasushi@fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp;Okada, Ken-ichi/IVH-5415-2023;"Okada, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-6377-1860; Kobayashi, Yasushi/0000-0002-2690-6527";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [854029, 17022027, 18020019, 20033013, 20300139]; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17022027, 20033013, 20300139, 18020019] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Science and Technology Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This study was supported by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology grants 854029, 17022027, 18020019, 20033013 and 20300139, and was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency PRESTO program.

Injection of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) into primary visual cortex labelled a band of CT fibres in the LP with terminal field confined to its lateral division ''LP1'', PHAL-labelled CT axons in the LP1 gave rise to both en passant and terminal boutons. They usually established several synaptic contacts - often in complex glomerulus-like synaptic arrangements - with dendritic shafts of large diameter and presynaptic dendrites containing pleomorphic vesicles. Postsynaptic targets of the PHAL-labelled CT boutons were characterized by postembedding gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry. It appeared that, in the LP1 of the cat, almost half (44.5%) of the postsynaptic dendrites to CT boutons from area 17 belonged to the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and the majority (41%) of these GABA-immunopositive dendrites were F2 terminals.

Here, we extend this work by estimating the time course of fMRI signal changes in the cortical and subcortical regions found to exhibit evidence for task-related activation. Our results indicate that there are separate loci of signal changes in the thalamus (dorsomedial and pulvinar) that exhibit notable differences in times of onset, peak and return to baseline of signal changes. The signal changes in the pulvinar demonstrate the slowest transients of all the cortical and subcortical regions we examined. Evaluation of cortical regions demonstrated salient differences as well, with the signal changes in Brodmann area 6 (BA6) rising, peaking, and returning to baseline earlier than those detected in other regions. We conclude that BA6 mediates early designation or refinement of search criteria, and that the pulvinar may be involved in the binding of feature stimuli for an integrated object memory.;"Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Donald W Reynolds Ctr Aging, Dept Geriatr, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Donald W Reynolds Ctr Aging, Dept Neurol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Donald W Reynolds Ctr Aging, Dept Radiol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; Tulane Univ, Neurosci Program, Dept Struct & Cellular Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Div Neuroradiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA";"University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; Tulane University; Yale University; Johns Hopkins University";Hart, J (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Donald W Reynolds Ctr Aging, Dept Geriatr, Slot 810,4301 W Markham St, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.;;Calhoun, Vince D./ACN-9399-2022;"Calhoun, Vince D./0000-0001-9058-0747; Hart, John/0000-0003-3919-8125";;;;;50;47;48;0;6;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA;1355-6177;;;J INT NEUROPSYCH SOC;J.

Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.;"[Bakken, Trygve E.; van Velthoven, Cindy T.

We selected the macaque monkey neocortex because of its clear areal subdivisions, large surface area, protracted development (gestation = 165 d), and similarity to the human brain. In situ hybridizations, performed at early [embryonic day 65 (E65)], middle (E80), and late (E95) stages of cortical development, revealed that EphA system family members are expressed in distinct gradients and laminar and areal domains in the embryonic neocortex. Indeed, several regionally restricted molecular patterns are already apparent within the cortical plate at E65, before the formation of thalamocortical connections, suggesting that the initial expression of some EphA system members is regulated by programs intrinsic to cortical cells. For example, EphA3, EphA6, and EphA7 are all selectively expressed within the presumptive visual cortex. However, although EphA6 and EphA7 are present throughout this region, EphA3 is only expressed in the prospective extrastriate cortex, suggesting that cortical cells harbor functional biases that may influence the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. Although several patterns of early gene expression are stable (e.g., EphA3, EphA4, and EphA6), others change as development proceeds (e.g., EphA5, EphA7, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5), perhaps responding to extrinsic cues. Thus, at E95, after connections between the cortical plate and thalamus have formed, receptor subtypes EphA3, EphA5, EphA6, and EphA7 and the ligand ephrin-A5 are expressed in posterior regions, whereas EphA4 and ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3 are either uniformly distributed or anteriorly biased.

However, the neuromechanism underlying the effects of ephedrine addiction still remains unclear. Our study aimed to establish chronic ephedrine addiction models in rhesus monkeys and to investigate the neuromechanism of chronic ephedrine addiction using the behavioural methods combined with resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent-functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). Monkeys in the ephedrine addiction group (n = 6) received intramuscular injections of ephedrine using a dose escalation method, with a chronic model established in 8 weeks, while in the control group (n = 4), monkeys received a pure 0.9% saline injection. The weight and behaviors of the monkeys were observed throughout the treatment. All monkeys underwent the brain MR scans for two times (before treatment and after treatment had been discontinued). After molding, the weight of the ephedrine group was significantly reduced, while the weight of the control group increased significantly. Compared with the control group, the ephedrine addicted monkeys showed more abnormal behaviors related to addiction. In fMRI study, the ephedrine addicted monkeys showed more increased brain activation than that of the control group, mainly including the prefrontal cortex(PFC) and anterior cin-gulate cortex (ACC), the left ventral tegmental area(VTA), right insula, right amygdala, hippocampus, left thalamus, and left cerebellum.We hypothesize that the principal neuromechanism underlying chronic ephedrine addiction involves multiple abnormal brain neuron circuits, mainly in the PFC and the limbic system, and is closely related to addictive behaviors.;"[Xie, Lei; Huang, Jinzhuang; Guo, Ruiwei; Sun, Zongbo; Wu, Beibei; Lin, Zhirong; Xiao, Yifeng; Ma, Shuhua] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, 57 Changping Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Lei; Huang, Jinzhuang; Guo, Ruiwei; Wang, Jinhong; Sun, Zongbo; Wu, Beibei; Ma, Shuhua] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, 22 Xinling Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ye] Michigan State Univ, Dept Linguist & Languages, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Xie, Lei; Huang, Jinzhuang; Guo, Ruiwei; Sun, Zongbo; Wu, Beibei; Ma, Shuhua] Guangdong Key Lab Med Mol Imaging, 57 Changping Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinhong] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Ultrasound, 57 Changping Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Duan, Shouxing] Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Pediat Surg, 69 Dongxiabei Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China";"Shantou University; Shantou University; Michigan State University; Shantou University; Shantou University";Ma, SH (corresponding author), Shantou Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, 57 Changping Rd, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;shuhua6633@163.com;"duan, shouxing/HMV-4168-2023; Lin, ZhiRong/K-2504-2013";duan, shouxing/0000-0002-3539-6741;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81774395, 81373745, 81072905]; Science and the Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China [017A020215060, 2009B030801323, 2010B031600023]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [S2011010005019, 10151503102000015]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and the Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)";"This study was funded by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants nos. 81774395, 81373745, and 81072905); Science and the Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China (Grants nos. 017A020215060, 2009B030801323, and 2010B031600023); the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grants nos.

Each of these tracers share the common features of high affinity for mGluR5 (0.08-0.23 nM vs. rat mGluR5) and moderate lipophilicity (log P 2.8-3.4). Compound 1b was synthesized using a Suzuki or Stille coupling reaction with [C-11]MeI. Compounds 2b and 3b were synthesized by a SNAr reaction using a 3-chlorobenzonitrile precursor. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus monkey brain slices using 2b and 3b showed specific binding in cortex, caudate, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, most thalamic nuclei, and lower binding in the cerebellum. PET imaging studies in monkey showed that all three tracers readily enter the brain and provide an mGluR5-specific signal in all gray matter regions, including the cerebellum. The specific signal observed in the cerebellum was confirmed by the autoradiographic studies and saturation binding experiments that showed tracer binding in the cerebellum of rhesus monkeys. In vitro metabolism studies using the unlabeled compounds showed that 1a, 2a, and 3a are metabolized slower by human liver microsomes than by monkey liver microsomes.

The 3 models use, respectively, a fully implemented computer neural network, a mathematical formulation of interactions in a descriptive model of anatomical circuitry and a purely descriptive account of circuitry that could underlie particular functions. The Ist 2 models involve as part of their design an interpolation principle where afferents of opposite physiological property establish spatially offset but adjacent terminal fields and the postsynaptic neurons' dendrites have a continuum of different degrees of overlap into the 2 afferent pools and therefore different synaptic weights from the 2 afferents; this creates a functional and spatial gradient of response properties in the postsynaptic neurons between the properties of the different sets of afferents. The 3rd model examines lateral excitatory and inhibitory interactions in such gradients. Model 1 addresses the transformation of distinct thalamic axon properties to a gradient of response properties in postsynaptic spiny stellate neurons in layer 4C of V1. Model 2 proposes circuitry producing orientation specificity in V1 that begins by generating specificity of responses to orthogonal orientations; this is achieved by means of orthogonally oriented lateral axon projections made by the layer 4C spiny stellate neurons; this is followed by generation of a full cycle of orientation specificities by means of pyramidal neuron dendritic overlap across spatially separated fields of spiny stellate neuron axons responding preferentially to orthogonal orientations. Model 3 describes a circuitry to explain inhibitory and facilitatory interactions observed to occur in single unit responses when the classical receptive field is stimulated concurrently with the surround region.

Comp. Neurol. 477:119-148). Microelectrode recordings from clusters of selectively thermoreceptive or nociceptive neurons were used to guide precise microinjections of various tracers in VMpo. A prior report (Craig and Zhang [2006] J. Comp. Neurol. 499:953-964) described retrograde tracing results, which confirmed the selective lamina I input to VMpo and the anteroposterior (head to foot) topography. The present report describes the results of microinjections of anterograde tracers placed at different levels in VMpo, based on the anteroposterior topographic organization of selectively nociceptive units and clusters over nearly the entire extent of VMpo. Each injection produced dense, patchy terminal labeling in a single coherent field within a distinct granular cortical area centered in the fundus of the superior limiting sulcus. The terminations were distributed with a consistent anteroposterior topography over the posterior half of the superior limiting sulcus. These observations demonstrate a specific VMpo projection area in dorsal posterior insular cortex that provides the basis for a somatotopic representation of selectively nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic activity.

Manual dexterity, of great evolutionary significance to the primates, ranges in complexity from the precise opposition of finger and thumb to Brendal playing Mozart. All dexterity depends on a sustained and rapid transfer of sensorimotor information between the cerebral cortex and the cervical spinal cord. 2. Multiple separate corticospinal neuron populations originate from cortical areas four, the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, postarcuate, parietal and insular cortex. Each corticospinal neuron population projects in parallel to all spinal segments, and has a distinctive pattern of terminations. 3. Each corticospinal neuron population has a unique thalamic input which can relay particular sensorimotor information from the sense organs, cerebellum and basal ganglia. The overall structural framework of these sensorimotor pathways, with many parallel corticospinal channels, with interconnections in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord to enable crosstalk between the channels, is that needed for parallel distributed processing, which would enable the very rapid transfer of information between the cerebral cortex and spinal cord needed for any sophisticated use of the hand. 4. Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord in the macaque results in an immediate hemiplegia, with subsequent remarkable although incomplete recovery of hand and finger movements. The only direct corticospinal input to the hemicord caudal to the hemisection, even after 3 years, is the similar to 10% of flbres which cross the midline caudal to the lesion: the fibres 'spared' by the hemisection, A matching 'sparing' of somatosensory input from the paresed limb also occurs. No regeneration of the interrupted pathways has been visualized using modern tracer techniques. 5. Cervical hemisection permanently reduces the number of parallel channels which transmit information between cortex acid spinal cord, but does not reduce their cortical origins nor the neuron populations targeted in the spinal cord. We infer that the content of the information that can be transmitted between the cortex and spinal cord is not greatly changed, but the rate of transmission of this information is sharply reduced, and is the 'bottleneck' that limits the complete recovery of dexterity following hemisection. The remarkable recovery that does occur presumably reflects more economic transmission of information by the few spared channels. We guess that this involves substantial synaptic reorganization not visualized by the procedures we have used.;UNIV MELBOURNE, HOWARD FLOREY INST EXPT PHYSIOL & MED, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA;"Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; University of Melbourne";DarianSmith, I (corresponding author), UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT ANAT & CELL BIOL, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA.;;Galea, Mary/F-4242-2010;"Galea, Mary/0000-0003-0045-7978; Darian-Smith, Corinna/0000-0002-4753-4574";;;;;33;20;20;0;0;WILEY-BLACKWELL;MALDEN;COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA;0305-1870;;;CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P;Clin.

At 3 days after rabies injections into proximal forelimb, distal forelimb and hindlimb representations of the macaque MI, second-order neurons via the thalamus were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei, including the dentate (DN), anterior interpositus (AIN) and posterior interpositus nuclei. In the DN, the labeling of both the forelimb and hindlimb was seen mainly in the dorsal aspect. The labeling of the hindlimb was located rostral to that of the forelimb and the labeling of the proximal forelimb was located slightly rostral to that of the distal forelimb. The same rostrocaudal arrangement was observed in the AIN. In the posterior interpositus nucleus, however, labeling from the MI hindlimb and forelimb representations largely overlapped. At the 4-day postinjection period, third-order labeling occurred in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar hemisphere. The Purkinje cell labeling from the forelimb representation, including the proximal and distal regions, was observed primarily in lobules IV-VI and crus I. The proximal forelimb labeling was both rostral and lateral to that of the distal forelimb within lobules IV-VI. However, the hindlimb labeling was seen both rostral and lateral to that of the proximal forelimb within lobules III-VI. These results indicate that the hindlimb, proximal forelimb and distal forelimb are arranged rostrocaudally in the DN and AIN, whereas there is dual somatotopy along the rostrocaudal and lateromedial axes in the cerebellar cortex.;"Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138421, Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Neurosci, Tokyo Metropolitan Org Med Res, Dept Syst Neurosci, Fuchu, Tokyo 183, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan; Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Dept Behav & Brain Sci, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan; Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Syst Neurophysiol, Okazaki, Aichi 444, Japan";"Juntendo University; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience; Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Kyoto University; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS)";Lu, XF (corresponding author), Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Bunkyo Ku, 2-1-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.;riku@med.juntendo.ac.jp;;Nambu, Atsushi/0000-0003-2153-5445;;;;;41;55;58;1;15;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

We determined patterns of ipsilateral cortical connections of the parabelt region by placing injections of four to seven distinguishable tracers in each of five monkeys. Results were related to architectonic subdivisions of auditory cortex in brain sections cut parallel to the surface of artificially flattened cortex (four cases) or cut in the coronal plane (one case). An auditory core was clearly apparent in these sections as a 16- to 20-mm rostrocaudally elongated oval, several millimeters from the lip of the sulcus, that stained darkly for parvalbumin, myelin, and acetylcholinesterase. These features were most pronounced caudally in the cortex assigned to auditory area I, only slightly reduced in the rostral area, and most reduced in the narrower rostral extension we define as the rostrotemporal area. A narrow band of cortex surrounding the core stained more moderately for parvalbumin, acetylcholinesterase, and myelin. Two regions of the caudal belt, the caudomedial area, and the mediolateral area, stained more darkly, especially for parvalbumin. Rostromedial and medial rostrotemporal, regions of the medial belt stained more lightly for parvalbumin than the caudomedial area or the lateral belt. The parabelt region stained less darkly than the core and belt fields. Injections confined to the parabelt region labeled few neurons in the core, but large numbers in parts of the belt, the parabelt, and adjacent portions of the temporal lobe. Injections that encroached on the belt labeled large numbers of neurons in the core and helped define the width of the belt. Caudal injections in the parabelt labeled caudal portions of the belt, rostral injections labeled rostral portions, and both caudal and rostral injections labeled neurons in the rostromedial area of the medial belt. These observations support the concept of dividing the auditory cortex into core, belt, and parabelt; provide evidence for including the rostral area in the core; suggest the existence of as many as seven or eight belt fields; provide evidence for at least two subdivisions of the parabelt; and identify regions of the temporal lobe involved in auditory processing.

These two laminae receive input from different sets of thalamic afferents with different functional properties. The development of dendritic spine and dendritic branch populations on these neurons in experimental animals is compared to the same features on similar groups of neurons in a series of normal animals described in the preceding study (Lund and Holbach, '91). Three conditions of rearing were used to alter afferent driving from normal: complete darkness (with in some cases return to normal diurnal light-dark cycle), bilateral eye lid suture, and monocular eye lid suture. Some of the normal and dark-reared infant monkeys were examined behaviorally for visual capacity in an earlier study (Regal et al., '76). All conditions of abnormal afferent driving caused changes from the normal developmental patterns of spine and dendritic arbor growth in these first-order neurons of the cortex and each condition differed in the nature of change produced. Major findings of this study are: 1. Vigorous spine acquisition and dendritic growth occurs under all conditions of visual deprivation on alpha and beta neurons. Eventual spine and dendritic attrition occurs under at least conditions of bilateral or monocular lid suture to produce a rather constant adult morphology. We assume, therefore, that visually driven activity is a modulator or shaper of the developmental process for thalamic recipient neurons of visual cortex, rather than being an initiator, terminator, or driving force for their maturation. 2. An innate clock, whose nature is unknown but is apparently not driven by visual input, initiates and terminates a period of growth of the thalamic recipient neurons between birth and 30-32 weeks of age. 3. Factors controlling dendritic arbor growth and retraction are different from those controlling spine synapse addition or attrition. 4. Whereas the alpha and beta neurons normally show quite different early growth patterns between birth and 30 weeks of age, when both eyes are simultaneously deprived of vision, an early temporal and numerical convergence occurs in patterns of spine population development on the two groups of neurons. This convergent pattern assumes a different form in dark-reared and lid-sutured animals. This suggests that the different patterns of development normally seen in the alpha and beta neurons depend on receiving different patterns of afferent driving, not on innate differences between alpha and beta neurons or links to different afferent axon populations independent of activity patterns. 5. Monocular suture was found to affect aspects of spine acquisition and dendritic growth of layer 4C neurons after 30 weeks of age. This may be due to a lack of development of layer 4C synaptic connections normally supporting binocular interactions in more superficial layers.;;;LUND, JS (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH,DEPT PSYCHIAT & NEUROBIOL ANAT & CELL SCI,336C SCAIFE HALL,PITTSBURGH,PA 15261, USA.;;;;NEI NIH HHS [EY05282, EY01086] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;37;42;42;0;1;WILEY-LISS;NEW YORK;DIV JOHN WILEY & SONS INC 605 THIRD AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10158-0012;0021-9967;;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

Understanding the principles of neuroanatomical organization in these structures is critical to understanding the functions they perform and ultimately how the human brain works. We have manually distilled and synthesized hundreds of primate neuroanatomy facts into a single interactive visualization. The resulting picture represents the fundamental neuroanatomical blueprint upon which cognitive functions must be implemented. Within this framework we hypothesize and detail 7 functional circuits corresponding to psychological perspectives on the brain: consolidated long-term declarative memory, short-term declarative memory, working memory/information processing, behavioral memory selection, behavioral memory output, cognitive control, and cortical information flow regulation. Each circuit is described in terms of distinguishable neuronal groups including the cerebral isocortex (9 pyramidal neuronal groups), parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, thalamus (4 neuronal groups), basal ganglia (7 neuronal groups), metencephalon, basal forebrain, and other subcortical nuclei. We focus on neuroanatomy related to primate nonprimary cortical systems to elucidate the basis underlying the distinct homotypical cognitive architecture. To display the breadth of this review, we introduce a novel method of integrating and presenting data in multiple independent visualizations: an interactive website (http://www.frontiersin.org/files/cognitiveconsilience/index.html) and standalone iPhone and iPad applications.

The spinothalamic tract (STT) is an integral pathway in the transmission of nociceptive information to the brain, yet the stage of development when axons from cells in the spinal cord reach the thalamus is unknown. Therefore, the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold was used to characterize the STT at several stages of development in the mouse, a species in which the STT was previously unexamined. One-week-old, 2-day-old and embryonic-day-18 mice did not differ from adults in the number or distribution of retrogradely labeled SIT neurons. Approximately 3,500 neurons were retrogradely labeled from one side of the thalamus in each age group. Eighty percent of the labeled cells were located on the side of the spinal cord contralateral to the injection site. Sixty-three percent of all labeled cells were located within the cervical cord, 18% in thoracic cord, and 19% in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Retrogradely labeled cells significantly increased in diameter over the first postnatal week. Arborizations and boutons within the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus were observed after the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the neonatal spinal cord. These data indicate that, whereas neurons of the STT continue to increase in size during the postnatal period, their axons reach the thalamus before birth and possess some of the morphological features required for functionality.

Neuroimaging studies have identified neural circuits underlying these responses in cocaine-dependent subjects. But these studies are often difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneity of the participants, substances abused, and differences in drug histories and social variables. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the functional effects of exposure to cocaine-associated stimuli in a non-human primate model of cocaine self-administration, providing precise control over these variables, with the 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose method. Rhesus monkeys self-administered 0.3mg/kg/injection cocaine (n=4) under a fixed-interval 3-minute (FI 3-min) schedule of reinforcement (30 injections/session) for 100 sessions. Control animals (n=4) underwent identical schedules of food reinforcement. Sessions were then discontinued for 30 days, after which time, monkeys were exposed to cocaine- or food-paired cues, and the 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose experiment was conducted. The presentation of the cocaine-paired cues resulted in significant increases in functional activity within highly restricted circuits that included portions of the pre-commissural striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, rostral temporal cortex and limbic thalamus when compared with control animals presented with the food-paired cues. The presentation of cocaine-associated cues increased brain functional activity in contrast to the decreases observed after cocaine consumption. Furthermore, the topography of brain circuits engaged by the expectation of cocaine is similar to the distribution of effects during the earliest phases of cocaine self-administration, prior to the onset of neuroadaptations that accompany chronic cocaine exposure.;"[Porrino, Linda J.; Beveridge, Thomas J.

Metabolic mapping studies in cocaine users and animal models have shown extensive functional alterations throughout the striatum, limbic system, and cortex. Few studies, however, have evaluated the persistence of these effects following cessation of cocaine availability. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess the functional effects of re-exposure to cocaine in nonhuman primates after the discontinuation of cocaine self-administration for 30 or 90 days, using the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose (2DG) method. Rhesus monkeys self-administered cocaine (fixed interval 3-min schedule, 30 infusions per session, 03 mg/kg/infusion) for 100 sessions followed by 30 (n = 4) or 90 days (n = 3) during which experimental sessions were not conducted. Food-reinforced control animals (n = 5) underwent identical schedules of reinforcement. Animals were then re-exposed to cocaine or food for one final session and the 2DG method applied immediately after session completion. Compared to controls, re-exposure to cocaine after 30 or 90 day drug-free periods resulted in lower rates of glucose utilization in ventral and dorsal striatum, prefrontal and temporal cortex, limbic system, thalamus, and midbrain. These data demonstrate that vulnerability to the effects of cocaine persists for as long as 90 days after cessation of drug use. While there was some evidence for recovery (fewer brain areas were affected by cocaine re-exposure at 90 days as compared to 30 days), this was not uniform across regions, thus suggesting that recovery occurs at different rates in different brain systems.

Eight human hemispheres were sectioned in comparable planes parallel to the ACPC plane. Microscopic slices were labeled with DiI and analyzed with confocal laser and polarized light microscopy. Three distinct systems of fibers were detected. Single fibers run from the caudate nucleus to the lentiform nucleus. The anterior thalamic peduncle connects the mediodorsal and partially the anterior thalamic nucleus with the frontal lobe. The frontopontine tract system connects the frontal lobe with the pens. This fiber tract occupies 38% of the anterior limb and is arranged in small bands. Right-left comparison of morphometric parameters of these bundles demonstrated that more and smaller bundles were located on the left-hand side than on the right-hand side. Tendencies for this configuration were noticeable in all brains investigated, with statistical significance in one brain. These morphological differences correlate with functional differences, as it was possible to demonstrate right hemispheric dysfunctions in cases of OCD. The benefit of anterior capsulotomy in OCD is generally seen in the interruption of fronto-basal ganglia-thalamic loops by disconnecting the anterior thalamic peduncle. In addition, the frontopontine fiber tract is disconnected in this stereotactic procedure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of blindsight' observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.;"[Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Vidyasagar, Trichur R.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Jayakumar, Jaikishan; Vidyasagar, Trichur R.] Univ Melbourne, Vis Sci & Melbourne Brain Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Dreher, Bogdan] Univ Sydney, Bosch Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";"University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Sydney; University of Sydney";Jayakumar, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Optometry, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.;trv@unimelb.edu.au;"Vidyasagar, Trichur/D-9665-2012; Jayakumar, Jaikishan/G-4675-2012";"Vidyasagar, Trichur/0000-0002-4148-2048; Jayakumar, Jaikishan/0000-0001-8925-723X";National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [509254, APP1004102];National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia);Dr J Jayakumar and some of our experiments reviewed in this article were supported by project grants 509254 and APP1004102 from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.;;94;9;9;0;16;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0816-4622;;;CLIN EXP OPTOM;Clin.

These include cortico-ponto-cerebellar projections originating throughout cerebral cortex, in addition to projections from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices via the thalamus. Such projections likely serve as important substrates for cerebellar involvement in human cognition, assuming their analogues are prominent in the human brain. These connections can be examined from a functional perspective through the use of functional connectivity MRI (FCMRII), a technique that allows the in vivo examination of coherence in MR signal among functionally related brain regions. Using this approach, low-frequency fluctuations in MR signal in the dentate nucleus correlated with signal fluctuations in cerebellar, thalamic, limbic, striatal, and cerebrocortical regions including parietal and frontal sites, with prominent coherence in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that FCMR1 is a useful tool for examining functional relationships between the cerebellum and other brain regions, and they support the findings from non-human primate studies showing anatomic projections from cerebellum to regions of cerebral cortex with known involvement in higher cognitive functions. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of functional coherence between the dentate nucleus and parietal and prefrontal cortices in the human brain, suggesting the presence of cerebellar-parietal and cerebellar-prefrontal functional connectivity.

Afferent and efferent projections were selectively labeled by applications of the lipophilic tracers Dil and DiA in aldehyde-fixed brains of 12-18-d-old rat embryos (E12-E18; gestation: 21 d). On E12 and E13, the neocortical anlage consists of a ventricular zone and a preplate, with no extracortical connections. By E14, just prior to the appearance of the cortical plate, polymorphic cells located in the ventrolateral preplate of the telencephalic vesicle send out the first group of corticofugal axons toward the ganglionic eminence. Shortly thereafter, the cortical plate emerges as a dense band of radially oriented cells that also contribute to the corticofugal projection. By E15, axons of the early cortical projection cells cascade through the striatal primordium, the future site of the internal capsule. At the time of cortical plate formation and initial corticofugal axon outgrowth, ascending corticopetal axon systems have not yet arrived in the neocortex. Double-labeling experiments in which one dye is placed in the neocortex and the other in the ipsilateral dorsal thalamus reveal that cortical efferents encounter the first ascending wave of thalamofugal axons at the level of the striatum. Collectively, these two axonal systems bridge the neocortex and the diencephalon. Upon their arrival in the neocortex on E16, thalamic axons follow a ventrolateral to dorsomedial course within the intermediate zone. Thalamic axons are the first subcortical afferent system to arrive in the neocortex. Other ascending afferent systems arising from the midbrain tegmentum enter the neocortex after E17. Comparison of thalamocortical and tegmentocortical projections in two halves of the same brain and across various embryonic ages clearly reveals that the two projection systems differ in their trajectories as well as in their time of arrival.

Whether DBS devices are compatible with higher field MRI scanning is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans can be safely performed on rhesus monkeys with implanted DBS devices. MethodsEight male rhesus monkeys were included in this study and stereotactically implanted with DBS devices in the left anterior thalamus. Two weeks after DBS device implantation, 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans were performed. The monkeys were observed for 72 hours. After explantation of the DBS system, 7.0 T MRI was repeated to determine potential lesions. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy were conducted to assess pathological alterations. ResultsIn both groups, the monkeys exhibited no behavioral changes related to neurological deficits. Post-explantation MRI showed no malacia foci surrounding the DBS tracks. Additionally, neither hematoxylin and eosin staining nor transmission electron microscopy showed clear injury near the DBS leads. ConclusionThese results indicate that no obvious heating injury was induced in the tissue surrounding the DBS leads by the 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans. Although the results of this study may not be generalizable, these data suggest that patients with implanted DBS devices can undergo even 7.0 T MRI without risk of brain injury.;"[Li, Jun-Ju; Shi, Lin; Chen, Ying-Chuan; Zhu, Guan-Yu; Zhang, Jian-Guo] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Tiantan Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun-Ju; Shi, Lin; Chen, Ying-Chuan; Zhu, Guan-Yu; Zhang, Jian-Guo] Beijing Neurosurg Inst, Funct Neurosurg Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun-Ju] Peoples Hosp Hainan Prov, Dept Neurosurg, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China";"Capital Medical University; Beijing Neurosurgical Institute";Zhang, JG (corresponding author), Beijing Neurosurg Inst, Tiantan West 6, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China.;shi-lin2015@foxmail.com;Shi, Lin/IRZ-3895-2023;Shi, Lin/0000-0002-4934-6649;National Natural Science Foundation of China [81641052];National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 81641052).;;21;0;0;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1094-7159;1525-1403;;NEUROMODULATION;Neuromodulation;FEB;2018;21;2;;;;;168;175;;10.1111/ner.12735;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ner.12735;;;8;"Medicine, Research & Experimental; Clinical Neurology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Research & Experimental Medicine; Neurosciences & Neurology";FV0WV;29219219;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:000424282700007;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focuses on our current knowledge of the dynamics the receptive field (RF) as broken down into the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) in primate LGN. CRFs in the LGN are known to be similar to those in the retinal ganglion cell layer in terms of both spatial and temporal characteristics, leading to the standard interpretation of the LGN as a relay center from retina to primary visual cortex. ECRFs have generally been found to be large and inhibitory, with some differences in magnitude between the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways. The specific contributions of the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex to LGN ECRF properties are presently unknown. Some reports suggest a retinal origin for extra-classical suppression based on latency arguments and other reports have suggested a thalamic origin for extra-classical suppression. This issue is complicated by the use of anesthetized animals, where cortical activity is likely to be altered. Thus further study of LGN ECRFs is warranted to reconcile these discrepancies. Producing descriptions of RF properties of LGN neurons could be enhanced by employing preferred naturalistic stimuli. Although there has been significant work in cats with natural scene stimuli and noise that statistically imitates natural scenes, we highlight a need for similar data from primates. Obtaining these data may be aided by recent advancements in experimental and analytical techniques that permit the efficient study of nonlinear RF characteristics in addition to traditional linear factors. In light of the reviewed topics, we conclude by suggesting experiments to more clearly elucidate the spatial and temporal structure of ECRFs of primate LGN neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.;"[Jansen, Michael; Jin, Jianzhong; Li, Xiaobing; Lashgari, Reza; Kremkow, Jens; Swadlow, Harvey A.; Zaidi, Qasim; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] SUNY Coll Optometry, Biol Sci, Dept Biol & Vis Sci, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Bereshpolova, Yulia; Swadlow, Harvey A.; Alonso, Jose-Manuel] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lashgari, Reza] Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Brain Engn Res Ctr, POB 193955746, Tehran, Iran; [Kremkow, Jens] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Neurosci Res Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany";"State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Optometry; University of Connecticut; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin";Alonso, JM (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Optometry, Dept Visual Sci, 33 West,42nd St,17th Floor, New York, NY 10036 USA.;jalonso@sunyopt.edu;"li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; Abrishami Moghaddam, Hamid/AAW-9288-2021";"Kremkow, Jens/0000-0001-7077-4528; Lashgari, Reza/0000-0003-1768-8342";National Institute of Health [EY027361];National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);Supported by the National Institute of Health (EY027361).;;87;28;28;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1047-3211;1460-2199;;CEREB CORTEX;Cereb.

To help identify possible subregions within the nucleus accumbens, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of core- and shell-like regions within the accumbens, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The rostral amygdala sent nearly equivalent projections to both the medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens, whereas projections arising from the middle and caudal amygdala terminated preferentially in the medial division of nucleus accumbens. The basal nucleus was the major source of these amygdala efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the basal and accessory basal nuclei terminated in different parts of nucleus accumbens. The subiculum was the major source of hippocampal projections to the nucleus accumbens, but some hippocampal efferents also originated in the parasubiculum, the prosubiculum, the adjacent portion of CA1, and the uncal portion of CA3. These hippocampal projections, which coursed through the fornix, showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the rostral hippocampus. Hippocampal efferents terminated most densely in the medial and ventral portions of nucleus accumbens, along with light label in the adjacent olfactory tubercle. The entorhinal projections were more evenly distributed between the medial nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the perirbinal projections were primarily to the olfactory tubercle. These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix. Amygdala and subicular (hippocampal) projections overlapped most completely in the medial division of nucleus accumbens.;"Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3YG, S Glam, Wales; Wake Forest Univ, Bowman Gray Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"Cardiff University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Aggleton, JP (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Pk Pl,POB 901, Cardiff CF10 3YG, S Glam, Wales.;aggleton@cardiff.ac.uk;Friedman, David P/G-7842-2011;"Friedman, David P/0000-0003-1732-2404; Aggleton, John/0000-0002-5573-1308";;;;;78;172;175;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

The PPN is involved in initiation and modulation of gait and other stereotyped motor behaviors and is inter-connected with the pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit. Internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) DBS is effective at treating the motor signs associated with PD, however its impact on MRGPA is limited and its effect on PPN neuronal activity is unknown. The current work characterizes the effect of therapeutically-effective GPi DBS on PPN neuronal activity in a single rhesus monkey made parkinsonian using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). A scaled-down, quadripolar DBS lead was implanted into sensorimotor GPi under electrophysiological and stereotactic guidance. Single-neuron activity was recorded from PPN before, during and after DBS. GPi DBS reduced the mean discharge rate of PPN neurons from 16.8 Hz to 12.8 Hz, with 30 (66.7%) neurons showing a decreased mean rate, 3 (6.7%) increased and 12 (26.7%) unchanged. Consistent with known GABAergic projections from GPi to PPN, and with previous observations that stimulation increases output from the stimulated structure, GPi DBS suppressed activity in the PPN. The present observations, together with previous reports of improvement in MRGPA during low frequency stimulation in PPN, suggest that activation of PPN output may be required to improve MRGPA and may account for the lack of improvement in MRGPA typically observed with GPi or subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS.

Most physiological studies of single neurons in the auditory cortex have focused on the onset and sustained portions of evoked responses, but there have been far fewer studies on the relationship between onset and offset responses. In the current study, we compared spectral and spatial tuning of onset and offset responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and the caudolateral (CL) belt area of awake macaque monkeys. Several different metrics were used to determine the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in both frequency and space domains. In the frequency domain, a substantial proportion of neurons in A1 and CL displayed highly dissimilar best stimuli for onset-and offset-evoked responses, although even for these neurons, there was usually a large overlap in the range of frequencies that elicited onset, and offset responses and distributions of tuning overlap metrics were mostly unimodal. In the spatial domain, the vast majority of neurons displayed very similar best locations for onset-and offset-evoked responses, along with unimodal distributions of all tuning overlap metrics considered. Finally, for both spectral and spatial tuning, a slightly larger fraction of neurons in A1 displayed nonoverlapping onset and offset response profiles, relative to CL, which supports hierarchical differences in the processing of sounds in the two areas. However, these differences are small compared with differences in proportions of simple cells (low overlap) and complex cells (high overlap) in primary and secondary visual areas. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the current study, we examine the relationship between the tuning of neural responses evoked by the onset and offset of acoustic stimuli in the primary auditory cortex, as well as a higher-order auditory area-the caudolateral belt field-in awake rhesus macaques. In these areas, the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in frequency and space domains formed a continuum, ranging from highly overlapping to highly nonoverlapping.;"[Ramamurthy, Deepa L.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95618 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis";Ramamurthy, DL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;dlramamurthy@ucdavis.edu;Ramamurthy, Deepa/HOH-5885-2023;Ramamurthy, Deepa/0000-0003-4064-5148;"National Institute on Aging [R01AG034137]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01DC015232]; National Eye Institute [2T32EY015387-11]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1148897]";"National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF))";"Funding for this work was provided by the National Institute on Aging (Grant R01AG034137) and National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (Grant R01DC015232; both to G.

Nonetheless, careful testing shows that certain visually guided behaviours can persist even in the absence of visual awareness(1-4). The neural circuits supporting this phenomenon, which is often termed blindsight, remain uncertain(4). Here we demonstrate that the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information. By comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural measures with and without temporary LGN inactivation, we assessed the contribution of the LGN to visual functions of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with chronic V1 lesions. Before LGN inactivation, high-contrast stimuli presented to the lesion-affected visual field (scotoma) produced significant V1-independent fMRI activation in the extrastriate cortical areas V2, V3, V4, V5/middle temporal (MT), fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the animals correctly located the stimuli in a detection task. However, following reversible inactivation of the LGN in the V1-lesioned hemisphere, fMRI responses and behavioural detection were abolished. These results demonstrate that direct LGN projections to the extrastriate cortex have a critical functional contribution to blindsight. They suggest a viable pathway to mediate fast detection during normal vision.;"[Schmid, Michael C.; Mrowka, Sylwia W.; Turchi, Janita; Saunders, Richard C.; Wilke, Melanie; Peters, Andrew J.; Leopold, David A.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ye, Frank Q.; Leopold, David A.] NEI, Neurophysiol Imaging Facil, NIMH, NINDS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Eye Institute (NEI); NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)";Schmid, MC (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, 49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;schmidmicha@gmail.com;"Schmid, Michael Christoph/AAH-4835-2020; Schmid, Michael C./G-1867-2010";"Schmid, Michael Christoph/0000-0003-1424-130X; Schmid, Michael C./0000-0003-1424-130X; Peters, Andrew/0000-0001-9351-1456; Leopold, David/0000-0002-1345-6360";"NIMH; NINDS; NEI";"NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NEI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI))";"We thank A.

The generalized seizure kindled from the amygdala was asymmetrical in cats with callosal bisection, destruction of massa intermedia of the thalamus or bilateral ventral hippocampus. The generalized convulsion of amygdala kindled cats became asymmetrical or changed into partial seizures by callosal bisection. The fully-kindled amygdala seizure of a split-brain epileptic baboon and rhesus monkey was a hemiconvulsion or an asymmetrical generalized convulsion. The amygdala-kindled bisymmetrical generalized convulsion of the epileptic baboon was changed into a hemiconvulsion or an asymmetrical generalized convulsion. These results indicate that the corpus callosum plays an imoprtant, although not exclusive, role in bilateralization of epileptic activity, and its role becomes more important when the animal ascends the phylogenetic scale.;;;OKAMOTO, M (corresponding author), OKAYAMA UNIV,SCH HLTH SCI,2-5-1 SHIKATACHO,OKAYAMA 700,JAPAN.;;;;;;;;4;3;3;0;0;FOLIA PUBL SOC;TOKYO;ACADEMIC SOCIETIES BLDG 2-4-16 YAYOI, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN;0912-2036;;;JPN J PSYCHIAT NEUR;;JUN;1991;45;2;;;;;257;260;;;;;;4;"Neurosciences; Psychiatry";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry";GE653;1762205;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1991GE65300010;View Full Record in Web of Science

THE ROLE OF CORTICOCORTICAL LOOPS;BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; PATTERNS; V1";This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a higher area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.;;;MUMFORD, D (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV,DEPT MATH,1 OXFORD ST,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138, USA.;;;;;;;;31;727;731;1;28;SPRINGER VERLAG;NEW YORK;175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010;0340-1200;;;BIOL CYBERN;Biol.

Furthermore, certain ventromedial cortical regions, namely the rhinal (i.e., entorhinal and perirhinal) cortex, are now known to be critical for visual recognition memory. Because the route taken by temporal cortical efferent fibers, especially perirhinar efferents, passes nearby the amygdala, it is possible that inadvertent damage to these fibers is produced by the aspirative but not the excitotoxic process, thereby accounting at least in part for the different behavioral outcomes of the two types of lesion. To test this idea, we assessed the integrity of the rhinal corticothalamic projection system after aspiration lesions of the amygdala. Three rhesus monkeys with unilateral amygdala removals received bilaterally symmetrical injections of a retrograde fluorescent tracer into the medial portion of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Retrogradely labeled cells were identified using conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques. In all three cases, the rhinal cortex of the intact hemispheres contained moderate numbers of retrogradely labeled cells. By contrast, the rhinal cortex of the amygdalectomized hemispheres consistently contained few retrogradely labeled cells, and a direct comparison of the two hemispheres showed this difference to be statistically significant. A similar asymmetric pattern was observed for area TE but not for the cortex lining the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, nor for the rostral cingulate motor area, which was examined as a control. The results indicate that aspiration lesions of the amygdala not only remove the cell bodies of the amygdala, as intended, but also inadvertently disrupt projection fibers arising from cells in the rhinal cortex and area TE that pass nearby or through the amygdala en route to the thalamus. Behavioral studies examining the effects of aspiration lesions of the amygdala in nonhuman primates need to take these findings into consideration.;"NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Laval, Ecole Psychol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Laval University";Murray, EA (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bldg 49,Room 1B80,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;eam@ln.nimh.nih.gov;Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019;Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642;;;;;53;43;43;0;0;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0014-4819;1432-1106;;EXP BRAIN RES;Exp.

The nonhuman primate has been used as a model to study anxiety-related mechanisms in humans based upon similarities in behavior and the presence of a similar 5-HT transporter gene polymorphism. Stressful and threatening contexts in the nonhuman primate model have revealed 5-HT transporter genotype dependent differences in regional glucose metabolism. Using the rhesus monkey, we examined the extent to which serotonin transporter genotype is associated with 5-HT transporter binding in brain regions implicated in emotion-related pathology. Methods: Genotype data and high resolution PET scans were acquired in 29 rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. [C-11]DASB dynamic PET scans were acquired for 90 min in the anesthetized animals and images of distribution volume ratio (DVR) were created to serve as a metric of 5-HT transporter binding for group comparison based on a reference region method of analysis. Regional and voxelwise statistical analysis were performed with corrections for anatomical differences in gray matter probability, sex, age and radioligand mass. Results: There were no significant differences when comparing 1/1 homozygotes with s-carriers in the regions of the brain implicated in anxiety and mood related illnesses (amygdala, striatum, thalamus, raphe nuclei, temporal and prefrontal cortex). There was a significant sex difference in 5-HT transporter binding in all regions with females having 18%-28% higher DVR than males. Conclusions: Because these findings are consistent with similar genotype findings in humans, this further strengthens the use of the rhesus model for studying anxiety-related neuropathologies.

The pattern of anatomical connections from the primate auditory cortex to the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal lobes suggests a possible division into dorsal and ventral auditory processing streams, with the dorsal stream originating from more caudal areas of the auditory cortex, and the ventral stream originating from more rostral areas. These streams are hypothesized to be analogous to the well-established dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In the visual system, the dorsal processing stream shows substantially faster neural response latencies than does the ventral stream. However, the relative timing of putative dorsal and ventral stream processing has yet to be explored in other sensory modalities. Here, we compare distributions of neural response latencies from 10 different areas of macaque auditory cortex, confirmed by individual anatomical reconstructions, to determine whether a similar timing advantage is found for the hypothesized dorsal auditory stream. Across three varieties of auditory stimuli (clicks, noise, and pure tones), we find that latencies increase with hierarchical level, as predicted by anatomical connectivity. Critically, we also find a pronounced timing differential along the caudal-to-rostral axis within the same hierarchical level, with caudal (dorsal stream) latencies being faster than rostral (ventral stream) latencies. This observed timing differential mirrors that found for the dorsal stream of the visual system, suggestive of a common timing advantage for the dorsal stream across sensory modalities.;"[Camalier, Corrie R.; D'Angelo, William R.; Sterbing-D'Angelo, Susanne J.; Hackett, Troy A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [de la Mothe, Lisa A.; Hackett, Troy A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Hearing & Speech Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [de la Mothe, Lisa A.] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Camalier, Corrie R.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol Surg, Nashville, TN 37232 USA";"Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University; Tennessee State University; Vanderbilt University";Camalier, CR (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol, Nashville, TN 37240 USA.;corrie.camalier@vanderbilt.edu;Sterbing-D'Angelo, Susanne J/H-5899-2012;Sterbing, Susanne/0000-0002-8958-6938;"National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01 DC-04318]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P30 HD15052]";"National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))";The authors thank Warren Lambert for statistical consultation.

Results were obtained using chronic recording techniques in awake or lightly tranquilized animals. Most neurons were unable to follow the temporal order of vibrations in excess of 10 Hz. A smaller sample of cells provided faithful reproduction of frequencies up to 50-75 Hz and another responded to low amplitude, high frequency stimulation in excess of 100 Hz. Cells that displayed temporally cohesive responses to lower frequencies demonstrated predictable, time-locked discharges to successive stimulus cycles. Cells activated by higher frequencies showed a lower probability of following successive stimulus cycles.

On the basis of percentage scores the published data can be interpreted as showing that the ability to recognize a previously seen object decays faster in macaques with brain lesions than it does in normal animals. A reanalysis of the extensive data in terms of d' of Signal Detection Theory or by arcsine transform suggests, on the contrary, that the rate of decay from 0 to 600 s, is essentially the same in normal animals and in those with lesions (particularly temporal lobe lesions). Indeed, in d' or arcsine terms, the effect of the lesions is fully developed at the shortest times used, and shows no increase as a function of the delay between initial presentation and test.

Its chemical structure and toxicological properties are similar to kainic acid. Like kainic acid, exposure results in extensive hippocampal degeneration. The effect of domoic acid on other primate brain structures, however, is less resolved. In an attempt to clarify this issue, the present study applied a degeneration specific histochemical technique (de Olmos' cupric-silver method) to reveal degeneration within the brains of domoic acid-dosed cynomolgus monkeys. Degenerating neuronal cell bodies and terminals were found not only within the hippocampus, but also within a number of other 'limbic' structures including the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the piriform cortex, the lateral septum, and the dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus. Although the hippocampus is a component of the original limbic circuit of Papez, other components such as the mammillary bodies, the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the cingulate cortex contained no degeneration, while a number of more recently documented efferent targets of the hippocampal formation revealed extensive degeneration.

The study shows the existence of a number of different local circuit neurons making interlaminar projections between 4B, 4A, and 3B; each provides specific cross links between different combinations of the three laminae. It is known that the functional properties recorded physiologically from layers 4B, 4A, and 3B differ from one another and so these anatomical cross links may allow for correlation between different attributes of visual stimuli, e.g., color or motion, while still enabling separate processing of these different attributes to proceed in each of the three layers and be passed on to extrastriate areas. Whereas no spine-bearing neurons of layers 4B, 4A, or 3B provide feedback circuits to layer 4C (the source of their major intrinsic excitatory afferents), some of the local circuit neurons provide precisely structured axon feedback projections to divisions of 4C. The local circuit neurons also project to either lamina 5 or lamina 6, but not both and to superficial layers 3A, 2, and 1.

In addition, recent positron emission tomography studies implicate the subgenual region in depression and mania. To determine the subcortical projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in area 25 in three monkeys. In contrast to the efferents from area 25 previously described in the rat, there were no projections to autonomic effector regions, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract, magnocellular neurosecretory cell groups in the hypothalamus, ventrolateral medulla, or intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. However, projections were shown to a number of structures with probable roles in autonomic function and direct connections to some of the abovementioned autonomic effector regions, including bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, perifornical and anterior hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and lateral parabrachial nucleus. In addition, there were projections to several forebrain structures that receive projections from other components of the medial prefrontal network including the medial part of the caudate nucleus, lateral septum. midline and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, the lateral parvocellular part of the basal accessory amygdaloid nucleus, and the magnocellular part of the basal amygdaloid. None of the injections resulted in labeling in the medulla. These connections support the idea of a role for cortical area 25 in emotional and autonomic responses, albeit less direct than that described in rodents.

Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico-cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task-dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large-scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large-scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.;"[Eradath, Manoj K.; Pinsk, Mark A.; Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kastner, Sabine] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA";"Princeton University; Princeton University";Eradath, MK (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;meradath@princeton.edu;Eradath, Manoj Kumar/AAT-4001-2021;Eradath, Manoj Kumar/0000-0003-3300-4772;"National Eye Institute [2R01EY017699]; National Institute of Mental Health [2R01MH064043, P50MH109429]";"National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))";"National Eye Institute, Grant/Award Number: 2R01EY017699; National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Numbers: 2R01MH064043, P50MH109429";;91;7;7;2;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-9967;1096-9861;;J COMP NEUROL;J.

One of the most salient models for studying the functional specialization of parallel visual streams in the primate brain is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus, through which the parvocellular and magnocellular channels, On-center and Off-center channels, and ipsilateral and contralateral eye channels are maintained and provide the foundation for cortical processing. We examined three aspects of neural processing in these streams: (1) the relationship between extraclassical surround suppression, a widespread visual computation thought to represent a canonical neural computation, and the parallel channels of the LGN; (2) the magnitude of binocular interaction in the parallel streams; and (3) the magnitude of suppression elicited by perceptual competition (binocular rivalry) in each stream. Our results show that surround suppression is almost exclusive to Off channel cells; further, we found evidence for two different components of monocular surround suppression-an early-stage suppression exhibited by all magnocellular cells, and a late-stage suppression exhibited only by Off cells in both the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways. This finding indicates that stream-specific circuits contribute to surround suppression in the primate LGN and suggests a distinct role for suppression in the Off channel to the cortex. We also examined the responses of LGN neurons in alert macaque monkeys to determine whether neurons that supply the cortex with visual information are influenced by stimulation of both eyes. Our results demonstrate that LGN neurons are not influenced by stimulation of the non-dominant eye. This was the case when dichoptic stimuli were presented to classical receptive fields of neurons, extraclassical receptive fields of neurons, and when stimuli were appropriate to produce the perception of binocular rivalry.";"[Lankow, Benjamin S.; Usrey, W.

Numerous brain mechanisms probably contribute to discounting this jitter. Changes in the timing of responses in the visual thalamus associated with fixational saccades are considered in this study. Activity of single neurons in alert monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was recorded during fixation while pseudorandom visual noise stimuli were presented. The position of the stimulus on the display monitor was adjusted based on eye position measurements to control for changes in retinal locations due to eye movements. A method for extracting nonstationary first-order response mechanisms was applied, so that changes around the times of saccades could be observed. Saccade-related changes were seen in both amplitude and timing of geniculate responses. Amplitudes were greatly reduced around saccades. Timing was retarded slightly during a window of about 200 ms around saccades. That is, responses became more sustained. These effects were found in both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Timing changes in LGN might play a role in maintaining cortical responses to visual stimuli in the presence of eye movements, compensating for the spatial shifts caused by saccades via these shifts in timing.;Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30912 USA;"University System of Georgia; Augusta University";Saul, AB (corresponding author), Med Coll Georgia, Dept Ophthalmol, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.;asaul@mcg.edu;;;Knights Templar Educational Foundation;Knights Templar Educational Foundation;Supported by Knights Templar Educational Foundation.

Much of the work on animal foraging has focused on factors relating to the amount of time and energy animals expend searching for and harvesting foods. Models that emphasize such factors have been invaluable in determining when it is beneficial for an animal to search for pastures new. When foraging, however, animals also have to determine how to direct their search. For what food should they forage? There is no point searching for more of a particular food when you are sated from eating it. Here we review work in macaques and humans that has sought to reveal the neural circuits critical for determining the subjective value of different foods and associated objects in our environment and tracking this value over time. There is mounting evidence that a network composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and medial thalamus is critical for linking objects in the environment with food value and adjusting those valuations in real time based on current biological needs. Studies using temporary inactivation methods have revealed that the amygdala and OFC play distinct yet complementary roles in this valuation process. Such a network for determining the subjective value of different foods and, by extension, associated objects, must interact with systems that determine where and for how long to forage. Only by efficiently incorporating these two factors into their decisions will animals be able to achieve maximal fitness.;"[Murray, Elisabeth A.; Rudebeck, Peter H.] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Learning & Memory, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)";Murray, EA (corresponding author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, Bldg 49,Suite 1B80,49 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;murraye@mail.nih.gov;"Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019; Rudebeck, Peter H/G-7931-2012";"Rudebeck, Peter/0000-0002-1411-7555; Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642";Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health;Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH));This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.

In the rhesus monkey, the number of geniculate layers changes abruptly from six posteriorly (central vision) to four anteriorly (peripheral vision). The plane of transition between these patterns passes through small laminar gaps corresponding to the perceptual blind spot caused by the exit of the optic nerve from the eyeball. However, this plane of transition has no apparent functional link to the blind spot. A thermodynamic model of geniculate morphogenesis supports the hypothesis that the blind spot traps the transition in its stereotypic position by introducing a singularity in an otherwise smooth gradient in forces guiding the development of geniculate morphogenesis. This relation suggests that small-scale anomalies may be important in the determination of large-scale patterns in biological structure.;"UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT PSYCHOL,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61820; UNIV ILLINOIS,NEUROSCI PROGRAM,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61820";"University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign";;;Lee, Daeyeol/A-6794-2008;Lee, Daeyeol/0000-0003-3474-019X;NEI NIH HHS [EY02695] Funding Source: Medline;NEI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI));;;13;18;18;0;3;AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE;WASHINGTON;1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005;0036-8075;;;SCIENCE;Science;MAR 4;1994;263;5151;;;;;1292;1294;;10.1126/science.8122115;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.8122115;;;3;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Science & Technology - Other Topics;MY570;8122115;;;;2023-07-27;WOS:A1994MY57000041;View Full Record in Web of Science

Neuroimaging is increasingly used to develop models of vPFC connections, to examine white matter (WM) integrity, and to target surgical interventions, including deep brain stimulation. We used primate (Macaca nemestrina/Macaca fascicularis) tracing studies and 3D reconstructions of WM tracts to delineate the rules vPFC projections follow to reach their targets. vPFC efferent axons travel through the uncinate fasciculus, connecting different vPFC regions and linking different functional regions. The uncinate fasciculus also is a conduit for vPFC fibers to reach other cortical bundles. Fibers in the internal capsule are organized according to destination. Thalamic fibers from each vPFC region travel dorsal to their brainstem fibers. The results show regional differences in the trajectories of fibers from different vPFC areas. Overall, the medial/lateral vPFC position dictates the route that fibers take to enter major WM tracts, as well as the position within specific tracts: axons from medial vPFC regions travel ventral to those from more lateral areas. This arrangement, coupled with dorsal/ventral organization of thalamic/brainstem fibers through the internal capsule, results in a complex mingling of thalamic and brainstem axons from different vPFC areas. Together, these data provide the foundation for dividing vPFC WM bundles into functional components and for predicting what is likely to be carried at different points through each bundle. These results also help determine the specific connections that are likely to be captured at different neurosurgical targets.;"[Lehman, Julia F.; Haber, Suzanne N.] Univ Rochester, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sch Med, Rochester, NY 14642 USA; [Greenberg, Benjamin D.; Rasmussen, Steve A.] Butler Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Greenberg, Benjamin D.; Rasmussen, Steve A.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [McIntyre, Cameron C.] Cleveland Clin Fdn, Dept Biomed Engn, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA";"University of Rochester; Butler Hospital Rhode Island; Brown University; Cleveland Clinic Foundation";Haber, SN (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Sch Med, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.;suzanne_haber@urmc.rochester.edu;;;"National Institute of Mental Health [MH73111, MH086400]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS059736]";"National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))";This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grants MH73111 and MH086400 and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant NS059736.

Reconstructions of labeled axonal varicosities in the neostriatum and ventrobasal thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to these subcortical structures. For both groups of animals, corticostriatal projections terminated in densely packed clusters that occupied curved lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. When the tracers were injected into different whisker barrel rows, the distribution of BDA- and FR-labeled terminals in the neostriatum followed a crude somatotopic organization in which the amount of overlap was approximately the same as in the ventrobasal thalamus. When both tracers were injected into the same whisker barrel row, however, the amount of corticostriatal overlap was significantly higher than the amount of overlap observed in the ventrobasal thalamus. These results indicate that corticostriatal projections from whisker barrel cortex have an anisotropic organization that correlates with the pattern of vibrissal movements during whisking behavior.";Penn State Univ, Milton S Hershey Med Ctr H109, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Hershey, PA 17033 USA;"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Penn State Health";Alloway, KD (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Milton S Hershey Med Ctr H109, Coll Med, Dept Anat & Neurosci, 500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.;;Crist, J/HTP-7792-2023;;NINDS NIH HHS [NS-37532, NS-29363] Funding Source: Medline;NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS));;;67;65;67;0;0;SOC NEUROSCIENCE;WASHINGTON;11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0270-6474;;;J NEUROSCI;J.

Previous structural MRI studies have identified regional abnormalities in grey matter, especially in the basal ganglia. These findings are consistent with the assumption of alterations in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits and dopaminergic neurotransmission playing a major role in the pathophysiology of GTS. Additionally, recent imaging studies suggested an involvement of sensory-motor cortices in the pathophysiology of GTS. However, little is known about the role of white matter changes in GTS. In this study, we aimed to examine whether GTS is associated with abnormalities in white matter microstructure and whether these changes are correlated with tic severity. In a morphometric study based on diffusion tensor MRI of the whole brain, we compared brain tissue diffusion characteristics between 15 unmedicated adults with GTS without psychiatric co-morbidity and 15 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. We performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of regional fractional anisotropy (FA) values to identify regional differences in white matter microstructure between the groups. We also tested for a linear relationship between regional FA values and clinical scores of tic severity. Probabilistic fibre tracking was applied to characterize anatomical connectivity of those areas showing differences in regional FA. Compared with healthy controls, GTS patients showed bilateral FA increases in white matter underlying the post- and precentral gyrus, below the left supplementary motor area, and in the right ventro-postero-lateral part of the thalamus. The peak increase in FA was located below the left postcentral gyrus. Probabilistic tractography identified transcallosal and ipsilateral cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways of the somatosensory system passing through this subcortical region. In patients, regional FA in this region showed an inverse linear relationship with tic severity. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, structural alterations in somatosensory pathways in GTS. Changes of water diffusion characteristics point towards reduced branching in somatosensory pathways in GTS patients. The negative correlation between higher regional FA values and fewer tics suggests that these alterations of white matter microstructure represent adaptive reorganization of somatosensory processing in GTS.;"[Thomalla, Goetz; Jonas, Melanie; Baeumer, Tobias; Hummel, Friedhelm; Gerloff, Christian; Orth, Michael; Muenchau, Alexander] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Siebner, Hartwig R.] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Dept Neurol, Kiel, Germany; [Jonas, Melanie] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Biermann-Ruben, Katja; Schnitzler, Alfons] Dusseldorf Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, MEG Lab, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Biermann-Ruben, Katja; Schnitzler, Alfons] Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Clin Neurosci & Med Psychol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Mueller-Vahl, Kirsten] Hannover Med Sch, Clin Psychiat Socialpsychiat & Psychotherapy, D-3000 Hannover, Germany";"University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; University of Kiel; University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Hannover Medical School";Thomalla, G (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.;thomalla@uke.uni-hamburg.de;"Schnitzler, Alfons/K-4625-2014; Schnitzler, Alfons/Q-5520-2019; Biermann-Ruben, Katja/ITV-1598-2023; Schnitzler, Alfons/AAT-1054-2021; Thomalla, Götz/HPB-8558-2023; Siebner, Hartwig Roman/ISS-8209-2023";"Schnitzler, Alfons/0000-0002-6414-7939; Schnitzler, Alfons/0000-0002-6414-7939; Schnitzler, Alfons/0000-0002-6414-7939; Thomalla, Götz/0000-0002-4785-1449; Siebner, Hartwig Roman/0000-0002-3756-9431; Muller-Vahl, Kirsten/0000-0002-7181-7419";"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [MU1692/2-1]; University of Hamburg [F168-1]";"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Hamburg";"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (MU1692/2-1 to A.

While some forms of hearing deficits are peripheral in origin, others are centrally mediated. One such deficit is the ability to localize sounds, a critical component for segregating different acoustic objects and events, which is dependent on the auditory cortex. Recent evidence indicates that in aged animals the normal sharpening of spatial tuning between neurons in primary auditory cortex to the caudal lateral field does not occur as it does in younger animals. As a decrease in inhibition with aging is common in the ascending auditory system, it is possible that this lack of spatial tuning sharpening is due to a decrease in inhibition at different periods within the response. It is also possible that spatial tuning was decreased as a consequence of reduced inhibition at non-best locations. In this report we found that aged animals had greater activity throughout the response period, but primarily during the onset of the response. This was most prominent at non-best directions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition is a primary mechanism for sharpening spatial tuning curves. We also noted that in aged animals the latency of the response was much shorter than in younger animals, which is consistent with a decrease in pre-onset inhibition. These results can be interpreted in the context of a failure of the timing and efficiency of feed-forward thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits in aged animals. Such a mechanism, if generalized across cortical areas, could play a major role in age-related cognitive decline.;"[Engle, James R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Engle, James R.; Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Neurosci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, Evelyn F McKnight Brain Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [Engle, James R.] Univ Arizona, ARL Div Neural Syst Memory & Aging, Tucson, AZ USA; [Recanzone, Gregg H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Davis";Recanzone, GH (corresponding author), Ctr Neurosci, 1544 Newton Ct, Davis, CA 95618 USA.;ghrecanzone@ucdavis.edu;;;"NIA [R21AG024372, R01AG034137]; NIDCD [T32DC008072]; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG034137, R21 AG024372] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCD NIH HHS [T32 DC008072] Funding Source: Medline";"NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDCD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD))";The authors would like to thank Xochi Navarro and Dina Juarez-Salinas for their help with this project, and Rhonda Oates-O'Brien and Guy Martin for excellent animal care.

Here, we show that a pulvino-cortical circuit model, composed of the pulvinar and two cortical areas, captures several physiological and behavioral observations related to the macaque pulvinar. Effective connections between the two cortical areas are gated by the pulvinar, allowing the pulvinar to shift the operation regime of these areas during attentional processing and working memory and resolve conflict in decision making. Furthermore, cortico-pulvinar projections that engage the thalamic reticular nucleus enable the pulvinar to estimate decision confidence. Finally, feedforward and feedback pulvino-cortical pathways participate in frequency-dependent inter-areal interactions that modify the relative hierarchical positions of cortical areas. Overall, our model suggests that the pulvinar provides crucial contextual modulation to cortical computations associated with cognition.;"[Jaramillo, Jorge; Wang, Xiao-Jing] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mejias, Jorge F.] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Neurosci, Swammerdam Inst Life Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Wang, Xiao-Jing] Shanghai Res Ctr Brain Sci & Brain Inspired Intel, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China";"New York University; University of Amsterdam";"Wang, XJ (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Res Ctr Brain Sci & Brain Inspired Intel, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China.";xjwang@nyu.edu;;"Mejias, Jorge/0000-0002-8096-4891; Jaramillo, Jorge/0000-0002-6666-899X";"NIH [R01MH062349]; Simons Foundation Collaboration on the Global Brain grant";"NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Simons Foundation Collaboration on the Global Brain grant";This work was supported by NIH grant R01MH062349 and a Simons Foundation Collaboration on the Global Brain grant (X.-J.W.).

It uses established protocols to estimate the volume and number of neurons within the output nuclei (internal globus pallidus, IGP; and nondopaminergic substantia nigra, SNND), two internal relay and modulating nuclei (subthalamic nucleus, STh; and external globus pallidus, EGP), and a modulator of the striatum (dopaminergic substantia nigra, SND). Nuclear boundaries were defined by using immunohistochemistry for striatal afferents. Total numbers of Nissl-stained and parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were calculated by using the fractionator technique. Comparisons between species were standardized relative to brain mass (rats < marmosets < macaques < baboons < humans). The EGP consistently had more neurons relative to the IGP, STh, and SND, which had similar neuronal numbers within each species. The SNND had proportionally more neurons in rats than in primates (especially humans). The distribution of SND neurons varied substantially between rats and primates (very few ventrally located neurons in rats) with humans containing fewer SND neurons than other primates. The reduction in SND neurons in humans suggests less dopaminergic regulation of the basal ganglia system compared with other species. The consistency in the number of IGP neurons across all species, combined with the reduction in SNND neurons in humans, suggests a greater emphasis on output pathways through the IGP and that there are proportionally more STh and EGP neurons in humans.

Previous observations on the effect of ablation or inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) on the responses of neurons within the second somatosensory area(SII) to tactile stimuli point to profound differences between monkeys and certain other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems. In the cat, for example, tactile information appears to be conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII, whereas, in macaque and marmoset monkeys, it is conveyed in a serial (or hierarchical) scheme from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII. The present study examined the responses of individual SII neurons during reversible, cooling-induced inactivation of SI in another nonprimate placental mammal, the rabbit, to obtain further evidence on whether the above differences might reflect a fundamental distinction between simian primates and other mammalian species. 2. When the temperature at the face of a silver cooling block over the forepaw and hindpaw regions of SI was lowered to 5-13-degrees-C, the SI surface potentials evoked by brief tactile stimuli were abolished (indicative of SI inactivation), whereas SII potentials remained intact. 3. The responses of 25 SII neurons to controlled tactile stimuli (consisting of 1- to 1.5-s trains of vibration or rectangular mechanical pulses) were studied before, during, and after inactivation of SI. The effects on the spontaneous activity of a further three SII neurons that lacked identified receptive fields were also studied. 4. The response or activity levels of 26 of the 28 SII neurons examined (93%) were unaffected by SI inactivation. Furthermore, the temporal precision of responses at a particular phase of the repetitive mechanical stimuli also appeared to be unaffected by SI inactivation. The 28 neurons studied were located at different depths of the SII cortex and represented different functional classes, which included dynamically sensitive tactile neurons activated from glabrous or hairy skin by 5- to 10-Hz trains of mechanical stimuli and two neurons activated by high-frequency (300 Hz) cutaneous vibration, whose input appeared to come from pacinian corpuscles. 5. Only 2 of the 28 SII neurons exhibited a reduction in response to cutaneous stimuli during SI inactivation. However, because there was some evidence for a reduction in spontaneous activity in those neurons during SI inactivation, SI may exert a background facilitatory influence on the responsiveness of some SII neurons. 6. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that, in the rabbit, tactile information conveyed to SII is not dependent on an intracortical serially organized path through SI. Rather, the observations indicate that, in the rabbit, as in the cat, SI and SII are organized in parallel for the processing of information from the thalamus. These observations contrast with those in monkeys, where tactile processing is organized in a serial scheme, and support the hypothesis that there is a fundamental difference between simian primates and other mammals in the functional organization of thalamocortical tactile systems.;UNIV NEW S WALES,SCH PHYSIOL & PHARMACOL,SYDNEY 2033,AUSTRALIA;University of New South Wales Sydney;;;Murray, Grainne/AAK-1591-2021;"Murray, Grainne/0000-0003-0741-9288; Campbell, Douglas/0000-0001-9699-1854";;;;;29;28;28;0;0;AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC;BETHESDA;9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814;0022-3077;;;J NEUROPHYSIOL;J.

The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a number of modules, which seem to provide multiple subloops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical connections in subhuman primates. There may be a gnat degree of convergence of the limbic, associative and motor loops at the level of the striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus. Nigral dopaminergic neurons receive limbic input directly as well as indirectly through the striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to behavioral learning by signaling motivation and reinforcement. The pedunculopontine nucleus might be involved in behavioral state control, learning and reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas receives a mixed and weighted transthalamic input from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia. In particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm motor area and adjacent premotor area receive strong superficial basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections as well as the deep cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas, have very dense corticocotrical connections with other cortical areas, receive polymodal afferents from the parietal and temporal cortices, and integrated information, via multiple routes, from the prefrontal cortex. The author suggests that the ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi are linked directly to these areas by ways of the oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo) and the Ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), respectively. These connections are thought to be involved in the acquisition and coordination of motor sequences. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two specific retinothalamic projections to area MT have been speculated to relay through the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar nucleus (PIm) and the koniocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although a number of studies have demonstrated retinal inputs to regions of the thalamus where relays to area MT have been observed, the relationship between the retinal terminals and area MT relay cells has not been established. Here we examined direct retino-recipient regions of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) pulvinar nucleus and the LGN following binocular injections of anterograde tracer, as well as area MT relay cells in these nuclei by injection of retrograde tracer into area MT. Retinal afferents were shown to synapse with area MT relay cells as demonstrated by colocalization with the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin. We also established the presence of direct synapes of retinal afferents on area MT relay cells within the PIm, as well as the koniocellular K1 and K3 layers of the LGN, thereby corroborating the existence of two disynaptic pathways from the retina to area MT that bypass V1.;"[Warner, Claire E.; Goldshmit, Yona; Bourne, James A.] Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Warner, Claire E.] Monash Univ, Dept Anat & Dev Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia";"Monash University; Monash University";Bourne, JA (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Regenerat Med Inst, Bourne Grp, Level 1 N,Bldg 75,STRIP 1, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.;james.bourne@armi.monash.edu.au;Bourne, James/B-5265-2018;Bourne, James/0000-0002-0902-3108;National Health and Medical Research Council [436620];National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia);"The authors would like to thank Prof. Paul Martin, Dr Tobias Merson and Rowan Tweedale for making many suggestions that improved this manuscript, Robert Bryson-Richardson for assistance with confocal microscopy and the facilities, scientific and technical assistance of Monash Micro Imaging, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.

The clinical characteristics of the disease varied, the age at onset depending on patients with juvenile-onset were characterized by myoclonus, epilepsy, and mental retardation whereas cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis, and dementia were typical of adult- and senile-onset patients. All affected individuals showed one expanded allele with the repeat number of CAG at the DRPLA locus, ranging from 58 to 82, and a normal allele, ranging from 10 to 21. The most severely affected patient, a case of maternal transmission and with the largest allele, became bedridden in a vegetative state by age 12. On the CT and MRI, varying degrees of brain atrophy were present in all patients. T2-weighted MRI in patients with senile-onset showed symmetric high-signal lesions in the cerebral white matter, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, and pens. However, MRI in younger patients revealed no such lesions and CT failed to demonstrate lesions in the globus pallidus and brain stem. Thus, intrafamilial heterogeneity of DRPLA was also evident on MRI.

Experiments were carried out on three awake macaque monkeys. Animals sat in a primate chair in front of a large screen, and fixated a small spot of light projected in different screen locations while the activity of single neurons was extracellularly recorded. Both visual and non-visual neurons were found. About 48% of visual and 32% of non-visual neurons showed eye position-related activity in total darkness, while in similar to 61% of visual neurons the visual response was modulated by eye position in the orbit. Eye position fields and/or gain fields were different from cell to cell, going from large and quite planar fields up to peak-shaped fields localized in more or less restricted regions of the animal's field of view, The spatial distribution of fixation point locations evoking peak activity in the eye position-sensitive population did not show any evident laterality effect, or significant top/bottom asymmetry. Moreover, the cortical distribution of eye position-sensitive neurons was quite uniform all over the cortical region studied, suggesting the absence of segregation for this property within area PO (V6). In the great majority of visual neurons, the receptive field 'moved' with gaze according to eye displacements, remaining at the same retinotopic coordinates, as is usual for visual neurons. In some cases, the receptive field did not move with gaze, remaining anchored to the same spatial location regardless of eye movements ('real-position cells'). A model is proposed suggesting how eye position-sensitive visual neurons might build up real-position cells in local networks within area PO (V6). The presence in area PO (V6) of real-position cells together with a high percentage of eye position-sensitive neurons, most of them visual in nature, suggests that this cortical area is engaged in the spatial encoding of extrapersonal visual space. Since lesions of the superior parietal lobule in humans produce deficits in visual localization of targets as well as in arm-reaching for them, and taking into account that the monkey's area PO (V6) is reported to be connected with the premotor area 6, we suggest that area PO (V6) supplies the premotor cortex with the visuo-spatial information required for the visual control of arm-reaching movements.;UNIV TRIESTE, IST FISIOL, TRIESTE, ITALY;University of Trieste;Galletti, C (corresponding author), UNIV BOLOGNA, IST FISIOL UMANA, CATTEDRA FISIOL GEN, PIAZZA PORTA S DONATO 2, I-40127 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;;Fattori, Patrizia/Q-8947-2017;"Fattori, Patrizia/0000-0002-0079-3755; Battaglini, Piero Paolo/0000-0003-4697-8648; GALLETTI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8927-3408";;;;;50;226;228;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0953-816X;1460-9568;;EUR J NEUROSCI;Eur.

[I-125]iodoMLA bound throughout the brain with the greatest density in the thalamus and moderate intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical regions. The Kd and Bmax in whole brain tissue were similar whether 1 mM nicotine (Kd 33.25 +/- 15.17 nM, Bmax 5.80 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) or 2 mu M of the alpha 7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (Kd 46.12 +/- 18.45 nM, Bmax 6.30 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) was used for nonspecific binding. The subtype-selectivity of this ligand was further studied with competition binding studies using nicotine, alpha-bungarotoxin and noniodinated MLA. Each ligand completely inhibited [I-125]iodoMLA binding throughout the monkey brain, with Ki values of 2.23 +/- 0.85 mu M for nicotine, 2.72 +/- 1.71 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin and 1.83 +/- 0.35 nM MLA in the caudate and 2.03 +/- 1.14 mu M, 2.65 +/- 0.86 nM and 3.32 +/- 0.71 nM, respectively, in the putamen. The alpha 3 beta 2/alpha 6*-selective antagonist alpha-conotoxin MII failed to inhibit [I-125]iodoMLA binding in any brain region. In monkeys with cognitive deficits resulting from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration, [I-125]iodoMLA binding was significantly increased in the striatum, similar to results previously observed for [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, [I-125]iodoMLA was selective for alpha 7-containing nAChRs and did not bind to alpha 6-containing nAChRs.

Less is known about the long-term neurobiological impact of ELS. We used [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) to assess neural responses to a moderate stress test in adult monkeys that experienced ELS as infants. Both groups of monkeys showed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress-induced activations and cardiac arousal in response to the stressor. A whole brain analysis detected significantly greater regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in superior temporal sulcus, putamen, thalamus, and inferotemporal cortex of ELS animals compared to controls. Region of interest (ROI) analyses performed in areas identified as vulnerable to ELS showed greater activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of ELS compared to control monkeys, but greater hippocampal activity in the control compared to ELS monkeys. Together, these results suggest hyperactivity in emotional and sensory processing regions of adult monkeys with ELS, and greater activity in stress-regulatory areas in the controls. Despite these neural responses, no group differences were detected in neuroendocrine, autonomic or behavioral responses, except for a trend towards increased stillness in the ELS monkeys. Together, these data suggest hypervigilance in the ELS monkeys in the absence of immediate danger. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Neuromechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism via our established non-human primate model of COVID-19. In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro.

Small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons were microiontophoretically injected with biotin-dextran or biocytin and their labeled axons were individually reconstructed from serial horizontal sections immunostained for calbindin-D28k to delineate striatal patch/matrix compartments. Reconstruction of >40 axons shows that all Cg3 corticofugal fibers, including corticothalamic axons from layer VI, course through the patch network in the rostromedial sector of the striatum. Corticostriatal projections arise from two types of layer V cells: (i) long-range corticofugal neurons, whose main axons reach the brainstem and/or spinal cord, and (ii) neurons arborizing into both striatum and claustrum, either ipsi-. contra- or bilaterally. The axons of these two types of neurons arborize profusely in striatal patches and only sparsely in the matrix. Layer VI neurons do not arborize in the striatum but target principally the thalamus. The same corticothalamic axon can innervate the anterior, rostral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These findings support the concept that no corticofugal fiber system exists that is solely devoted to the striatum.

The prefrontal cortex also has a key role in suppressing irrelevant stimuli through a mechanism that is not well understood. Recent findings indicate that prefrontal pathways interface with laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons in sensory cortices, terminate extensively in the frontal and sensory sectors of the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus, and target the inhibitory intercalated masses of the amygdala.

Early-enucleated fetuses (operated prior to embryonic day 77) showed morphological changes at the level of the thalamus and the cortex. In the thalamus, there was a loss of lamination and a decrease in size of the lateral geniculate nucleus. There was a decrease in the size of the inferior pulvinar, but there was no change in the lateral pulvinar. The border of striate cortex was as sharp in the enucleates as it was in the normal monkeys. In three of the four early enucleates, we observed an interdigitation of striate and extrastriate cortex. In three of the early enucleates, we observed a small island of nonstriate cortex near the striate border that was surrounded entirely by striate cortex. Enucleation led to an age-related reduction of striate cortex. This reduction was greater in the operculum than in the calcarine fissure. The reduction of striate cortex was accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of extrastriate visual cortex, so that the overall dimensions of the neocortex remained invariant. The extrastriate cortex in the enucleated animals presented a uniform cytoarchitecture and was indistinguishable from area 18 in the normal animal. There were changes in the gyral pattern that were restricted mainly to the cortex on the operculum. A deepening of minor dimples as well as the induction of a variable number of supplementary sulci led to an increase in the convolution of the occipital lobe. These results are discussed with respect to the specification of cortical areas. They demonstrate that the reduction in striate cortex was not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the neocortex; rather, there was a border shift, and a large volume of cor tex that was destined to become striate cortex appears to be cytoarchitectonically normal extrastriate cortex.

For example, the supplementary motor area (SMA) is mainly involved in internally-triggered movements, whereas the premotor cortex (PM) is highly responsible for externally-guided movements. The primary motor cortex (M1) deals with both aspects of movements to execute a single motor behavior. To elucidate how the cortical motor system is structured to process a variety of information, the laminar distribution patterns of signals were examined between SMA and M1, or PM and M1 in macaque monkeys by using dual anterograde tract-tracing. Dense terminal labeling was observed in layers 1 and upper 2/3 of M1 after one tracer injection into SMA, another tracer injection into the dorsal division of PM resulted in prominent labeling in the deeper portion of layer 2/3. Weaker labeling was also visible in layer 5 in both cases. On the other hand, inputs from M1 terminated in both the superficial and the deep layers of SMA and PM. The present data indicate that distinct types of motor information are arranged in M1 in a layer-specific fashion to be orchestrated through a microcircuit within M1.;"[Ninomiya, Taihei; Inoue, Ken-ichi; Takada, Masahiko] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Ninomiya, Taihei; Hoshi, Eiji; Takada, Masahiko] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Ninomiya, Taihei] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Inoue, Ken-ichi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Hoshi, Eiji] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Frontal Lobe Funct Project, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1568506, Japan";"Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Physiological Sciences (NIPS); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science";"Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Syst Neurosci Sect, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan.;Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Tokyo 1020076, Japan.;Ninomiya, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Dev Physiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.";ninomiya@nips.ac.jp;Inoue, Ken-ichi/K-4103-2015;Inoue, Ken-ichi/0000-0002-5683-5280;"Cooperation Research Program of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University [2015-A-7]; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [16gm0310008h0206]";"Cooperation Research Program of the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST))";We thank T Kuroda and K Nagaya for technical assistance.

In the lateral LP nucleus, there are fewer glomerular arrangements, fewer GABAergic terminals, and fewer cholinergic terminals. Correspondingly, the neuropil of the lateral LP nucleus appears to be composed of a higher percentage of small type I cortical terminals (RS profiles). Similar to the pulvinar nucleus and the LGN, the cholinergic terminals present in the lateral LP nucleus contact both GABA-negative profiles (thalamocortical cells; 74%) and GABA-positive profiles (interneurons; 26%). However, in contrast to the pulvinar nucleus and the LGN, the majority of cholinergic terminals in the lateral LP nucleus contact small-caliber dendritic shafts outside of glomeruli (60 of 82; 73%). Consequently, most cholinergic terminals are in close proximity to RS profiles. Therefore, whereas the cholinergic input to the LGN and pulvinar nucleus appears to be positioned to selectively influence the response of thalamocortical cells to terminals that innervate glomeruli (retinal terminals or large type II cortical terminals), the cholinergic input to the lateral LP nucleus may function primarily in the modulation of responses to terminals that innervate distal dendrites (small type I cortical terminals).

It has been proposed that this circuit is involved in signal processing and thalamic sensitivity regulation. Alternatively, Crick has suggested that the circuit could be a reverberatory loop--a site for very short term (iconic) visual memory. This hypothesis is shown to be plausible if the reverberation is keyed to the onset of neurally initiated visual disruptions such as blinks and saccades. Neural mechanisms suppress perception during these events but little is known about temporal filling-in processes analogous to the mechanisms that fill-in spatial scotomas. Crick's reverberatory loop could provide a process for filling-in temporal scotomas with information acquired just before the disruption, thus maintaining the continuity of visual experience.

In addition, two modifications were identified that resulted in robust and reliable retrograde transport and EGFP expression after injection of the virus into three different brain regions in adult rats (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior thalamic nuclear group, and CA1). These are post-injection survival times of 14 days and addition of high concentrations of NaCl (>= 600 mM) to the injection buffer. These modifications resulted in obvious improvement in the intensity of the EGFP signal and in the number of labeled cells. Use of anti-EGFP in immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase processing further enhanced the signal so that Golgi-like filling of dendritic spines and axon collaterals was routinely achieved. Effectiveness of the AdSynEGFP for Golgi-like filling was confirmed in one rhesus monkey with injections in visual area V4. Because of the long-term viability of the infected neurons (at least up to 28 days in rats and 22 days in monkey), this AdSynEGFP is suitable for use in microcircuitry studies in combination with other fluorescently tagged elements, including anterogradely labeled extrinsic projections.
