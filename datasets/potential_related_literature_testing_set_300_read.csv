It is found that the apical dendrites of medium-sized and large pyramidal cells in layer V group together to form clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of about 56 mum. As these clusters ascend, the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer II/III are added to them. The thinner apical dendrites of the smaller pyramidal cells in layer VIa also form groups that are referred to as bundles. These bundles ascend, into layer IV independent of the clusters, and their arrangement suggests that the bundles are formed so that the apical dendrites of the layer VIa pyramids can pass between the groups of cell bodies of the layer V neurons. It is proposed that the clusters formed from the apical dendrites of the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells represent the axes of vertical modules of pyramidal cells, which represent the basic neuronal aggregates within area 17 of cat visual cortex. And it is suggested that these modules can be recruited in various combinations, most obviously by the excitation provided by the thalamic inputs, to form the functional columns, such as the ones that are concerned with eye preference and orientation. Based upon the distribution of the dendritic clusters, the pyramidal cell modules would have diameters of 56 mum, and since they are considered to extend through the depth of the cortex, each one would contain some 203 neurons. The striate cortex of one hemisphere contains 160,000 of these modules, which is about the same as the number of X-cells projecting to one hemisphere from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and twice the number of X- or beta-ganglion cells in the retina. The form of the pyramidal cell modules in cat striate cortex is compared to those present in monkey striate cortex, in which the similar modules are about 10 times more numerous, but only 31 mum in diameter (Peters and Sethares, 1991a)."",,NO,,D,,";;;

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system."",,NO,,D,,";;;

The pain was characterized as burning or icelike, and was associated with impairment of pin and temperature appreciation. Computed tomographic scanning showed that the common area of involvement in all cases was the white matter deep to both the caudal insula and the opercular region of the posterior parietal cortex. We suggest that disruption of the interconnections between these cerebral cortical areas (including the second somatosensory representation, SII) and the thalamus, particularly the intralaminar and ventroposterior nuclei, may be responsible for producing a thalamocortical disconnection syndrome with spontaneous pain as its clinical manifestation."",,NO,,D,,";;;

While it is known that primates have a complex array of 10 or more somatosensory areas that contribute to the analysis of sensory information from the hand, less is known about what cortical areas are involved in processing information from receptors of the tongue and teeth. The tongue contains taste receptors, as well as mechanoreceptors. Afferents from taste receptors and mechanoreceptors of the tongue access different ascending systems in the brainstem. However, it is uncertain how these two sources of information are processed in cortex. Here the parts of somatosensory areas 3b, 3a, and presumptive 1 that represent the mechanoreceptors of the teeth and tongue are identified, and evidence is presented that the representations of the tongue also get information from the taste nucleus of the thalamus, VPMpc. As areas 3b, 3a, and 1 project to other areas of somatosensory cortex, and those areas to additional areas, some or all of the currently defined somatosensory areas of cortex may be involved in processing gustatory, as well as tactile, information from the tongue and thus have a role in the biologically important function of evaluating food in the mouth.

He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' Swiss period (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called supplementary motor area was rather a supramotor area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether [C-11]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylamino-methyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ([C-11]DASB) binding to the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) in the rhesus monkey and rat brain decreased after a pharmacologically-induced increase in the interstitial serotonin (5HT) concentration. Three rhesus monkeys were given repeated single boluses of [C-11]DASB in sequential positron emission tomography (PET) experiments. Rats were given the tracer as a bolus dose plus a constant infusion. In vivo binding in both models was studied before and after presumably having increased interstitial 5HT concentrations using tranylcypromine (TCP), which inhibits the enzyme (monoamine oxidase, MAO), that degrades 5HT. The rat brain tissue was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the proportion of the PET signal comprising unchanged [C-11]DASB. The binding of [C-11]DASB in the thalamus decreased in both rhesus monkeys and rats after TCP administration. The possibility of using [C-11]DASB as a tool for monitoring changes in endogenous serotonin concentrations merits further investigation."",,NO,,D,,";;;

II. Effect of muscimol inactivation of the caudal fastigial nucleus,""The medioposterior cerebellum [vermian lobules VI and VII and caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN)] is known to play a major role in the control of saccadic gaze shifts toward a visual target. To determine the relative contribution of the cFN efferent pathways to the brainstem reticular formation and to the superior colliculus (SC), we recorded in the head-unrestrained cat the effects of cFN unilateral inactivation on gaze shifts evoked by electrical microstimulation of the deeper SC layers. Gaze shifts evoked after muscimol injection still exhibited the typical qualitative features of normal saccadic gaze shifts. Nevertheless, consistent modifications in amplitude and latency were observed. For ipsiversive movements (evoked by the SC contralateral to the inactivated cFN), these changes depended on the locus of stimulation on the motor map: for the anterior 2/3 of the SC, amplitude increased and latency tended to decrease"; for the posterior 1/3 of the SC, amplitude decreased and latency increased. For the contraversive direction, amplitude moderately decreased and latency tended to increase for all but the caudal-most stimulated SC site. These modifications of SC-evoked gaze shifts during cFN inactivation differed from the ipsiversive hypermetria/contraversive hypometria pattern observed for visually triggered gaze shifts recorded during the same recording sessions. We conclude that (i) the topographical organization of gaze shift amplitude in the deeper SC layers is influenced by the cerebellum and is either severely distorted or demonstrates an amplitude reduction during inactivation of the contralateral or ipsilateral cFN, respectively;" (ii) gaze shifts evoked by SC microstimulation and visually triggered gaze shifts either rely on distinct cerebellar-dependent control processes or differ by the location of the caudal-most active SC population. We present a functional scheme providing several predictions regarding the modulatory influence of the cerebellum on SC neuronal activities and on the topographical organization of fastigial-SC projections."",,NO,,R,,cat";

Intense staining for both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was observed in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons in this nucleus. In comparison to GluR1, less intense staining for GluR2/3 was observed in the cell bodies and processes. NMDAR1 immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies and large numbers of small diameter dendrites. Light staining was observed in cell bodies with mGluR1a and no staining was observed on cell bodies with mGluR5. The neuropil, however, contained many processes that were labeled for mGluR1a or mGluR5. Electron microscopy showed that label was present in cytoplasmic locations in cell bodies and dendrites, in addition to components of the synaptic region, in sections stained for GluR1, GluR2/3 and NMDAR1. In contrast, very lightly labeled or unlabeled cell bodies but labeled dendrites and axon terminals, was observed in sections stained for mGluR1a and mGluR5. In addition to neural processes, occasional astrocytic processes were also labeled for mGluR5. Of the immunogold particles that were associated with components of the synaptic region, label for ionotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present on postsynaptic densities, whilst that for metabotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present in a perisynaptic location. The ratio of GluR1/GluR2 messenger RNAs has been reported to increase in the aged hippocampus (PAGLIUSI, S. R., GERRARD, P., ABDALLAH, M., TALABOT, D. & CATSICAS, S. (1994) Neuroscience 61, 429-433.), and it is possible that a similar change in the ratio of GluR1 and GluR2 may occur in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus with age.

These precerebellar nuclei, in turn, receive a feedback projection from the cerebellar nuclei, which mostly originate in the lateral nucleus (LN). It has been suggested that the feedback projection from the LN partially uses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a transmitter. We tested this hypothesis by using a combination of anterograde tracing (biotinylated dextran amine injection into the LN) and postembedding GABA and glutamate immunogold histochemistry. The pattern of labeling in the PN and the NRTP was compared with that of cerebellonuclear terminals in two other target structures, the parvocellular part of the nucleus ruber (RNp) and the ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamus (VM/VL). The projection to the inferior olive (IO), which is known to be predominantly GABAergic, served as a control. A quantitative analysis of the synaptic terminals labeled by the tracer within the PN, the NRTP, and the VL/VM revealed no GABA immunoreactivity. Only one clearly labeled terminal was found in the RNp. In contrast, 72% of the terminals in the IO were clearly GABA immunoreactive, confirming the reliability of our staining protocol. Correspondingly, glutamate immunohistochemistry labeled the majority of the cerebellonuclear terminals in the PN (88%), the NRTP (90%), the RNp (93%), and the VM/VL (63%) but labeled only 5% in the IO. These data do not support a role for GABAergic inhibition either in the feedback systems from the LN to the PN and the NRTP or within the projections to the RNp and the VM/VL.

The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity.

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception, often by making the sound seem louder, the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review, we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g., what circuits underlie multisensory convergence), and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g., what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact, it seems that the question is no longer whether low level, putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences, but how.

In turn, the posterior parietal areas send projections to the frontal primary motor and premotor areas. This cortical pathway is hypothesized to be involved in the transformation of a visual input into the appropriate motor output. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the entire brain to determine the patterns of activation that occurred while subjects performed a visually guided motor task. In nine human subjects, fMRI data were acquired on a 4-T whole-body MR system equipped with a head gradient coil and a birdcage RF coil using a T-2*-weighted EPI sequence. Functional activation was determined for three different tasks: (1) a visuomotor task consisting of moving a cursor on a screen with a joystick in relation to various targets, (2) a hand movement task consisting of moving the joystick without visual input, and (3) a eye movement task consisting of moving the eyes alone without visual input. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-based activation maps of each subject were generated using period cross-correlation statistics. Subsequently, each subject's brain was normalized to Talairach coordinates, and the individual maps were compared on a pixel by pixel basis. Significantly activated pixels common to at least four out of six subjects were retained to construct the final functional image. The pattern of activation during visually guided movements was consistent with the flow of information from striate and extrastriate visual areas, to the posterior parietal complex, and then to frontal motor areas. The extensive activation of this network and the reproducibility among subjects is consistent with a role for the dorsal stream in transforming visual information into motor behavior. Also extensively activated were the medial and lateral cerebellar structures, implicating the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway in visually guided movements. Thalamic activation, particularly of the pulvinar, suggests that this nucleus is an important subcortical target of the dorsal stream.

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images providing a novel and accurate way of measuring very fine and local functional differences.

In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored. Methodology: We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of mu-opioid receptors. Principal Findings: In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with mu-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[C-11] methyl] buprenorphine ([C-11]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition. Conclusions: Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research."",,NO,fMRI,R,NO,";;;

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

We made extracellular recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone.

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques."",,NO,Behaviour,A,NO,Effects of AcH in food selection";;;

Some studies have suggested that functional and structural impairments in the default mode network may play a role in explaining these disorders. In contrast, others have proposed that dysfunctions in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit involving striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus may be the main underlying mechanism. Here, we provide the first report of structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting the nodes of the mesocircuit and the default mode network in 8 patients with DOC. We found evidence of significant damage to subcortico-cortical and cortico-cortical fibers, which were more severe in vegetative state patients and correlated with clinical severity as determined by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. In contrast, fiber tracts interconnecting subcortical nodes were not significantly impaired. Lastly, we found significant damage in all fiber tracts connecting the precuneus with cortical and subcortical areas. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the default mode network and most importantly the precuneus - and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the neural basis of the DOC.

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

We injected rabies into the primary motor cortex (M1) or into Area 46 of cebus monkeys. A 4-day survival time was long enough to allow transport of rabies from the injection site to 'third-order' neurons in the basal ganglia. After either MI or Area 46 injections, third-order neurons were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). In each of these nuclei, the third-order neurons that innervate M1 were spatially separated from those that innervate Area 46. Thus, distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits innervate M1 and Area 46. Next, we injected a conventional tracer into M1 to define its terminations in the putamen and STN. We found that the regions of the putamen and STN that receive input from M1 are the same as those that contain third-order neurons after M1 injections of virus. On the other hand, virus injections into M1 also labeled a relatively dense group of third-order neurons in a region of the ventral putamen that is not innervated by M1. This region of the putamen is the target of efferents from the amygdala. Thus, the ventral putamen may provide a route for the limbic system to influence motor output. Overall, our results indicate that basal ganglia circuits with the cerebral cortex can be characterized by both open- and closed-loop macro-architectures."",,NO,TT,A,NO,""Perfect type of study, but in Cebus monkey""";;;

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that testosterone increases neural activity in the amygdala. To investigate whether this could be due to altered regulation of amygdala functioning which is thought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, we studied the effects of exogenous testosterone on the interaction between the amygdala and other brain regions. Healthy middle-aged women received a single nasal testosterone dose in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover manner, and performed an emotional face matching task while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI. The results show that testosterone rapidly reduced functional coupling of the amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex, and enhanced amygdala coupling with the thalamus. This suggests that testosterone may reduce the regulatory control over the amygdala, or that testosterone shifts amygdala output away from the orbitofrontal cortex towards the thalamus. Testosterone also reduced functional coupling with the contralateral amygdala. Because interhemispheric amygdala coupling is lower in men than in women, this result suggests that circulating testosterone may contribute to this sexual dimorphism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the impact of amblyopia on the white matter within the visual system. We studied the properties of six major visual white-matter pathways in a group of adults with amblyopia (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 10) using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography. While we did not find significant differences in diffusion properties in cortico-cortical pathways, patients with amblyopia exhibited increased mean diffusivity in thalamo-cortical visual pathways.

Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by reinnervation of denervated targets by regenerating injured axons or by collateral branching Of undamaged axons, and remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of adequate tat-get reinnervation";" however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, Such as neuropathic pain and hyperreflexia. After axotomy, neurons shift from a transmitter to a regenerative phenotype, activating molecular pathways that promote neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Peripheral nerve injuries also induce a cascade of events, at the Molecular, cellular, and system levels, initiated by the injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, thalamus, and brain cortex. Mechanisms involved in these changes include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of sensory and motor central maps. An important direction for research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, and are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying positive adaptive changes that improve functional recovery and also reducing undesirable effects."",,NO,Lesion,A,YES,Book/review";;

In the tectorotundal system, neurons of the stratum griseum centrale (SGC) of the optic tectum send their axons bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt). In transit to the Rt, the axons of the SGC neurons collateralize in the nuclei posteroventralis thalami (PV), subpretectalis (SP), and interstitiopretectosubpretectalis (IPS) of the tectothalamic tract (TT). The current study used birthdating and pathway-tracing methods to investigate the neurogenesis and time course of neuronal connections of the tectorotundal pathway in chicks during embryogenesis. By using tritiated thymidine autoradiography, we observed that the SGC neurons of the tectum were generated by embryonic days 3.0-5.5 (E3.0-E5.5), the Rt by E3.5-E5.0, and the nuclei of TT by E3.5-4.5. To trace the tectorotundal pathway, we injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into the tectum, and the CTb-like immunoreactivity was examined. By E4.5-E5.5, some CTb-like immunoreactive (CTb-LI) axons terminated in the ipsilateral SP/IPS. By E6.0-E6.5, CTb-LI axon bundles were seen ipsilaterally in the TT. Increased numbers of labeled axons were seen terminating in the SP/IPS. By E7.0-E7.5, heavily labeled axons in the TT were observed with diffuse terminals in areas ventral to the presumptive Rt and PV. By E7.5-E8.0, the tectal axons innervated the ipsilateral Rt, in which some of the collaterals crossed the midline to the contralateral diencephalon. The crossed tectorotundal projection was seen first by E8.0-E8.5. Also, during this stage, a few CTb-LI collaterals terminated in the contralateral SP/IPS. Between E10 and. E13, the pattern of bilateral tectorotundal projections became more regionalized, whereas labeling continued to increase in the SP/IPS. At E16, the labeling pattern of all tectorecipient structures resembled that of the hatchling. The current study revealed the temporal order of development of the tectorotundal pathway during embryogenesis. The SGC cells first innervate ipsilaterally the SP/IPS and then the Rt/PV. The schedule of the crossed tectorotundal connections coincides with the schedule of tectal projections onto the contralateral intrinsic nuclei of the TT. We conclude that E8.0 (+/-E0.5) is a critical stage for the development of the tectofugal pathway. Moreover, the current study provides important insights into the relative ontogeny of the mammalian tectofugal pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:115-132, 2000.

To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas."",,NO,,A,NO,""Dynamics, not structure""";;;

Many extrinsic cortical connections also form columnar terminations, but less is known about their fine organization. Results from intracellular injections of neighboring neurons (in rats: Johnson et al., 2000) suggest that even neurons within a common domain may have non-stereotyped projection patterns, with only partial overlap of terminal arbors. The issue of non-stereotyped projections at the columnar level is further considered by analysis of V1 axons terminating in primate area MT/V5 (an early visual area), and of an axon from temporal cortex terminating in area 7b (a higher cortical area). Both these axons have multiple non-uniform arbors. The implication is that each arbor recruits different numbers and possibly different combinations of postsynaptic elements.

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds)."",,NO,,D,,";;;

In the striatum, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the rostroventral half of the putamen and is characterized by enhanced matriceal PV and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (4). The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the caudate nucleus (Cd) and rostral putamen (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal CB-ir. The third and fourth territories M and T4) comprise rostroventral parts of Cd and PuT characterized by complementary patch/matrix distributions of CB- and CR-ir, and the accumbens nucleus (Acb), respectively. The latter is separated into lateral (prominently enhanced in CB-ir) and medial (prominently enhanced in CR-ir) subdivisions. In the pallidum, parallel gradients also delimit four territories, T1 in the caudal half of external (GPe) and internal (GPi) divisions, characterized by enhanced PV- and SMI-32-ir"; T2 in their rostral half, characterized by enhanced CB-ir;" and T3 and T4 in their rostroventral pole and in the subpallidal area, respectively, both expressing CB- and CR-ir but with different intensities. The subthalamic nucleus (STh) shows contrasting patterns of dense PV-ir (sparing only the most medial part) and low CB-ir. Expression of CR-ir is relatively low, except in the medial, low PV-ir, part of the nucleus, whereas SMI-32-ir is moderate across the whole nucleus, The substantia nigra is characterized by complementary patterns of high neuropil CB- and SMI-32-ir in pars reticulata (SNr and high CR-ir in pars compacta (SNc) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The compartmentalization of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32 in the human basal ganglia, in particular in the striatum and pallidum, delimits anatomofunctional territories that are of significance for functional imaging studies and target selection in stereotactic neurosurgery.

Noting their connections with the basal ganglia, the locomotor disturbances that occur following lesions of the PPN or cMRF, and the encouraging results of PPN deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, both the PPN and cMRF have been linked to motor control. In order to determine the existence of and characterize vestibular responses in the PPN and cMRF, we recorded single neurons from both structures during vertical and horizontal rotation, translation, and visual pursuit stimuli. The majority of PPN cells (72.5%) were vestibular-only (VO) cells that responded exclusively to rotation and translation stimuli but not visual pursuit. Visual pursuit responses were much more prevalent in the cMRF (57.1%) though close to half of cMRF cells were VO cells (41.1%). Directional preferences also differed between the PPN, which was preferentially modulated during nose-down pitch, and cMRF, which was preferentially modulated during ipsilateral yaw rotation. Finally, amplitude responses were similar between the PPN and cMRF during rotation and pursuit stimuli, but PPN responses to translation were of higher amplitude than cMRF responses. Taken together with their connections to the vestibular circuit, these results implicate the PPN and cMRF in the processing of vestibular stimuli and suggest important roles for both in responding to motion perturbations like falls and turns.

It is now clear that higher primates have four strip-like representations of skin and muscle receptors corresponding to areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2 of anterior parietal cortex. Areas 3 b and 1 receive cutaneous information from the ventroposterior nucleus, while a ventroposterior superior nucleus provides areas 3 a and 2 with information from muscle receptors. Area 3 b is the homolog of S-I in prosimians and non-primates and it provides most of the activating cutaneous inputs to areas 1 and 2. Most of the further processing that allows tactile recognition of objects involves somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus, where both S-II and the parietal ventral area (PV) receive activating inputs from areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2. S-II also projects to PV and to a parietal rostral area where further connections with the amygdala and hippocampus may occur to allow the formation of tactile memories. Areas of anterior parietal cortex also project to posterior parietal cortex, where regions of cortex are largely somatosensory, but the functional subdivisions remain uncertain. All of the somatosensory fields have access to motor areas of the frontal lobe, but the magnitude and targets of the projections differ."",,YES,,R,YES,Review article about somatosensory cortex.

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer, leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN, almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast, following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN, labeled cells were found in both tiers, with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus, layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN: an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers."",,YES,TT,R,NO,corticogeniculate => layer 6 of V1";;;

Recently, molecular biological techniques have enabled us to find rare types of genes expressed in specific neocortical areas. We previously reported occ1 gene as preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex (V1), using the differential display method. Here, by differential display, we found selective and strong expression of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene, in higher-order association areas. In V1, RBP mRNA was expressed only in the superficial part of layer II, but its expression increased, involving deeper layers, along the visual pathway. In visual association areas such as TE, RBP mRNA was strongly expressed in both supra- and infragranular layers. In primary auditory and somatosensory areas, as in V1, RBP expression was low, and restricted to the upper part of the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of RBP expression is in marked contrast with that of occ1";" and in early visual areas where both genes are expressed, these occur in distinct sublayers within the supragranular layers. In neonatal monkeys, the area-specific expression pattern of RBP was less distinct, suggesting that the characteristic expression of RBP in higher-order association areas is mainly established postnatally."",,NO,,R,,retinol-binding protein";;

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 40-Hz-selective responses in the cerebellar Crus II auditory region could be explained by frequency-specific enabling of interactions in the auditory cortico-cerebellar-thalamic loop.

This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.

The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using O-15-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."",,NO,PET,R,,";;;
