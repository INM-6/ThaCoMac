Crossed fronto-thalamic axons reach more lateral regions than those containing contralateral thalamo-frontal neurons.

Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus.",C1V1; ChR2; motor cortex; motor thalamus; optogenetics; single unit recording; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; FINE-STRUCTURE; RELAY NUCLEI

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.

Anterograde and retrograde labeling patterns in the thalamus were charted and individual labeled axons traced in continuous serial sections. Both anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus was extensive, spanning several millimeters mediolaterally and including ventral lateral, ventral anterior, centromedian, and centrolateral nuclei. Paracentral, mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and medial pulvinar nuclei were also labeled. Two basic types of corticothalamic axons were identified: small to medium-width, type 1 axons that formed large terminal fields with small boutons, and thick, type 2 axons that formed small terminal fields with large boutons. Within each group, subtypes were identified based on specific features of the axons and terminals: two subtypes of type 1 axons and four subtypes of type 2 axons. The results revealed multiple modes of corticothalamic connectivity: sparsely distributed type I axons, dense plexuses of type 1 axons, type 2 axon terminal fields either singly or in clusters, and mixed plexuses of type 1 and type 2 axons. Only some cells in the plexuses were retrogradely labeled; some plexuses did not contain any labeled neurons, and many retrogradely labeled neurons were in the regions devoid of anterograde labeling. These connectivity patterns differed between thalamic nuclei. The results revealed much more complex relationships between M1 and thalamus than were previously thought to exist. It is suggested that this connectivity is neither of exclusively a feedback nature nor perfectly reciprocal but is subserved by a multitude of channels, most likely originating from different populations of cortical neurons, and feeding into a variety of functionally different neuronal networks, with each processing specific information.

(1990). HRP was injected into various regions of the cortex in different animals and hemispheres (see Fig. 1), and plots were made of the retrogradely stained thalamic projection neurons. The thalamocortical projection is virtually identical in both rodent species. It is topological throughout in that nearby cortical injections label nearby, though overlapping cell groups in the thalamus. Cortical injections in a rostro-caudal progression labelled thalamic projection zones on top of each other, layered like tiles on a roof or fish scales, beginning in the rostromedial and ending in the caudo-dorsal thalamus. The progression vector of thalamic zones projecting successively from more rostral to more caudal cortical zones is twisted and turns from a predominantly mediolateral direction in the anterior thalamus to an essentially ventro-dorsal direction in the posterior thalamus (Figs. 8 and 9). In the marmoset, the thalamo-cortical topography follows the same topological rule, with the exception of the lateral geniculate body which is translocated latero-ventrally and separated from the rest of the thalamus as in all primates. This suggests a general thalamo-cortical mapping rule common to all mammals which can be related to gradients and timing of cell birth in the thalamus. It is proposed that this mapping rule is the consequence of successive appositions of neurons in the medio-ventral thalamus during ontogenetic development.",THALAMOCORTICAL TOPOGRAPHY; TOPOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION; MARMOSET; COMPARATIVE ANATOMY; RODENTS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; THALAMO-CORTICAL PROJECTION; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; MOTOR CORTEX

Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and different parts of the prefrontal cortex are essential in cognitive processes, such as learning and adaptive decision-making. Cortico-thalamocortical interactions involving other dorsal thalamic nuclei, including the anterior thalamus and pulvinar, also influence these cognitive processes. Our work, and that of others, indicates a crucial influence of these interdependent cortico-thalamocortical neural networks that contributes actively to the processing of information within the cortex. Each of these thalamic nuclei also receives potent subcortical inputs that are likely to provide additional influences on their regulation of cortical activity. Here, we highlight our current neuroscientific research aimed at establishing when cortico-MD thalamocortical neural network communication is vital within the context of a rapid learning and memory discrimination task. We are collecting evidence of MD-prefrontal cortex neural network communication in awake, behaving male rhesus macaques. Given the prevailing evidence, further studies are needed to identify both broad and specific mechanisms that govern how the MD, anterior thalamus and pulvinar cortico-thalamocortical interactions support learning, memory and decision-making. Current evidence shows that the MD (and the anterior thalamus) are crucial for frontotemporal communication, and the pulvinar is crucial for frontoparietal communication. Such work is crucial to advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical and physiological bases of these brain functions in humans. In turn, this might offer avenues to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the cognitive deficits often observed in many debilitating neurological disorders and diseases and in neurodegeneration.",anterior thalamus; behaviour; decision making; mediodorsal thalamus; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; prefrontal cortex; pulvinar; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PULVINAR INACTIVATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MEDIAL THALAMUS; LESIONS; AMYGDALA; PROJECTIONS; SELECTION; DISCONNECTION

The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation. The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions. Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere-the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated. There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion. This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere. The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric nystagmus or perceived body motion. Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways. Furthermore, the normal interaction between the two sensory systems-the vestibular and the visual-appears to be impaired.",vestibular system; thalamic lesion; PET; imaging; thalamo-cortical system; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; CALORIC STIMULATION; HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE; GALVANIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL PROJECTION

Glutamatergic inputs to these cells arise predominantly from corticothalamic (in both basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving ventral motor thalamic territories; BGMT and CBMT, respectively) and cerebellothalamic terminals (in CBMT). In Parkinson's disease patients and animal models, neuronal activity is abnormal within both BGMT and CBMT. Historically, such motor thalamic dysregulation has been largely attributed to changes in inhibitory tone from the basal ganglia output nuclei, ignoring the potential role of other thalamic inputs in such processes, particularly within the CBMT, which is largely devoid of direct basal ganglia afferents. We have recently reported changes in the abundance and structural morphology of corticothalamic terminals in BGMT of parkinsonian monkeys. In this study, we assessed potential changes in the prevalence of cortical (vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive, vGluT1-positive) and subcortical (vGluT2-positive) glutamatergic inputs in contact with GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CBMT of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. Our findings revealed that interneurons represent a major target of both sets of glutamatergic terminals. In both BGMT and CBMT of control and parkinsonian monkeys, 29%-38% of total asymmetric axodendritic synapses (putative glutamatergic) were formed by vGluT1-positive terminals and 11%-17% of total vGluT1-positive terminals targeted dendrites of GABAergic interneurons. In CBMT, 16%-18% of asymmetric synaptic inputs on interneurons involved vGluT2-containing terminals. No major differences in the extent of glutamatergic innervation of thalamic GABAergic interneurons were found between control and parkinsonian monkeys.",cerebellothalamic; corticothalamic; Parkinson's disease; primate; thalamic interneurons; ventral motor thalamus; DORSAL LATERAL GENICULATE; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; FINE-STRUCTURE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; IMMUNOREACTIVE INTERNEURONS; MAGNOCELLULAR SUBDIVISION; RETINAL TERMINALS; NUCLEUS VAMC; CELL-TYPES; INNERVATION

We explored the neuroanatomic distribution of ERK immunoreactivity in the rhesus monkey brain. The hippocampal formation, especially the messy fiber zone and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are the most heavily immunostained areas. Cerebral cortex is, in general, more intensely stained in the supragranular layers.

Retrograde tracing studies revealed that whisker-related VL neurons were found relatively anterior and medial to those labeled following injection of retrograde tracer into hindpaw motor areas. Simultaneous injections of fluorescent microspheres in both cortical regions did not result in double-labeled neurons in VL. Quantitative analysis of dendritic and somatic morphologies did not reveal any differences between hindpaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons within VL. The morphology of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL is similar to those in other mammals and suggests that mouse can be used as a model system for studying thalamocortical transformations within the motor system as well as plasticity following sensory deprivation or enrichment.</.",thalamus; ventral lateral thalamus; whiskers; somatotopy; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; PROJECTION NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; RAT; INPUT; NUCLEUS; CAT; CONNECTIONS; PREMOTOR

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits.

These cortical subpopulations display different axonal outgrowth kinetics and innervate distinct thalamic nuclei in a temporal pattern determined by cortical layer identity and subclass specificity. Guidance by molecular cues, structural cues, and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to this development. There is a substantial rearrangement of the corticofugal connectivity outside the thalamus at the border of and within the reticular thalamic nucleus, a region that shares some of the characteristics of the cortical subplate during development. The early transient circuits are not well understood, nor the extent to which this developmental pattern may be driven by peripheral sensory activity.

Detailed anatomy and functional connectivity patterns of the thalamocortical system are essential to understanding the cortical organization and pathophysiology of a wide range of thalamus-related neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The current study used resting-state fMRI to investigate the topography of the human thalamocortical system from a functional perspective. The thalamus-related cortical networks were identified by performing independent component analysis on voxel-based thalamic functional connectivity maps across a large group of subjects. The resulting functional brain networks were very similar to well-established resting-state network maps. Using these brain network components in a spatial regression model with each thalamic voxel's functional connectivity map, we localized the thalamic subdivisions related to each brain network. For instance, the medial dorsal nucleus was shown to be associated with the default mode, the bilateral executive, the medial visual networks; and the pulvinar nucleus was involved in both the dorsal attention and the visual networks. These results revealed that a single nucleus may have functional connections with multiple cortical regions or even multiple functional networks, and may be potentially related to the function of mediation or modulation of multiple cortical networks. This observed organization of thalamocortical system provided a reference for studying the functions of thalamic sub-regions.

Thalamocortical neurons in most of these nuclei are modulated by the affective and cognitive signals which funnel through the basal ganglia. We review how PFC-connected thalamic nuclei likely contribute to all aspects of cognitive control: from the processing of information on internal states and goals, facilitating its interactions with mnemonic information and learned values of stimuli and actions, to their influence on high-level cognitive processes, attentional allocation and goaldirected behavior. This includes contributions to transformations such as rule-to-choice (parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus), value-to-choice (magnocellular mediodorsal nucleus), mnemonic-to-choice (anteromedial nucleus) and sensory-to-choice (medial pulvinar). Common mechanisms appear to be thalamic modulation of cortical gain and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. The anatomy also implies a unique role for medial PFC in modulating processing in thalamocortical circuits involving other orbital and lateral PFC regions.

However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9-17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

MMN is thought to represent a comparison of the features of the present stimulus versus a mnemonic template formed by the prior stimuli. METHODS: We used concurrent thalamic and primary auditory cortical (A1) laminar recordings in 7 macaques to evaluate the relative contributions of core (lemniscal) and matrix (nonlemniscal) thalamic afferents to MMN generation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that deviance-related activity is observed mainly in matrix regions of auditory thalamus, MMN generators are most prominent in layer 1 of cortex as opposed to sensory responses that activate layer 4 first and sequentially all cortical layers, and MMN is elicited independent of the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles. Consistent with prior reports, MMN-related thalamocortical activity was strongly inhibited by ketamine.

However, injections in the motor area resulted in retrograde and anterograde labelling of nuclei in both the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus. These nuclei included the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the intralaminar nuclei (ILN), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and midline nuclei. Large unilateral injections located mainly laterally in the thalamus labelled cells, contralaterally, in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus but never in VL, ILN and MD.

Methods: Thirty minutes before intraperitoneal induction of SE by Coriaria lactone (CL), rhesus monkeys were treated with LEV (15 or 150 mg/kg) delivered intravenously as a single bolus. CL dose and epileptic behavior were recorded. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before and during the experiment. All rhesus monkeys were killed after 1-month video monitoring and processed for pathological investigation of neuronal injury, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. Results: No animal exhibited spontaneous seizures during 1-month video monitoring. Development of acute SE was significantly inhibited in the group given 150 mg/kg LEV, compared with controls and the 15 mg/kg LEV group. Delayed latency, reduction of SE duration, decreased cumulative time of tonic convulsions, slight severity of SE, and a high CL induction dose were observed in the high LEV dose group (p < 0.05). The EEG showed less frequent epileptic discharges in the group administered with 150 mg/kg LEV. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, ultrastructural examination, TUNEL and GFAP staining revealed serious damage, including neuron loss, swollen mitochondrion, and strong positivity for TUNEL in the hippocampus and thalamus of controls, whereas moderate damage in the group administered with 15 mg/kg LEV, and very mild damage in the 150 mg/kg LEV group. Gliosis was found in the hippocampus of controls, not in the LEV groups and normal rhesus monkey.

In three macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we observed up to five finger-like protrusions that emanated from the posterior pole of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extended posteriorly between the lateral pulvinar and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. These anomalous fingers measured up to 1.7 mm in length and contained dense accumulations of neurons and glia. The fingers received a direct retinal input from the contralateral eye indicating that they were part of the LGN rather than of other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In order to determine with which subcompartment(s) of the LGN the fingers were associated (parvocellular, magnocellular, or intercalated layers), we examined the immunochemical properties and size of neurons in the fingers and LGN subcompartments. We concluded that the fingers were not associated with the intercalated layers, since neurons in the fingers did not stain with an antibody to calbindin-D28k, whereas intercalated neurons stained intensely with this antibody. In addition, neurons located in the fingers were significantly smaller than those found in the magnocellular layers but were not significantly different in size from neurons in the parvocellular layers. We therefore consider that the fingers are an anomaly of the parvocellular subcompartment of the LGN. Interestingly, in two of the three cases with anomalous fingers, we also observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae, suggesting that these two anomalies were related. In five additional animals, however, we observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae without anomalous fingers. Thus, if there are common mechanisms underlying the development of both anomalous fingers and subsidiary layers, our data indicate that they do not always result in the concomitant expression of both anomalies.","thalamus; lamination; retinal projections; (primates) monkey, Macaca fascicularis; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; MONOCULAR ENUCLEATION; RETINAL PROJECTIONS; PULVINAR NUCLEUS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-SYSTEM; PATTERNS; IMMUNOREACTIVITY"

Here we demonstrate temporally induced elevation of visual responsiveness in cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cat and monkey following a period of high intensity (elevated contrast) stimulation. This augmentation is seen in 40-70% (monkey-cat) of cells tested and of all subtypes. Peaking at similar to 3 min following the period of intense stimulation, it can last for 10-12 min and can be repeated and summed in time. Furthermore, it is dependent on corticofugal input, is seen even when high contrast stimuli of orthogonal orientation are used and therefore results from a/any prior increase in activity in the retino-geniculo-striate pathway. We suggest that this reflects a general mechanism for control of visual responsiveness; both a flexible and dynamic means of changing effectiveness of thalamic activity as visual input changes, but also a mechanism which is an emergent property of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop.",context dependent; contrast mediated; cortico-geniculate; response enhancement; thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; RABBIT FOLLOWING STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; AUGMENTING RESPONSES; LASTING POTENTIATION; PERFORANT PATH; DENTATE AREA; CORTEX

Area 46 has complex connections with somatosensory, visual, visuomotor, motor, and limbic systems and a key role in cognition, which frequently declines with age. An important question is what alterations might account for this decline. We are nowhere near having a complete answer, but as will be shown in this review, it is now evident that there is no single underlying cause. There is no significant loss of cortical neurons and although there are a few senile plaques in rhesus monkey cortex, their frequency does not correlate with cognitive decline. However, as discussed in this review, the following do correlate with cognitive decline. Loss of white matter has been proposed to result in some disconnections between parts of the central nervous system and changes in the structure of myelin sheaths reduce conduction velocity and the timing in neuronal circuits. In addition, there are reductions in the inputs to cortical neurons, as shown by regression of dendritic trees, loss of dendritic spines and synapses, and alterations in transmitters and receptors. These factors contribute to alterations in the intrinsic and network physiological properties of cortical neurons. As more details emerge, it is to be hoped that effective interventions to retard cognitive decline can be proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI

This study attempts to identify the correlation between thalamic relay cells and functional activity evoked in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) of cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys. Wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA:HRP) was iontophoretically injected into physiologically determined sites in the somatosensory cortex, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminals in corresponding somatosensory thalamic regions. In the same animals, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) experiments were carried out 2 days later, using the somatic stimuli identified as best exciting the cortical neurons. Stimulation to the limbs produced crescent-shaped clusters of metabolic label arranged in a somatotopically organized fashion in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Following WGA:HRP injections into area 3b, the stimulus-evoked 2DG label was colocalized with the retrograde and anterograde tracer. This finding suggests that the location of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity can be predicted by the presence of transported WGA:HRP clusters.",SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; WGA-HRP; 2-DEOXYGLUCOSE; CYTOCHROME OXIDASE; THALAMIC ROD; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VENTROBASAL COMPLEX; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; THALAMUS; HISTOCHEMISTRY; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTION; MACAQUE

In this paper this issue is addressed by investigating the connectivity pattern of a brain structure with many, well characterized structural connections, namely the thalamus. Diffusion-weighted and resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected in a group of 38 healthy participants. Probabilistic tractography was performed to parcellate the thalamus into regions structurally connected to different cortical areas. The resulting regions were used as seeds for seed-based analysis of RS fMRI data. The tractographic parcellation was thus cross-validated against functional connectivity data by evaluating the overlap between the functional and structural thalamo-cortical connections originating from the parcellated regions. Our data show only a partial overall correspondence between structural and functional connections, in the same group of healthy individuals, thus suggesting that the two approaches provide complementary and not overlapping information. Future studies are warranted to extend the results we obtained in the thalamus to other structures, and to confirm that the mechanisms behind functional connectivity are more complex than just expressing structural connectivity.",Resting-state fMRI; Tractography; Diffusion; Thalamo-cortical connections; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NETWORKS; MRI; SEGMENTATION; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL

Neurosurgeons mostly use the stereotactic atlas of Schaltenbrand with Hassler's nomenclature of the thalamus. Neuroanatomists use different nomenclatures for the primate thalamus. The cytoarchitectonic definition of nuclei is difficult in the motor thalamus. and it would be best to define the nuclei based on their subcortical afferents. However, tracing studies are not available in humans. Thus, human thalamic nomenclature is based entirely on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and transfer of knowledge by analogy from monkey to man. Problems arise when trying to transfer the detailed knowledge from monkey to the human brain. By doing so, different authors have come to different conclusions concerning the subcortical afferents of Hassler's motor nuclei, which inevitably leads to confusion when attempting neurophysiological interpretations of the surgical data. The present review draws attention to the discrepancies and open questions in the literature. There is a need to better define the limits of the sensory and cerebellar afferent receiving thalamic nuclei as well as those of the cerebellar and pallidal afferent receiving territories in humans.

After tracer injections in the mediodorsal nuclei on either side, neurons were retrogradely labeled in all the areas of the contralateral prefrontal cortex in which ipsilateral labeling was also observed. Contralateral corticothalamic cells accounted for 15% of the labeled neurons in the orbital and agranular insular areas, while their proportion was lower (3%) in the anterior cingulate cortex. Up to 70% of the contralateral cortical neurons were double labeled by bilateral injections in the mediodorsal nuclei. At the electron microscopic level, unilateral injections of biotinylated dextran-amine in the orbitofrontal cortex resulted in anterograde labeling of small terminals and a few large boutons in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus, while only small boutons were identified contralaterally. The diameter of postsynaptic dendritic profiles contacted by labeled small cortical endings was significantly larger in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus than contralaterally. These findings demonstrate that dense contralateral cortical projections to the mediodorsal nucleus derive from the orbital and agranular insular areas, and that crossed corticothalamic afferents are mostly formed by collaterals of the ipsilateral connections. Our observations also point out the heterogeneity of corticothalamic boutons in the rat mediodorsal nucleus and morphological differences in the synaptic organization of prefrontal fibers innervating the two sides, indicating that ipsilateral cortical afferents may be more proximally distributed than crossed cortical fibers on dendrites of mediodorsal neurons.

The results indicate that corticothalamic connections of the STS in general reciprocate thalamocortical connections. The cortex of the upper bank of the STS-multimodal areas TPO and PGa-projects to four major thalamic targets: the pulvinar complex, the mediodorsal nucleus, the limitans-suprageniculate nucleus, as well as intralaminar nuclei. Within the pulvinar complex, the main projections of the upper bank of the STS are directed to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Rostral upper bank regions tend to project caudally and medially within the PM nucleus, caudal upper bank regions, more laterally and ventrally. The mid-portion of the upper bank tends to occupy the central sector of the PM nucleus. There are also relatively minor projections from upper bank regions to the lateral pulvinar (PL) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei. In contrast to the upper bank, the projections from the lower bank are directed primarily to the pulvinar complex, with only minor projections to intralaminar nuclei. The rostral portion of the lower bank projects mainly to caudal and medial regions of the PM nucleus, whereas the caudal lower bank projects predominantly to the lateral PM nucleus, and also to the PL, PO, and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei. The mid-portion of the lower bank projects mainly to central and lateral portions of the PM nucleus, and also to the PI and PL nuclei. The rostral depth of the STS projects mainly to the PM nucleus, with only minor connections to the PO, PI, and PL nuclei. The mid-portion of multimodal area TPO of the upper bank, areas TPO2 and TPO3, projects preferentially to the central sector of the PM nucleus.

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.",clustering coefficient; characteristic path length; transmission coefficient; modularity; small-world; brain networks; SMALL-WORLD; ORGANIZATION; BRAIN

This study aimed to investigate the functional connectivity of the thalamus in youth with ADHD, using both anatomically and functionally defined thalamic seed regions. Methods:Resting-state functional MRIs obtained from the publicly available ADHD-200 database were analyzed. Thalamic seed regions were defined functionally and anatomically based on Yeo's 7 resting-state-network parcellation atlas and the AAL3 atlas, respectively. Functional connectivity maps of the thalamus were extracted, and thalamocortical functional connectivity was compared between youth with and without ADHD. Results:Using the functionally defined seeds, significant group differences in thalamocortical functional connectivity and significant negative correlations between thalamocortical connectivity and ADHD symptom severity were observed within the boundaries of corresponding large-scale networks. However, in the analysis using the anatomically defined thalamic seeds, significant group differences in connectivity and significant positive correlations were observed outside the expected boundaries of major anatomic projections. The thalamocortical connectivity originating from the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus was significantly correlated with age in youth with ADHD. Limitations:The small sample size and smaller proportion of girls were limiting factors. Conclusion:Thalamocortical functional connectivity based on the intrinsic network architecture of the brain appears to be clinically relevant in ADHD. The positive association between thalamocortical functional connectivity and ADHD symptom severity may represent a compensatory process recruiting an alternative neural network.",nan; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; ORGANIZATION; THALAMUS; COMPENSATION; NETWORKS; NUCLEUS

According to Hassler, this area includes ventro-oralis posterior (Vop) and ventral intermedius (Vim) nuclei, although some investigators believe that Vop is associated with the pallidothalamic pathway. We sought to correlate our experimental data on distribution of nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents to the monkey thalamus with Hassler's motor thalamic parcelations. We concluded that Hassler's parcelations retained their value, although some adjustments were needed to relate them to the current neuroanatomic data; particularly, the cerebellothalamic zone that represents the monkey ventral lateral nucleus (VL) corresponds topographically to Hassler's Vop, Vim, and most of Voi. Electron microscopic tracing studies have shown very complex circuitry in this region of the monkey thalamus, as the cerebellar and cortical afferents innervating it are engaged in complex synapses with thalamocortical projection neurons, and this interaction is strongly modulated by local circuit neurons and the input from the reticular thalamic nucleus, which are both inhibitory and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic. Spinothalamic afferents also reach the VL. but this input is less studied in the monkey. The circuitry subserving the activity of thalamocortical projection neurons in the VL should be considered while interpreting the functional data obtained in stereotactic surgery.

Recent work in macaques suggests that the thalamus conveys corollary discharge information of upcoming saccades passing from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye field. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the thalamus in humans by assessing the effect of thalamic lesions on the processing of corollary discharge information. Thirteen patients with selective thalamic lesions and 13 healthy age-matched control subjects performed a saccadic double-step task in which retino-spatial dissonance was induced, i.e. the retinal vector of the second target and the movement vector of the second saccade were different. Thus, the subjects could not rely on retinal information alone, but had to use corollary discharge information to correctly perform the second saccade. The amplitudes of first and second saccades were significantly smaller in patients than in controls. Five thalamic lesion patients showed unilateral deficits in using corollary discharge information, as revealed by asymmetries compared with the other patients and controls. Three patients with lateral thalamic lesions including the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) were impaired contralaterally to the side of damage and one patient with a lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) was impaired ipsilaterally to the lesion. The largest asymmetry was found in a patient with a bilateral thalamic lesion. The results provide evidence for a thalamic involvement in the processing of corollary discharge information in humans, with a potential role of both the VL and MD nuclei.",saccades; thalamus; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; DOUBLE-STEP SACCADES; PARIETAL CORTEX; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; VISUAL SPACE; LESIONS; MOVEMENTS

TrkC-like immunoreactivity was widespread and consisted primarily of varicose fibers. The most dense populations of fibers were in the basal forebrain (in the cholinergic cell groups Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4), in the raphe complex throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and in the locus coeruleus. Other fibers were present in the thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray matter of the midbrain, dorsal midline of the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The only neuronal cell bodies with consistent labeling were located in the lateral hypothalamus. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum showed variable labeling. Specific labeling of varicosities and cell bodies was abolished by omission of the primary antiserum or by preabsorption with the TrkC peptide antigen. We conclude that TrkC-like immunoreactivity can be detected in a wide variety of subcortical locations in the adult rhesus monkey. Labeling was particularly prominent in the vicinity of the major cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic nuclei, known from other studies to be vulnerable in the ageing brain.

Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two alpha-, two beta- and one gamma- or delta-subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits alpha 1, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were found in all layers, alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, all three beta-subunits, gamma 2, and delta. Subunits alpha 3 and alpha 5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2, and delta were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2, whereas alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 1, and gamma 2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, and delta, and in the central amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit alpha 3-IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.","antibody alpha 1 (BD24); RRID:AB_2108828, ab alpha 2; RRID:AB_2827793, ab alpha 3; RRID:AB_2827797, ab alpha 4; RRID:AB_2827798, ab alpha 5; RRID:AB_2827799, ab beta 1; RRID:AB_2827800, ab beta 2; RRID:AB_2827801, ab beta 3; RRID:AB_2827802, ab gamma 2; RRID:AB_2827803, ab delta; RRID:AB_2827804, ab GAD67; RRID:AB_2278725, ab NeuN; RRID:AB_2278725; amygdala; basal ganglia; benzodiazepine; GABA(A) receptor subunits; goat biotinylated anti-rabbit ab; RRID:AB_2336810; horse anti-mouse ab; RRID:AB_2336811; immunohistochemistry; monkey; primate; thalamus; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; MESSENGER-RNAS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES; LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION"

Here, we demonstrate by combined retrograde tracing and immunocytochemistry that at least some of these are pulvinocortical relay neurons, and further report several distinctive features. First, in contrast with non-giant relay neurons, the giant neurons are often solitary and isolated from a main projection focus. The question thus arises of whether their cortical projections may be non-reciprocal or otherwise distinctive. Second, these neurons are positive for GluR4; but third, they are otherwise neurochemically heterogeneous, in that about one-third are positive for both parvalbumin (PV) and CB. Presumably, these subpopulations are also functionally heterogeneous. These results provide further evidence for the idea of multiple, interleaved organizations within the pulvinar; and they imply that thalamocortical projections are more disparate than has yet been appreciated. Finally, we found that giant CB+ neurons have a distinctive meshwork of large, PV+ terminations, prominent at the first dendritic branch point. In size and location, these resemble inhibitory terminations from the zona incerta or anterior pretectal nucleus (APT), as recently described in higher order thalamic nuclei in rats. One can speculate that giant neurons in the macaque pulvinar participate in a layer 5-APT-thalamus (giant neuron) extrareticular pathway, functionally distinct from the layer 6-reticular nucleus-thalamus network.",anterior pretectal nucleus; calbindin; extrareticular; GluR4; parvalbumin; pulvinocortical relay neurons; thalamocortical; INFERIOR PULVINAR; NEUROCHEMICAL SUBDIVISIONS; VISUAL AREAS; NUCLEUS; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; THALAMUS; MONKEYS; COMPLEX

Here we report on the distribution of response modalities to 487 intraoperative thalamic stimulations performed in 24 neurogenic pain (NP), 17 parkinsonian (PD) and 10 neuropsychiatric (Npsy) patients. Threshold responses were subdivided into somatosensory, motor and affective, and compared between medial (central lateral nucleus) and lateral (ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral medial) thalamic nuclei and between patients groups. Major findings were as follows: in the medial thalamus, evoked responses were for a large majority (95%) somatosensory in NP patients, 47% were motor in PD patients, and 54% affective in Npsy patients. In the lateral thalamus, a much higher proportion of somatosensory (83%) than motor responses (5%) was evoked in NP patients, while the proportion was reversed in PD patients (69% motor vs. 21% somatosensory). These results provide the first evidence for functional cross-modal changes in lateral and medial thalamic nuclei in response to intraoperative stimulations in different functional disorders. This extensive functional reorganization sheds new light on wide-range plasticity in the adult human thalamocortical system. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Each radiotracer is a propylsulfonamide-containing benzamide and was labeled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18. [C-11]CMPyPB was synthesized by the alkylation of a 3-hydroxypyridine precursor using [C-11]MeI, and [F-18]MK-6577 was synthesized by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction using a 2-chloropyridine precursor. Each tracer shows good uptake into rhesus monkey brain with the expected distribution of highest uptake in the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum and lower uptake in the striatum and gray matter of the frontal cortex. In vivo blockade and chase studies of [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal and reversible binding. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal in both rhesus monkey and human brain slices and a distribution consistent with the in vivo results and those reported in the literature. In vivo metabolism studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that only more-polar metabolites are formed for each tracer. Of these two tracers, [F-18]MK-6577 was more extensively characterized and is a promising clinical positron emission tomography tracer for imaging GlyT1 and for measuring GlyT1 occupancy of therapeutic compounds.

However, the mechanisms through which these therapeutic benefits are mediated remain poorly understood. Although the regulatory role of mGluR5 on glutamatergic transmission has been examined in various basal ganglia nuclei, very little is known about the localization and function of mGluR5 in the ventral motor and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the main targets of basal ganglia output in mammals. Thus, we used immuno-electron microscopy to map the cellular and subcellular localization of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) in the ventral motor and caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, using double immuno-electron microscopy, we examined the subsynaptic localization of mGluR5 in relation to cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Four major conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, mGluR1a and mGluR5 are expressed postsynaptically on the plasma membrane of dendrites of projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving regions of the ventral motor thalamus and in CM. Second, the plasma membrane-bound mGluR5 immunoreactivity is preferentially expressed perisynaptically at the edges of cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Third, the mGluR5 immunoreactivity is more strongly expressed in the lateral than the medial tiers of CM, suggesting a preferential association with thalamocortical over thalamostriatal neurons in the primate CM. Overall, mGluR5 is located to subserve powerful modulatory role of cortical and subcortical glutamatergic transmission in the primate ventral motor thalamus and CM.",Globus pallidus; Cerebellum; Rhesus monkey; mGluR; Parkinson's disease; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; DOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; BASAL-GANGLIA; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem, These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.",pulvinar; bursts; corticothalamic; drivers; modulators; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; VISUAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

Layers, loops and the emergence of fast synchronous rhythms","A large-scale computer model was constructed to gain insight into the structural basis for the generation of fast synchronous rhythms (20-60 Hz) in the thalamocortical system. The model consisted of 65 000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS

Lesions of the anterior thalamus in macaques produce impairments which resemble those seen after lesions of the fornix-mamillary pathway, which carries projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus, while lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, which receives inputs from frontal and temporal cortex, produce moderate impairments on a wider range of memory tasks. In the present study, we have made bilateral excitotoxic lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus, or both, in marmoset monkeys. Monkeys with lesions of both thalamic nuclei were severely impaired on retention and new learning of examples of the visuospatial conditional task, a task which is specifically impaired by lesions of the fornix or hippocampus. They were not impaired on performance of a visuovisual conditional task on which monkeys with hippocampal lesions are impaired, nor were they impaired on any visual discrimination task, including the concurrent discrimination task on which monkeys with temporal neocortical ablations are impaired. Monkeys with separate lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus were not impaired on any of these tasks. These results suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus and the anterior thalamus are both involved in processing the output of the hippocampal-fornix-thalamic circuit. Dense amnesia may result from damage to circuits additional to the temporal lobe efferents to either the anterior or the mediodorsal nuclei. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary of Review-Thalamic nuclei are composed of 5 major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions. Posterior choroidal lesions result in visual field deficits, variable sensory loss, weakness, dystonia, tremors, and occasionally amnesia and language impairment. Conclusions-These vascular syndromes reflect the reciprocal cerebral cortical-thalamic connections that have been interrupted and provide insights into the functional properties of the thalamus.",cerebral cortex; cognition; diaschisis; language; memory; thalamus; ARTERY TERRITORY INFARCTION; TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA; POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; MEDIAL PULVINAR NUCLEUS; PSYCHIC SELF-ACTIVATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

The main sources of thalamocortical inputs to the auditory cortex are the medial geniculate complex (MGC), medial pulvinar (PM), and several adjoining nuclei in the posterior thalamus. The distribution of inputs varies topographically by cortical area and thalamic nucleus, but in a manner that has not been fully characterized in primates. In this study, the thalamocortical connections of the lateral belt and parabelt were determined by placing retrograde tracer injections into various areas of these regions in the marmoset monkey. Both regions received projections from the medial (MGm) and posterodorsal (MGpd) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC); however, labeled cells in the anterodorsal (MGad) division were present only from injections into the caudal belt. Thalamic inputs to the lateral belt appeared to come mainly from the MGC, whereas the parabelt also received a strong projection from the PM, consistent with its position as a later stage of auditory cortical processing. The results of this study also indicate that the organization of the marmoset auditory cortex is similar to other primates. Anat Rec, 2012.

Thalamocortical inputs arise in parallel from four divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), which have regionally distinct projection patterns. These inputs terminate in layers IIIb and/or IV, and are assumed to be glutamatergic, although this has not been verified. In the present study, immunoreactivity (-ir) for the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2, was used to estimate the regional and laminar distribution of the glutamatergic thalamocortical projection in the macaque auditory cortex. Coronal sections containing auditory cortex were processed for VGluT2 and other markers concentrated in the thalamorecipient layers: cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and parvalbumin. Marker expression was studied with wide field and confocal microscopy. The main findings were: (1) VGkuT2-ir was highest in the core, intermediate in the belt, and sparse in the parabelt; (2) VGluT2-ir was concentrated in the neuropil of layers IIIb/IV in the core and layer IIIb in the belt; (3) VGluT2-ir matched regional and laminar expression of the other chemoarchitectonic markers. The results indicate that the glutamatergic thalamic projection to auditory cortex, as indexed by VGluT-2-ir, varies along the core-belt-parabelt axis in a manner that matches the gradients of other markers. These chemoarchitectonic features are likely to subserve regional differences in neuronal activity between regions of auditory cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the sensorimotor nuclei of the thalamus in humans using task-based fMRI at a field strength of 9.4T by assessing the individual subject-specific sensorimotor BOLD response during a combined active motor (finger-tapping) and passive sensory (tactile-finger) stimulation. We demonstrate that both tasks increase BOLD signal response in the lateral nuclei group (VPL, VA, VLa, and VLp), and in the pulvinar nuclei group (PuA, PuM, and PuL). Finger-tapping stimuli evokes a stronger BOLD response compared to the tactile stimuli, and additionally engages the intralaminar nuclei group (CM and Pf). In addition, our results demonstrate reproducible thalamic nuclei activation during motor and tactile stimuli.

One likely source is the central thalamus, which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Because the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye position signals arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, because the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye position signals in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye position signals in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye position signals were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye position signals to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that 2 distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye position signals from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye position signals through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks.",efference copy; monkey; neural integrator; single neurons; thalamocortical pathways; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; ABDUCENS NUCLEUS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY

Small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons were microiontophoretically injected with biotin-dextran or biocytin and their labeled axons were individually reconstructed from serial horizontal sections immunostained for calbindin-D28k to delineate striatal patch/matrix compartments. Reconstruction of >40 axons shows that all Cg3 corticofugal fibers, including corticothalamic axons from layer VI, course through the patch network in the rostromedial sector of the striatum. Corticostriatal projections arise from two types of layer V cells: (i) long-range corticofugal neurons, whose main axons reach the brainstem and/or spinal cord, and (ii) neurons arborizing into both striatum and claustrum, either ipsi-. contra- or bilaterally. The axons of these two types of neurons arborize profusely in striatal patches and only sparsely in the matrix. Layer VI neurons do not arborize in the striatum but target principally the thalamus. The same corticothalamic axon can innervate the anterior, rostral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These findings support the concept that no corticofugal fiber system exists that is solely devoted to the striatum. They also shed new light on how neural information from prelimbic cortex is conveyed to various subcortical limbic structures in the rat.",nan; SENSORY-MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MACAQUE MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LAMINAR ORIGIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION

Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. Methods: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. Results: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. Conclusion: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGrNs of humans.

The cartographic method relied on the use of intracerebral, ventricular landmarks (CA: anterior commissure and CP: posterior commissure). The basal ganglia outlines, first drawn in transverse sections perpendicular to the CA-CP plane, were reconstructed on the horizontal and midsagittal planes. Maps from several individuals were superimposed and statistical variations studied. The results confirm that the length between the two CA and CP points is statistically greater (7%) in the Macaca mulatta than Macaca fascicularis but reveal considerable inter-individual differences. The closer a given nucleus is from a ventricular reference point, the more stable its outline. Superimpositions led to a statistical determination of the stereotaxic coordinates required to reach a given target center. Comparison of the lateralities with those measured in six previously published atlases indicates that the brain mapped by Snider and Lee [17] is the smallest and that mapped by Olszewski [8] is the largest.",striatum; pallidum; subthalamic nucleus; monkeys; macaques; cerebral cartography; ventricular system; THALAMIC STEREOTAXY; MACACA; MONKEYS; SURGERY; LANDMARKS

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PHA-L

Young are born after 26-28 days of gestation and do not open their eyes until around 140 days after birth. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin was injected in the visual thalamus in adults and in pouch young aged from 22 days after birth, just after thalamic axons first reach the visual cortex, to 118 days, when cortical lamination resembles the adult. From 22 to 65 days, the developing visual cortex consists of a marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP), and intermediate zone (IZ) including the superficial subplate (SP), subventricular zone, and ventricular zone. There is a thin compact cell zone (CCZ) at the top of the CP and below it a less densely packed region that increases in thickness with age. Retrogradely labelled cells in two bands were first seen at 40 days, one in the CCZ and the other at the base of the CP. Two bands of cells were seen at all subsequent times if the injection covered both LGNd and LP, and by 76 days, these cells were located within cytoarchitectonically recognizable layers V and VI. Anterograde label prior to 45 days was distributed densely and evenly throughout the IZ and the CP up to the CCZ. Label in MZ was first seen at 25 days and was substantial by 54 days. Anterograde label then became gradually reduced in the IZ, whereas in the CP it remained evenly and densely distributed until 82 days. At this age, coincident with the emergence of layer IV, label within the CP first showed variations in density and by 99 days was concentrated over layer IV and, to a lesser extent, over layer VI. By 118 days label resembled the adult after injections covering both LGNd and LP, with label concentrated in layer I, IV, and VI with a less dense projection to lower layer III and upper layer V. There is a relatively earlier initial ingrowth of axons into the visual cortex in the wallaby and throughout development thalamocortical axons appear to be more widely distributed in the depth of the visual cortex than has been demonstrated for placental mammals. They are densely distributed up to the thin CCZ of the CP long before lamination of the cortex emerges beneath this zone. Soon after retrogradely labelled cells are first seen, the two bands of these cells that project to the LGNd and LP and ultimately reside in layers V and VI are also located in the region below the CCZ occupied by thalamocortical afferents. The question arises as to whether there is a waiting period in the SP in the wallaby. If there is not, this may be a genuine difference with placental mammals or a result of the more sensitive technique used here to demonstrate thalamocortical afferents.",GENICULOCORTICAL; LAMINATION; SEGREGATION; MAMMALIAN; ANATOMY; RHESUS-MONKEY; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; MACROPUS-EUGENII; TAMMAR WALLABY; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; OCULAR DOMINANCE; ACCESSIBLE MODEL; CONNECTIONS; CATS

By using both passively and actively transported axonal tracers in fetal and postnatal ferrets, we have analyzed the development of projections from the cortex to a number of thalamic nuclei. We report that the projections of a cortical area to its corresponding thalamic nuclei follow highly cell-specific programs of development, Axons from cells in the deepest layers of the cerebral cortex (layer 6 and superficial subplate neurons) appear to grow very slowly and be delayed for several weeks in the cerebral white matter, reaching the thalamus over a protracted period, Neurons of layer 5, on the other hand, develop their projections much faster; despite being born after the neurons of deeper layers, layer 5 neurons are the first to extend their axons out of the cortical hemisphere and innervate the thalamus, Layer 5 projections are massive in the first postnatal weeks but may become partly eliminated later in development, being overtaken in number by layer 6 cells that constitute the major corticothalamic projection by adulthood. Layer 5 projections are area-specific from the outset and arise as collateral branches of axons directed to the brainstem and spinal cord. Our findings show that the early development of corticofugal connections is determined not by the sequence of cortical neurogenesis but by developmental programs specific for each type of projection neuron, In addition, they demonstrate that in most thalamic nuclei, layer 5 neurons (and not subplate or layer 6 neurons) establish the first descending projections from the cerebral cortex.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTION; THALAMUS; FERRET; AXONAL GROWTH; VISUAL CORTICAL-NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FERRET; AXONS; SUBPLATE; PATHWAYS; ESTABLISHMENT; CONNECTIVITY; GENESIS

Regional net accumulation rate constants were derived from kinetic (two-tissue compartment model with irreversible tracer trapping) and graphic (Patlak) analyses, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input. The kinetic data analysis showed that the rate constant for the transfer of [C-11]HTP into the brain (K-1) was higher than that for [C-11]AMT in the striatum and thalamus but was similar in other brain regions. The rate constant for tracer trapping (k(3)) was also higher for [C-11]HTP than for [C-11]AMT in the striatum (0.046 +/- 0.024 versus 0.019 +/- 0.006 min(-1)) and thalamus (0.039 +/- 0.013 versus 0.016 +/- 0.007 min(-1)). In agreement with previously reported regional HTP accumulation rates, the net accumulation rate constant (K-acc) for [C-11]HTP was also higher in these regions than in other brain regions; this is in contrast to the uniform distribution of [C-11]AMT Kacc values. This suggests that the regional net accumulation rates obtained with these two PET tracers will be of different magnitude, which might be related to the activity of each targeted enzyme.",biosynthesis; 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan; alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan; positron emission tomography; rhesus monkey; serotonin; METHYL-L-TRYPTOPHAN; SUB-CORTICAL STRUCTURES; IN-VIVO; AMINO-ACIDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SYNTHESIS RATES; 5-HT SYNTHESIS; PET; METABOLISM; KINETICS

We also developed a highly efficient method for long-range tracing of sparse axonal fibers in datasets numbering hundreds of terabytes. This pipeline, which we call serial sectioning and clearing, three-dimensional microscopy with semi-automated reconstruction and tracing (SMART), enables effective connectome-scale mapping of large primate brains. With SMART, we were able to construct a cortical projection map of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and identify distinct turning and routing patterns of individual axons in the cortical folds while approaching their arborization destinations.",nan; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TISSUE; VISUALIZATION; PROJECTIONS; HISTOLOGY; CIRCUITS; THALAMUS; SPEED

However, recent studies in the monkey have documented projections from MD to the more caudal, agranular regions of the frontal cortex, suggesting that the connections of MD may be characterized by a breadth of distribution and diversity of functional roles too great to be useful as a unifying and defining feature for a specific cortical territory. In this study, we placed tracer injections in the lateral divisions of MD in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the relative proportions of connections devoted to diverse regions of the frontal cortex (FC). Three different patterns of label were observed in the cortex, associated with different locations within lateral MD. We have designated these as the ventrolateral MD-arcuate FC circuit, having most label in areas 8 and 6; the caudoventral MD-dorsomedial FC circuit, having most label in areas 24 and presupplementary motor area (SMA); and the anterodorsal MD-anterior FC circuit, with the most label in areas 9, 46, 12, and 10. Only two of the nine cases injected in lateral MD were predominantly connected with the anterior FC. Thus, particular locales within lateral MD are connected with multiple, functionally diverse cortical regions, including several not classically recognized as prefrontal areas. This divergence may distinguish MD-frontocortical and reciprocal corticothalamic pathways from the largely segregated pathways arising from the other thalamic nuclei that are interconnected with the frontal cortex, such as those from the ventrolateral nuclear group.

Here, we describe a set of computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques. Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications. Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through more accurate computational models of DBS.",thalamus; high-field imaging; susceptibility weighted imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; fiber; tractography; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION; AFFINE REGISTRATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEFORMABLE ATLAS; MR-IMAGES; IRON

How the brain decides the timing of self-initiated movements remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways play this role, but the subcortical signals that determine movement timing have not been identified. The present study reports that a subset of thalamic neurons predicts the timing of self-initiated saccadic eye movements. When monkeys made a saccade in response to the fixation point ( FP) offset in the traditional memory saccade task, neurons in the ventrolateral and the ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus exhibited a gradual buildup of activity that peaked around the most probable time of the FP offset; however, neither the timing nor the magnitude of neuronal activity correlated with saccade latencies, suggesting that the brain is unlikely to have used this information to decide the times of saccades in the traditional memory saccade task. In contrast, when monkeys were required to make a self-timed saccade within a fixed time interval after an external cue, the same neurons again exhibited a strong buildup of activity that preceded saccades by several hundred milliseconds, showing a close correlation between the times of neuronal activity and the times of self-initiated saccades. The results suggest that neurons in the motor thalamus carry subjective time information, which is used by cortical networks to determine the timing of self-initiated saccades.",saccade; self-timing; thalamus; motor system; physiology; primate; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; GENERATED LIMB MOVEMENTS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTERNAL GENERATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

Magnetic resonance and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study, wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain, especially the temporal lobe and thalamus, were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp, ictal and cortical electroencephalography, MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients, Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition, hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however, corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor.

To aid in functional and structural data analysis, we have created a comprehensive parcellation of the rhesus macaque subcortex using a high-resolution ex vivo structural imaging scan. This anatomical scan and its parcellation were warped to the updated NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2), an in vivo population template, where the parcellation was refined to produce the Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (SARM) with 210 primary regions-of-interest (ROIs). The subcortical parcellation and nomenclature reflect those of the 4th edition of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos et al., in preparation ), rather than proposing yet another novel atlas. The primary ROIs are organized across six spatial hierarchical scales from small, fine-grained ROIs to broader composites of multiple ROIs, making the SARM suitable for analysis at different resolutions and allowing broader labeling of functional signals when more accurate localization is not possible. As an example application of this atlas, we have included a functional localizer for the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus in three macaques using a visual flickering checkerboard stimulus, identifying and quantifying significant fMRI activation in this atlas region. The SARM has been made openly available to the neuroimaging community and can easily be used with common MRI data processing software, such as AFNI, where the atlas has been embedded into the software alongside cortical macaque atlases.",Segmentation; Anatomy; Subcortex; Cerebellum; Thalamus; Brainstem; BRAIN ATLAS; MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; MRI; AMYGDALA; NORMALIZATION; STIMULATION; PROJECTIONS; TEMPLATE; MIDBRAIN

However, it is not clear whether the neural connections of the posteroventral part differ from those of the rest of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Here, we describe the thalamic connections of the posteroventral part of monkey area 23b (pv-area 23b), the main component of the posteroventral posterior cingulate gyrus. We compare these thalamic connections with those of the more dorsal area 23b (d-area 23b) and of adjoining retrosplenial areas 29 and 30. Thalamocortical projections to pv-area 23b originate mainly from the anterior nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. In contrast, projections to d-area 23b originate from the nucleus lateralis posterior, medial pulvinar, nucleus centralis latocellularis, mediodorsal nucleus and nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis and weakly from the anterior nuclei. Projections to retrosplenial areas 29 and 30 originate from the anterior nuclei. Corticothalamic projections from pv-area 23b terminate in the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. Projections from d-area 23b terminate in these nuclei as well as the nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis. Projections from area 30 terminate mainly in the anterior nuclei and, to a lesser extent, in the medial pulvinar. These results show that the connections of pv-area 23b differ from those of d-area 23b or areas 29 and 30. This suggests that pv-area 23b may play distinct functional roles in memory processes, such as spatial and auditory memory.",anterior thalamic nuclei; area 23b; medial pulvinar; nucleus lateralis posterior; retrosplenial cortex; RHESUS-MONKEY; RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; TETRAMETHYL BENZIDINE; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AFFERENTS; MEMORY; ANTERIOR; AMNESIA; SENSITIVITY; PROJECTIONS

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

In order to determine the origin and extent of corticocortical and thalamocortical projections to layer I of the frontal/premotor area M2 of the rat neocortex, we have used fluorescent anatomical tracing methods to determine the precise sources of cortical and thalamic input to the rostral and caudal aspects of layer I of M2. Retrograde tracer diamidino yellow (DY), applied directly to the pial surface on rostral or caudal areas of rat M2 (RM2 and CM2, respectively) labeled cells ipsilaterally throughout layers II/III, V, and VII of the adjacent primary motor area and the parietal areas (SI and SH). In addition, retrograde transport labeled contralateral CM2 or RM2 in layers II/III and V at sites homotopic to either CM2 or RM2 application sites. Contralateral layer VII was retrogradely labeled by the application to layer I of CM2, but not by the RM2 application. Retrograde DY transport from layer I of RM2 or CM2 of was seen in the ventral medial (VM), ventral lateral (VL), and posterior (Po) thalamic nuclei. However layer I transport from CM2 additionally labeled the thalamic central medial (CM) nucleus, while the RM2 labeled the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. Upon determination that thalamic nuclei VM and VL were of primary interest in this study, due to their dense retrograde labeling, injections of anterograde tracer rhodamine dextranamine (RDA) into VM or VL were performed in order to study the projection patterns of these nuclei to layer I of the frontal cortex. RDA injections into VM labeled fibers extending through layer I of both RM2 and CM2 and throughout the cingulate cortex. Injections of RDA into VL consistently labeled dense fibers in layer I of both CM2 and RM2, although labeling was sharply decreased anterior to CM2. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that projections to layer I from all sources of cortical input make a significant contribution to integration throughout the neocortex.

However, little is known about protein expression patterns in other areas of the brain. In situ hybridization studies have shown high ErbB4 mRNA levels in various subcortical areas, suggesting that ErbB4 is also expressed in cell types other than cortical interneurons. Here, using highly-specific monoclonal antibodies, we provide the first extensive report of ErbB4 protein expression throughout the cerebrum of primates. We show that ErbB4 immunoreactivity is high in association cortices, intermediate in sensory cortices, and relatively low in motor cortices. The overall immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation is intermediate, but is high in a subset of interneurons. We detected the highest overall immunoreactivity in distinct locations of the ventral hypothalamus, medial habenula, intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and structures of the ventral forebrain, such as the islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum, and medium expression in the reticular thalamic nucleus. While this pattern is generally consistent with ErbB4 mRNA expression data, further investigations are needed to identify the exact cellular and subcellular sources of mRNA and protein expression in these areas. In contrast to in situ hybridization in rodents, we detected only low levels of ErbB4-immunoreactivity in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei but a diffuse pattern of immunofluorescence that was medium in the dorsal striatum and high in the ventral forebrain, suggesting that most ErbB4 protein in dopaminergic neurons could be transported to axons. We conclude that the NRG-ErbB4 signaling pathway can potentially influence many functional systems throughout the brain of primates, and suggest that major sites of action are areas of the corticolimbic network. This interpretation is functionally consistent with the genetic association of NRG1 and ERBB4 with schizophrenia.",nan; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PARVALBUMIN-POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TYROSINE KINASE; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS

However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AROUSAL REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-STIMULI; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE; AFFERENTS

Nonhuman primate studies have highlighted the crucial role of the cerebellum for saccade adaptation, but its neural substrates in humans are poorly understood. Recent physiological experiments suggest that, in addition to cerebellar structures, cortical areas may be involved as well. We have therefore hypothesized that saccade adaptation may rely on a cerebello-cerebral network, in which the cerebellar thalamus may link cerebellar and cerebral structures. To test this hypothesis, we studied saccade adaptation in a group of four patients with a thalamic lesion, with (n=2) or without (n=2) involvement of the cerebellar thalamus. Compared to healthy subjects, saccade adaptation was reduced in patients with associated cerebellar syndrome, but normal in patients without cerebellar syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cerebello-thalamic pathways contribute to saccade adaptation in humans and suggest that the thalamus relays adaptation-related information from the cerebellum to cerebral cortical oculomotor areas.",adaptation; human; oculomotor system; saccade; thalamus; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ATAXIC HEMIPARESIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; OCULOMOTOR REGION; GAIN ADAPTATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; DENTATE NUCLEUS

Methods: Nissl-stained sections were examined to determine the boundaries of, and the distribution of neuronal sizes within, the medial pulvinar, In addition, Golgi-impregnated neurons were examined and drawn for analysis, Only rhesus monkey specimens were used, and the material had been prepared previously for other studies. Results: Projection neurons have round to oval somata and moderate numbers of primary dendrites that extend for short distances before branching into many secondary branches, Two variations of projection neurons (P1 and P2) were distinguished on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic tree, Both varieties have short dendrites that radiate in all directions, They differ in that P2 cells have longer second tier dendrites than P1 cells, Three types of local circuit neurons, tufted, radiating and varicose, were distinguished on the basis of their dendritic morphology, Four types of afferent fibers were identified. Type 1 afferents form cone-shape terminal arbors. Type 2 afferents are similar to those reported for retinal or cortical terminals, Type 3 afferents are of medium thickness and of an unknown origin, Type 4 afferents are thin and have small varicosities consistent with previously described cortical afferents, Afferent fibers are predominantly oriented along the mediolateral axis of the nucleus. We observed putative contacts between some afferents and local circuit neurons and between local circuit neurons and projection neurons, Conclusions: Medial pulvinar neurons are generally smaller and rounder than those found in the adjacent pulvinar nuclei, These results provide additional evidence for structural distinctions between thalamic nuclei having different functions, However, the observed differences are subtle, In addition, the data in this report provide morphological evidence that cortical signals are likely to be integrated by means of the circuitry located within the nucleus.

This study investigated the morphology of single axons of entopeduncular neurons projecting to the motor thalamus by placing small injections of dextran biotin into the EP and reconstructing drawings of single axone from serial sections. There were two populations of entopeduncular-thalamic projection axone: those that projected only to the motor thalamus (VL and VM) and those that projected to both the motor thalamus and other nuclei (e.g., the habenula). The neurochemistry of EP neurons projecting to the thalamus was investigated by injecting the retrograde tracer FluoroCold into the VL and VM thalamic nuclei to retrogradely fill entopeduncular projection neurons. These were subsequently immunohistochemically labeled for choline acetyl transferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Consistent with previous studies, significant proportions of these neurons were GABA immunoreactive. In addition, approximately half of the entopeduncular-thalamic projecting neurons were found to be cholinergic. This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula.

Data we obtained in one patient after a limited left thalamic infarct bring some new insights into this debate. This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch. vibration. joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities. He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior media (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely. the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological Studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission. while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.

Fractional anisotropy reflects the integrity of white matter fibers. Fractional anisotropy of a young adult brain is low in gray matter, high in white matter, and highest in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Thus, we selected the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, head of the caudate nucleus, semioval center, thalamus, and corpus callosum (splenium and genu) as regions of interest when using diffusion-tensor imaging to observe fractional anisotropy of major white matter fiber tracts and the deep gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys aged 4-8 years. Results showed no laterality differences in fractional anisotropy values. Fractional anisotropy values were low in the head of caudate nucleus and thalamus in gray matter. Fractional anisotropy values were highest in the splenium of corpus callosum in the white matter, followed by genu of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy values were lowest in the semioval center and posterior limb of internal capsule.

Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 mu m(2)) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 mu m(2)), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 mu m(2)) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 mu m(2) and 1.6 mu m(2), respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 mu m of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest.

Axons were labeled from the thalamus by a fluorescent carbocyanine dye in fixed tissue or by transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin from the eye. Thalamic axons first reached the cortex 2 weeks after birth and grew into the developing cortical plate without a waiting period in the subplate. The first thalamocortical synapses were detected 2 weeks later solely throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate, where layer 6 cells previously have been shown to reside. As the thickness of the cortex increased with age, thalamocortical synapses were increasingly prevalent in the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. With the appearance of layer 4, thalamocortical synapses were found there as well as in the marginal zone and layer 6. There was no evidence for an early population of thalamocortical synapses in the subplate.

Each injection resulted in anterograde labeling in the three subdivisions of the ventral anterior nucleus (pars parvicellularis, VApc; pars densicellularis, VAdc; and pars magnocellularis, VAmc) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VL). NRT fibers had beaded shapes and coursed in a posterior direction giving rise to relatively diffuse terminal plexuses. The average size of the beads (0.7 mu m(2)) and their density per 100 mu m of fiber length (23.7-25.7) were similar between the nuclei studied. At the electron microscopic level, anterogradely labeled boutons displayed positive immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and formed relatively long (similar to 0.4 mu m) symmetric synaptic contacts. Usually, a single terminal formed synapses on more than one postsynaptic structure. Synaptic contacts were on projection and local circuit neurons and targeted mainly their distal dendrites. In the VAmc, synapses on local circuit neurons composed 48% of the total sample, in the VAdc/VApc and in the VL the proportion was higher, 65% and 62%, respectively. The results suggest that the input from the anterior pole of the monkey reticular nucleus to the motor-related thalamic nuclei is organized differently from what is known on the organization of connections of NRT with sensory thalamic nuclei in other species in that the terminal fields of individual fibers are diffuse rather than focal and that at least 50% of synapses are established on GABAergic local circuit neurons.

The animals had to choose correctly between pairs of stimuli drawn from a population of 16. Four of these stimuli were associated with 0 reward pellets, four with 1 pellet, four with 2 pellets and four with 4 pellets. Mediodorsal thalamic lesions including the medial part of the mediodorsal nucleus, similar to those which are frequently seen in Korsakoff amnesia, produced a severe impairment in this task. The impairment was seen both in memory for the quantity of reward, as expressed in choices between 1-pellet and 2-pellet stimuli or choices between 2-pellet and 4-pellet stimuli, and also in memory for the qualitative absence or presence of reward, as expressed in choices between 0-pellet and 1-pellet stimuli. The deficit in this task establishes that mediodorsal thalamic lesions in monkeys can impair long-term memory tasks, in addition to their known effects on several short-term memory tasks. The contrast between the present results and those of previous experiments on visual long-term memory in the monkey following mediodorsal thalamic lesions can be related to similar contrasts in studies of lesions in the amygdala, suggesting that the functions of these two structures are related.",CYNOMOLGUS; AMNESIA; VISUAL LEARNING; MONKEYS; NUCLEUS; CORTEX

Multiple injections of combinations of two dyes (diamidino yellow dihydrochloride, Evans blue, fast blue, granular blue) were made into either the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri or into the medial and lateral regions of the anterior sigmoid gyrus in the anesthetized dog. We found that the thalamic afferents of areas 4 and 6 arise from topographically organized bands of cells that traverse several thalamic nuclei and extend throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the thalamus. The most medial band included area 6-projecting neurons in the anterior nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus, the ventral anterior nucleus (VA), ventromedial nucleus (VM) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Within this band, cells projecting to medial area 6a alpha tended to be more numerous in the anterior nuclei, anterior parts of VA and VM and anterior and caudal parts of MD. Fewer cells in MD but more cells in caudal parts of VA and VM projected to lateral area 6a beta. Lateral bands of cells in central through lateral parts of VA and VL projected topographically to lateral area 4 on the anterior sigmoid gyrus and lateral through medial parts of postcruciate area 4. The most lateral band of cells in VL continued ventrally into the zona incerta. Area 4 also received input from VM and the central lateral (CL) and centrum medianum (CM) nuclei. Within regions of VA, VL and VM, cells from one band interspersed with cells from another, but there were very few double-labeled cells projecting to two cortical sites.

Actively detecting a vibrotactile stimulus and reporting its perception elicited a sustained poststimulus beta power increase in VPL and an alpha power decrease in S1, in both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent trials. These oscillatory dynamics in the somatosensory thalamocortical network depended on the behavioral context: they were stronger for the active detection condition than for a passive stimulation condition. Furthermore, contrasting stimulus-present vs. stimulus-absent responses, we found that poststimulus theta power increased in both VPL and S1, and alpha/beta power decreased in S1, reflecting the monkey's perceptual decision but not the motor response per se. Additionally, higher prestimulus alpha power in S1 correlated with an increased probability of the monkey reporting a stimulus, regardless of the actual presence of a stimulus. Thus, we found task-related modulations in oscillatory activity, not only in the neocortex but also in the thalamus, depending on behavioral context. Furthermore, oscillatory modulations reflected the perceptual decision process and subsequent behavioral response. We conclude that these early sensory regions, in addition to their primary sensory functions, may be actively involved in perceptual decision making.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL THALAMUS

Lesions of the basal ganglia typically result in poverty of movement (e.g., akinesia) or excessive movement (e.g., hyperkinesia), and lesions of the cerebellum result in incoordination of movement (e.g., ataxia). However, recent research has revealed that in addition to the primary motor cortex, the basal ganglia and cerebellum also demonstrate projection zones to the premotor cortex, frontal eye field , and prefrontal, inferotemporal, and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting a supplementary role for these structures (i.e., basal ganglia and cerebellum) in the regulation of cognitive processes. Subcortical cognitive deficits paralleling motor impairments such as difficulty in shifting attentional set and difficulty in coordinating mental activity have been described in the neuropsychological literature. However, correlates relative to hypolinguistic or dysmetric language processes are yet to be adequately defined. Aims: The aim of the current research, therefore, was to compare and contrast the language profiles of individuals with thalamic versus cerebellar lesions. Methods & Procedures: Two cases with surgically induced lesions of the left ventral intermediate thalamus, and two cases with spontaneous vascular infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere, served as experimental subjects in this research. General and high-level language profiles were compiled for each subject and performance compared to a roup of 16 non-neurologically impaired controls (NC). The criterion for anomalous performance was established as >= 2 SD below the NC group mean. Outcomes & Results : Evident deficits were largely restricted to complex language functions, irrespective of lesion type. Of note, however, was that thalamic lesions were associated with a higher overall proportion of significantly reduced test scores, as well as greater magnitudes of decline from normal when compared to cerebellar lesions. Conclusions: These results lend support to working theories of subcortical participation in language that promote a superordinate role for the thalamus in the regulation of higher-level lexical-semantic processes. Further more , the present findings also highlight the need to consider a novel role for the left cerebellar hemisphere in coordinating cognitive-linguistic systems.",nan; RHESUS-MONKEY; LANGUAGE; LESIONS; ORGANIZATION; DIASCHISIS; DEFICITS; THOUGHT

Neurons convergent for baroreceptor and nociceptive input have also been identified in the homologous anterior insula of the primate. Whether similar convergent cells exist in the ventrobasal thalamus was investigated in 30 urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Six classes of cells were identified in the right ventrobasal thalamus: (a) 83/159 (52%) baroreceptive and nociceptive convergent units; (b) 2/159 (1%) convergent cells responding to baroreceptor activation and light touch; (c) 44/159 (28%) purely nociceptive units; (d)10/159 (6%) purely baroreceptive units; (e) 1/159 (0.6%) cells responding to brush alone and (f) 19/159 (12%) unresponsive units. Of the viscerosomatic convergent cells, 66/85 (78%) were situated in the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPL), 6/85 (7%) in the ventroposterolateral parvicellular nucleus (VPLpc), and 13/85 (15%) in the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM). Fifteen right ventrobasal thalamic units were antidromically activated and 34 units orthodromically activated by right posterior insular microstimulation. Cobalt injection into the right ventrobasal thalamus blocked the right insular response to baroreceptor activation by > 70%. These data indicate: (a) baroreceptive and somatosensory nociceptive convergent units exist in the ventrobasal thalamus; (b) thalamic convergent neurons project directly to the ipsilateral posterior insula and receive reciprocal insulothalamic projections; and (c) a significant proportion of baroreceptor input relays to the posterior insula through the ipsilateral ventrobasal thalamus.

The thalamus receives extensive feedback from the cortex and this influences the firing pattern, synchronization and sensory response mode of relay cells. A crucial question concerns the extent to which the feedback simply controls the state and transmission mode of relay cells and the extent to which the feedback participates in the specific processing of sensory information. Using examples from experiments examining the influence of feedback from the visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we argue that thalamic mechanisms are selectively focused by visually driven feedback to optimize the thalamic contribution to segmentation and global integration. This involves effects on both the temporal and spatial parameters characterizing the responses of LGN cells and includes, for example, motion-driven feedback effects from MT (middle temporal visual area) relayed via layer 6 of V1 (primary visual cortex).",lateral geniculate nucleus; corticofugal feedback; primary visual cortex; middle temporal visual area; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; LAYER-VI; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; DYNAMIC PROPERTIES; SPATIAL SUMMATION; AREAS V1; CAT

In the earliest period analyzed, from 5-6 weeks of gestation, dorsal and ventral parts of the human thalamus were poorly differentiated structures forming the sides of the third ventricle. At 6 g.w., the prospective thalamic anlage consisted of the ventricular (VZ), the intermediate (IZ) and the marginal zones (MZ). The neurons in the VZ were bipolar and radially arranged to the ventricular surface. From 6-8 gestational weeks detached bipolar or branched bipolar cells with horizontal or oblique orientation were encountered in the IZ and occasionally in the MZ. In the period between 10-14 weeks of gestation, segregation of neurons into different thalamic nuclei began. The lateral geniculate nucleus, centrum medianum and mediodorsal nucleus were the first to be distinguished. In comparison with the previous period, the neurons throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the thalamus were more differentiated, with a higher number of primary dendrites that were often bifurcated. This resulted in various shapes of immature neurons: simple uni- and bipolar (type 1), branched uni- and bipolar (type 2) and young multipolar (type 3). In addition, the first spines were frequently observed on dendrites at 12 weeks of gestation. At 14-16 weeks of gestation, segregation of the neurons into thalamic nuclei continued. The neurons exhibited further dendritic differentiation that followed the caudo rostral gradient. For the first time, multipolar neurons, especially in the caudal part, could be sub-divided into two classes: multipolar with a 'bushy' appearance, the result of many primary dendrites with several bifurcations and 'simpler' multipolar neurons with fewer and less branched primary dendrites. Neuronal differentiation was further expressed by an increase in the total dendritic length and somatic surface, up to six and three times, respectively, from the earliest period analyzed to 16 weeks of gestation. Dendritic length increased initially by the formation of new primary branches and their elongation and secondly by formation of higher branch orders. At 16 g.w., a group of immature cells were observed dorsally, on the frontal sections through the rostral thalamus.

While both subcortical structures process information in basically segregated loops that primarily interact in the neocortex, direct subcortical interaction has been recently confirmed by neuroanatomical studies using viral transneuronal tracers in non-human primate brains. The thalamus is thought to be the main relay station of both projection systems. Yet, our understanding of subcortical basal ganglia and cerebellar interconnectivity within the human thalamus is rather sparse, primarily due to limitation in the acquisition of in vivo tracing. Consequently, we strive to characterize projections of both systems and their potential overlap within the human thalamus by diffusion MRI and tractography. Our analysis revealed a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient for pallido-thalamic connections in: (1) the ventral-anterior thalamus, (2) the intralaminar nuclei, and (3) midline regions. Conversely, we found a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient for dentato-thalamic projections predominantly in: (1) the ventral-lateral and posterior nucleus; (2) dorsal parts of the intralaminar nuclei and the subparafascicular nucleus, and (3) the medioventral and lateral mediodorsal nucleus. A considerable overlap of connectivity pattern was apparent in intralaminar nuclei and midline regions. Notably, pallidal and cerebellar projections were both hemispherically lateralized to the left thalamus. While strikingly consistent with findings from transneuronal studies in non-human primates as well as with pre-existing anatomical studies on developmentally expressed markers or pathological human brains, our assessment provides distinctive connectional fingerprints that illustrate the anatomical substrate of integrated functional networks between basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Thereby, our findings furnish useful implications for cerebellar contributions to the clinical symptomatology of movement disorders.",Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; Connectivity; Diffusion MRI; Hemispheric lateralization; CENTROMEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACACA-MULATTA; MOTOR CORTEX; NUCLEUS; CONNECTIONS

The inferior pulvinar (PI) complex consisted of multiple subdivisions and encompassed the classic PI, and adjacent ventral parts of the lateral and medial pulvinar (PL and Phl, respectively). In keeping with nomenclature suggested previously for macaques, the PI subdivisions were termed the posterior, medial, central, lateral, and lateral-shell (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S). In both species, PIP was intense for calbindin, light for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and very light for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) histochemistry. The PIM was calbindin poor, AChE rich, and moderate for WFA. The PIC was calbindin intense, lighter for AChE, and exhibited little WFA binding. PIL and PIL-S contained populations of large calbindin or WFA cells that were more numerous in PIL-S. Although staining with the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 differed between macaques and squirrel monkeys, the same subdivisions were displayed, Moderately dense, patchy Cat-301 stain was found in PIM of macaques, whereas in squirrel monkeys PIM was Light. Connections of the rostral dorsolateral (DLr) and middle temporal (MT) areas of visual cortex in squirrel monkeys were compared with PI subdivisions revealed by the neu er histochemical methods in the same cases. The major connections of DLr were with PIC and of MT were with PIM.

We studied the responsiveness of neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) to electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), and the ventral subnucleus of the thalamus (VPLo) with chronically implanted electrodes. 2. All neurons examined in this study were characterized by their relation to a motor task performed by the animals. They responded to stimulation of the cortical or thalamic area with excitation from one area alone (n = 128) or from multiple areas (n = 84) of all combinations. In a majority of neurons, response latencies to both cortical and thalamic stimulation were within 5 ms. 3. A vast majority of neurons (80%) that were active during a preparatory period for forthcoming reaching movements were activated by SMA stimulation. They were activated only infrequently by SI or thalamic stimulation. 4. Movement-related neurons(active immediately before and during reaching movements) were activated by thalamic, SI, or SMA stimulation or by any combination of those stimuli. More than half of the movement-related neurons activated exclusively by either thalamic or SMA stimulation exhibited activity onset times earlier than those observed in the earliest muscles. By contrast, most movement-related neurons that responded only to SI stimulation were late in their activity onset. 5. These findings suggest that the SMA input to MI is important in developing a preparatory type of activity in MI, whereas the thalamus (VPLo) provides substantial inputs in movement execution. The roles played by inputs from SI and SMA in relation to motor execution an debatable and are discussed here with reference to previous reports.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PROXIMAL FORELIMB MOVEMENTS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACACA-MULATTA; THALAMIC INPUT

Thalamic infarcts in paramedian artery territory are seen fairly frequently owing to certain peculiarities of the vascularization of the thalamus. However, clinical diagnosis is usually difficult because of the many varieties and peculiarities of the symptomatology. Material and Methods. We present a review of twelve cases of bilateral paramedian infarcts of the thalamus seen in our Department of Neurology and in a private surgery. We analyze the symptoms and their relationship to the neuro-radiological findings. Finally we compare our observations with the descriptions published by other authors and seek an anatomo-functional relationship for each of the symptoms and signs observed. Results. The usual clinical outline in our patients included disorders of consciousness, different types of oculomotor disorders and cerebellar symptoms, mainly of gait. Other less common findings were memory disorders and abnormal movements. In no case were there sensory changes and pyramidal signs were rare in the absence of significant extra-thalamic lesions. Conclusions. Our findings, although generally comparable to those described in the literature consulted, were somewhat different with regard to cerebellar symptoms arm the absence of sensory and pyramidal signs. We also emphasize the marked differences seen between the individual patients in our series. A good knowledge of the possible clinical variants of these lesions is necessary for a correct initial diagnostic approach in the study of these patients [REVNEUROL 1997, 25. 1353-62].",amnesia; ataxia; disorder of consciousness; eye movement; ictus; infarct; paramedian artery; thalamus; FRONTAL-LOBE; COMMUNICATING ARTERY; DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEY; MIDBRAIN; MEMORY; DISORDERS; LESIONS; NUCLEUS

Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the ventral parts of dentate nuclei. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the VL were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the thalamus. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the VL either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different VL locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the thalamus. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the VL that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.

Brain tissue from macaques was immunoreacted by means of antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to histamine and processed for light and electron microscopy. A dense plexus of thin, highly branched ChAT-immunoreactive axons laden with varicosities was found in all layers of the dLGN including the koniocellular laminae and in the pregeniculate nucleus. ChAT label was more dense in magnocellular layers 1 and 2 than in parvocellular layers 3-6 and relatively sparse in the interlaminar zones. Varicosities associated with the cholinergic axons had an average of three conventional asymmetric synapses per varicosity, and these appeared to contact dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons. Histamine-immunoreactive axons were distributed homogeneously throughout all laminar and interlaminar zones of the dLGN, but mere denser in the pregeniculate nucleus than in the dLGN. Histaminergic axons branched infrequently and were typically larger in caliber than cholinergic axons. The overwhelming majority of varicosities were found en passant and rarely displayed conventional synapses, despite the abundance of synaptic vesicles, and were not associated preferentially with specific cellular structures. The innervation of the macaque dLGN complex by cholinergic and histaminergic systems is consistent with their proposed role in state dependent modulation of thalamic activity. The dense and highly synaptic innervation by cholinergic axons supports the proposal of additional involvement of these axons in functions related to eye movements. Anat Rec 255:295-305, 1999.

Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.",Anterior intraparietal area; area 5; area 7; lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; pulvinar; VENTRAL PREMOTOR AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VISUAL GUIDANCE; NEW-WORLD; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX

Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.

We emphasize that the cerebellar thalamus deserves a renewal of interest to better understand its specific contributions to the cerebellar motor and associative functions, especially at a time where the anatomy between cerebellum and basal ganglia is being rewritten.",Cerebellum; Thalamus; Movement; Spike; Burst; Rebound; Cognition; Tremor; Inverse model; Dynamical system; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBELLOTHALAMIC PATHWAY; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DENTATE NUCLEUS; MACACA-FUSCATA; MOTOR THALAMUS

Although CYPIBI protein is known to metabolize estradiol to catecholestrogens in the uterus. its localization and function in brain have not yet been described. To better understand CYPIBI distribution, we have combined in situ hybridization (ISH) for its mRNA with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CYPIBI protein in selected brain regions of male and female adult rhesus monkey mulatta). Blocks of formalin-fixed tissue obtained from the frontal cortex, hippocampus. thalamus, and amygdala were processed and embedded in paraffin.

In contrast, although CYPIBI protein was co-localized with its mRNA in the female brains, it was primarily restricted to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the male brains.

Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; AUDITORY-STIMULI; SPATIAL NEGLECT; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTION; MACAQUE; MECHANISMS; AFFERENTS

In order to compare these with histologically demonstrated connections of the PPN in monkeys, and thus to Support the use of PDT in humans, we have carried out PDT in a fixed rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) brain. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was carried out in a fixed post-mortem rhesus monkey brain using diffusion data acquired at 3T MRI (60 directions x 5 averages, b = 3000 s/mm(2), matrix size = 104 x 132 x 96, 720 x 720 x 720 mu m voxels). We identified the major connections of the PPN from single seed voxels that could be confidently located within the nucleus on the diffusion images. The organisation of these connections within a 3 x 3 x 3 voxel (similar to 10 mm(3)) region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. PDT confirmed that the rhesus monkey PPN connections with the basal ganglia and motor cortical areas matched those previously demonstrated using conventional anatomical tracing techniques. Furthermore, although the Organisation Of subcortical connections within the PPN has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, we show here in a rhesus monkey that there are clearly separated connections of the PPN with the thalamus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Thus, in addition to increasing confidence in the accuracy of PDT for tracing PPN connections and determining the Organisation of these connections within the PPN in vivo, our observations suggest that diffusion tractography will be a useful new technique to rapidly identify connections in animal brains pre-mortem and post-mortem.

However, mapping the neuronal projections with individual-axon resolution in the large and complex primate brain is still challenging. Herein, we describe a highly efficient pipeline for three-dimensional mapping of the entire macaque brain with subcellular resolution. The pipeline includes a novel poly-N-acryloyl glycinamide (PNAGA)based embedding method for long-term structure and fluorescence preservation, high-resolution and rapid whole-brain optical imaging, and image post-processing. The cytoarchitectonic information of the entire macaque brain was acquired with a voxel size of 0.32 gm x 0.32 gm x 10 gm, showing its anatomical structure with cell distribution, density, and shape. Furthermore, thanks to viral labeling, individual long-distance projection axons from the frontal cortex were for the first time reconstructed across the entire brain hemisphere with a voxel size of 0.65 gm x 0.65 gm x 3 gm. Our results show that individual cortical axons originating from the prefrontal cortex simultaneously target multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain. This pipeline provides an efficient method for cellular and circuitry investigation of the whole macaque brain with individual-axon resolution, and can shed light on brain function and disorders.

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2-3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b-4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

This seems incompatible with the hypothesis that cells of the subplate (the lower component of the preplate in normal mammals) form an axonal scaffold that guides thalamic fibers and act as temporary targets for them (Blakemore and Molnar, 1990, Shatz et at., 1990). We used carbocyanine dyes to trace projections in wild-type and reeler mice between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 3. Preplate formation and early extension of corticofugal fibers to form a topographic array are indistinguishable in the two phenotypes. So too are the emergence of thalamic axons in topographic order through the primitive internal capsule, their meeting with preplate axons, and their distribution over the preplate scaffold. Distinctive differences appear after the cortical plate begins to accumulate below the preplate of reeler, causing the preplate axons to form oblique fascicles, running through the cortical plate. Thalamic axons then pass through the plate within the same fascicles and accumulate in the superplate layer for similar to 2-3 d, before defasciculating and plunging down to terminate deep in the cortical plate, creating the curious looping pattern seen in the adult. Thus, thalamocortical innervation in reeler follows the same algorithm of development but in relation to the misplaced population of early-born neurons. Far from challenging the theory that preplate fibers guide thalamic axons, reeler provides strong evidence for it.",cortex; reeler; development; pioneer axons; preplate; handshake hypothesis; thalamus; mouse; subplate; axon guidance; infernal capsule; DEVELOPING CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; ADHESION MOLECULES; TARGET SELECTION; EARLY INGROWTH; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEOCORTEX; MICE; RAT

Single or paired injections of anterogradely transported tracers, of varying anteroposterior extent, were made horizontally from behind in defined parts of the body representation in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and/or ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamic nuclei, and the distribution and density of labeled thalamocortical terminations were mapped in cortex. injections of increasing size in any dimension of VPL or VPM resulted in increasing accumulation of labeled terminals within the region of projection, implying extensive convergence of individual axons. Anteroposteriorly elongated injections labeled mediolaterally extended but anteroposteriorly restricted zones in cortex. Dorsoventral placement of an injection in VPL or VPM determined anteroposterior location of labeling in cortex. Dual injections separated mediolaterally or dorsoventrally by similar to 1 mm, and in different parts of the thalamic body or head-face representation gave rise to labeled thalamocortical terminations that overlapped extensively. For injection sites at different anteroposterior levels in VPL or VPM, the area of cortical convergence was related to their extent of anteroposterior coincidence. Labeled terminations arising from injections in immediately adjacent parts of VPL and VPM did not overlap in cortex. The extent of thalamocortical divergence and convergence revealed by these experiments is greater than that predictable from labeling of single axons and is sufficiently great to account for representational plasticity that exceeds the 1.5 mm cortical distance limit..",ventral posterior nucleus; area 3b; cortical plasticity; somatotopic representation; Phaseolus vulgaris; leukoagglutinin; fluorescent dextrans; FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; AREA 3B; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; AFFERENT TERMINATIONS; THALAMIC REGION; ADULT MACAQUES; NERVE INJURY

Here, we collected resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted MRI data before and after male rhesus macaque monkeys received extensive training to learn novel visuospatial discriminations (reward-guided learning). We found functional connectivity changes in orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, inferotemporal, entorhinal, retrosplenial, and anterior cingulate cortices, the subicular complex, and the dorsal, medial thalamus. These corticocortical and thalamocortical changes in functional connectivity were accompanied by related white matter structural alterations in the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and ventral prefrontal tract: tracts that connect (sub)cortical networks and are implicated in learning and memory processes in monkeys and humans. After the well-trained monkeys received fornix transection, they were impaired in learning new visuospatial discriminations. In addition, the functional connectivity profile that was observed after the training was altered. These changes were accompanied by white matter changes in the ventral prefrontal tract, although the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus remained unchanged.

In the oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task, monkeys needed to make a memory-guided saccade to the cue location, whereas in the rotatory oculomotor delayed-response (R-ODR) task, they needed to make a memory-guided saccade 90(o) clockwise from the cue direction. The directions of population vectors calculated from populations of cue- and response-period activities were similar to the cue and saccade target directions, respectively, which confirmed that population vectors represent information regarding the directions of the visual cue and the saccade target. We then calculated population vectors of delay-period activity using a sliding 250-ms time window. In the ODR task, population vectors were directed toward the cue direction throughout the delay. However, in the R-ODR task, they gradually rotated from the cue direction to the saccade target direction. Based on a comparison with the results obtained from DLPFC neurons, the rotation of population vectors started earlier in the MD than in the DLPFC, suggesting that the motor information regarding forthcoming saccade is provided from the MD.",information processing; population vector; prefrontal cortex; rhesus monkey; thalamus; working memory; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; FREE ARM MOVEMENTS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; VISUAL TARGETS; FRONTAL-LOBE

An important contributor to normal sleep patterns is a low-threshold calcium current mediated by T-type calcium channels. The T-type calcium current underlies burst responses in thalamic nuclei that are important to spindle propagation, and we recently observed that this current is sensitive to acute low doses of ethanol. Methods: We used a combination of current clamp and voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys that have chronically self-administered ethanol to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure may affect T-type currents. Results: Current clamp recordings from the LGN of ethanol naive macaques showed characteristic burst responses. However, recordings from the LGN in macaques that self-administered ethanol revealed a significant attenuation of bursts across a range of voltages (n = 5). Voltage clamp recordings from control LGN neurons (n = 16) and neurons (n = 29) from brain slices from chronically drinking macaques showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in T-type current kinetics or in the membrane resistance of the thalamic cells between the two cohorts. However, mean T-type current amplitude measured in the chronically drinking animals was reduced by 31% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure.

A central origin of tremor could arise either from a rhythmic activity of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) or from a structure such as the thalamus, outside the basal ganglia. In this study, single-unit recordings were performed in three 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated monkeys within the GPi and within three territories of the motor thalamus (delimited by their afferent inputs from the GPi, the substantia nigra and the cerebellum, respectively). For each recorded neuron, we compared the variations in firing rate and pattern in tremor and no tremor periods. Tremor either occurred spontaneously or was induced by external stimulation. When the animals entered into a tremor period we observed: (i) an increase in the mean firing rate in about half of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus; and (ii), a change from an irregular to a rhythmic discharge within the range of tremor frequency (5-7 Hz) in about 10% of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus (pallidal and cerebellar territories) and the GPi. Most of the thalamic neurons that exhibited a rhythmic discharge during tremor were found to be sensitive to external stimulation. Because the changes in firing rate occurred predominantly in the motor thalamus and not in the GPi, and because a fast rhythmic discharge of 10-15 Hz was frequently observed in the GPi and not in the motor thalamus, we conclude that thalamic activity is not a simple reproduction of basal ganglia output. Moreover, we suggest that thalamic processing of basal ganglia outputs could participate in the genesis of tremor, and that this thalamic processing could be influenced by sensory inputs and/or changes in attentional level elicited by external stimulation.",GPi; Parkinson; primate; thalamus; tremor; PRIMATE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; OCULAR MICROTREMOR; RESTING TREMOR; MACACA-FUSCATA; SPIKE TRAINS; 2 PARTS; DISEASE

However, recent findings suggest that behavioral patterns can be delineated on the basis of the four main arterial thalamic territories. The anterior pattern consists mainly of perseverations and superimposition of unrelated information, apathy, and amnesia. After paramedian infarct, the most frequent features are disinhibition syndromes, with personality changes, loss of self-activation, amnesia, and, in the case of extensive lesions, thalamic dementia; this pattern may often be difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially when neurologic dysfunction is lacking. After inferolateral lesion, executive dysfunction may develop but is often overlooked, although it may occasionally lead to severe long-term disability. After posterior lesion, whereas cognitive dysfunction with neglect and aphasia are well known, no specific behavioral syndrome has been reported. In the future, perfusion CT, functional MRI, and tractography using diffusion imaging in stroke patients may provide a better understanding of the role of the corticothalamic relationship in behavioral changes associated with thalamic stroke.",nan; PSYCHIC SELF-ACTIVATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; BITHALAMIC INFARCTION; COMMUNICATING ARTERY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; AMNESIA; MEMORY

Recovered, vs. nonrecovered, patients showed an enhanced ipsileisonal thalamic-contralesional cerebellar metabolic interdependency. This pattern correctly classified 91% of recovered and 88% of nonrecovered patients. Metabolic interactions involving bilateral supplementary motor area, ipsilesional thalamus, and contralesional cerebellum distinguished all recovered patients from age/sex-matched controls (N = 12).

A number of physiological studies have demonstrated that this projection causes a dramatic change in thalamic activity during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Additionally, the PER may mediate more subtle changes in thalamic activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state. The synaptic circuitry underlying these events has been identified in the cat thalamus. However, there is currently no anatomical information regarding the distribution of cholinergic receptors in relation to this circuitry To begin to understand how the PER projection modulates thalamic activity, we used immunocytochemical techniques to examine the distribution of muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors in the visual thalamus of the cat. The distribution of M2 receptors correlates well with previous reports of the distribution of cholinergic terminals in the visual thalamus. At the light microscopic level, dense M2 staining was seen in the neuropil of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus and in somata and proximal dendrites of cells in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). In the dLGN and pulvinar nucleus, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of M2 receptors using electron microscopy. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was used to determine whether M2 receptors are present on interneurons or thalamocortical cells. In particular, we examined the distribution of M2 receptors with respect to the known sites of PER terminations. The dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons were stained for the M2 receptors in both the glomerular and extraglomerular neuropil. However, the densest staining was found in glomerular GABAergic profiles that displayed the morphology associated with interneuron dendritic terminals (F2 profiles). Our data suggest that M2 receptors play an important role both in blocking thalamic spindle oscillations and in increasing the efficacy of signal transmission during increased attentional states.

Monkey specific 5HT1A (432 bp), 2A (411 bp) and 2C (294 bp) receptor probes were generated with PCR. Moderate 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal was detected in the preoptic area and the ventromedial nuclei. Less intense 5HT1A receptor signal was detected in a contiguous area from the dorsomedial nuclei through the posterior hypothalamus and in the supramammillary area. There was no change in 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. Dense 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal was morphologically confined to the paraventricular, supraoptic, and mammillary nuclei and the external capsule of the thalamus.

In summary, macaque 5HT1A, 2A and 2C receptor mRNAs are located in distinct hypothalamic loci which play a role in a number of autonomic functions and behavior. Ovarian steroids decreased the expression of 5HT2C receptor mRNA in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. The expression of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptor mRNA was not altered by treatment with ovarian steroids. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

After HRP injections into the head of the caudate nucleus we found retrogradely labelled neurons mainly in the intralaminar nuclei (nc. paracentralis, nc. centralis lateralis, nc. parafascicularis) and in the midline nuclei (nc. parataenialis, nc. centralis pars densocellularis, nc. centralis superior, nc. centralis intermedialis, nc. centralis inferior, nc. reuniens). Some labelled neurons were seen in the anterior thalamic nuclei (nc. anterodorsalis, nc. anteromedialis, nc. anteroventralis). In the ventral thalamus labelled neurons were seen in the nc. ventralis anterior (pars magnocellularis) and in the nc. ventralis lateralis (pars medialis). Some labelled neurons were distributed in the marginal parts of the nc. mediodorsalis. As for the caudal portion of the thalamus, labelled neurons were found in the nc. pulvinaris medialis and nc. limitans. The thalamocaudate projection is an exclusively ipsilateral projection system.

The DCS is of interest because of its role in directed attention and recovery from multimodal hemispatial neglect following cortical lesions of medial agranular cortex (AGm), an association area that is its major source of cortical input. A key finding was that the multimodal posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also contributes substantial input to DCS. This is significant because PPC and AGm are linked by corticocortical connections and are both critical components of the circuitry involved in spatial processing and directed attention. Other cortical areas providing input to DCS include visual association areas, lateral agranular cortex and orbital cortex. These areas also have reciprocal connections with AGm and PPC. Less consistent labeling was seen in somatic sensorimotor areas FL, HL and Par 1. Thalamic afferents to DCS are prominent from the intralaminar, ventrolateral, mediodorsal, ventromedial, laterodorsal (LD) and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. Collectively, these nuclei constitute the sources of thalamic input to cortical areas AGm, and PPC. Nuclei LD and LP are only labeled with injections in dorsal DCS, the site of major input from PPC, and PPC receives its thalamic input from LD and LP. We conclude that DCS receives inputs from cortical and thalamic areas that are themselves linked by corticocortical and thalamocortical connections. These findings support the hypothesis that DCS is a key component of an associative network of cortical, striatal and thalamic regions involved in multimodal processing and directed attention.

In 75% of the trials the visual cue correctly indicated which of the 2 acoustic signals would follow. In 25% of the trials the visual cue was misleading, readying for the wrong acoustic signal. Based on the visual cue the monkey could anticipate which acoustic signal would be presented, a possibility confirmed by behavioural analysis. Movements conforming with the acoustic instruction signals were reinforced. The activity of 65 medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and 107 primary auditory cortex (Acx) neurons was recorded during task performance. Significant response differences to anticipated vs unanticipated acoustic signals were found in 32% of the MGN and 27% of the ACx neurons. In both structures some of the affected neurons responded more vigorously to the correctly anticipated acoustic signals while others responded more vigorously to the unanticipated ones. An index of relative response intensity (RRI) was derived for each neuron by comparing its response to the sound signal in reinforced trials with that obtained in trials with no visual cues and no reinforcement (a 'blank' condition). For both MGN and ACx the analysis of RRIs revealed two anticipation-related effects. One consisted of response facilitation to anticipated sound signals together with suppression of responses to unanticipated sound signals. The other consisted of facilitation of responses to unanticipated sound signals, combined with base-line responsiveness to anticipated sounds. These effects can be interpreted to reflect a context-relevant trial by trial selection of neuronal channels which conduct information along the thalamocortical segment of the auditory system. The similarity between the effects of anticipation at the thalamic and the cortical levels suggest that the changes in excitability which underlay trial by trial neuronal selectivity occur subcortically.",nan; PRINCIPAL CELLS; BODY; CAT; ATTENTION; MODULATION; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; COMPLEX; BRAIN

Post-mortem anatomic studies have rarely investigated the thalamus in this population. Methods: Postmortem tissue was obtained from the left hemisphere of eight male schizophrenic patients and eight male age-matched control subjects, The optical dissector stereologic procedure was used to count neurons in the mediodorsal (MD) and anteroventral/anteromedial (AV/AM) nuclei of the thalamus. Results: The number of neurons and volume of the MD were significantly reduced by 35% and 24%, respectively. The MD cell number reduction was a consistent finding; every control subject had more and every schizophrenic subject had fewer than 3.5 million neurons. Neuron number was also significantly reduced (16%) in the AV/AM nuclei. Conclusions: The present data indicate that schizophrenia is associated with robust reductions in nerve cell numbers in nuclei that communicate with the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. These thalamic anatomic deficits may be responsible, in part, for previous reports of such prefrontal cortical abnormalities as reduced synaptic density, reduced volume, and metabolic hypofunction.

It has been proposed that this circuit is involved in signal processing and thalamic sensitivity regulation. Alternatively, Crick has suggested that the circuit could be a reverberatory loop--a site for very short term (iconic) visual memory. This hypothesis is shown to be plausible if the reverberation is keyed to the onset of neurally initiated visual disruptions such as blinks and saccades. Neural mechanisms suppress perception during these events but little is known about temporal filling-in processes analogous to the mechanisms that fill-in spatial scotomas. Crick's reverberatory loop could provide a process for filling-in temporal scotomas with information acquired just before the disruption, thus maintaining the continuity of visual experience.

However, little is known about possible structural alterations following amputation and chronic loss of afferent input in humans. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), based on high-resolution magnetic resonance images, we investigated the brain structure of 28 volunteers with unilateral limb amputation and compared them to healthy controls. Subjects with limb amputation exhibited a decrease in gray matter of the posterolateral thalamus contralateral to the side of the amputation. The thalamic gray matter differences were positively correlated with the time span after the amputation but not with the frequency or magnitude of coexisting phantom pain. Phantom limb pain was unrelated to thalamic structural variations, but was positively correlated to a decrease in brain areas related to the processing of pain. No gray matter increase was detected. The unilateral thalamic differences may reflect a structural correlate of the loss of afferent input as a secondary change following deafferentation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to the motor cortex, In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the lateral and interposed nuclei to the thalamus in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei. Terminals from the lateral nucleus were found to be located most medially in the thalamus, predominantly in the ventral lateral nucleus and the rostral pole of the posterior nuclear group. Terminals from the posterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the lateral nucleus, mainly around the border between the ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Terminals from the anterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the posterior interposed nucleus, predominantly in the rostral pole of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus. Terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei were also found in double anterograde-tracing experiments to be nonoverlapping in the regions between these main areas of termination. The structure of terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with thalamic neurones, were found to be similar. The terminals are large and form synapses with proximal dendrites of thalamic neurones. They contained round vesicles and formed multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, as well as dendritic spines. The findings indicate that information from the lateral and interposed nuclei is processed in separate regions of the thalamus but that the mode of synaptic transfer to thalamic neurones is likely to be similar for the two projections.

Methods: Twenty-six patients with mTLE who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy were included. Post-operatively, 13 patients became completely seizure-free and 13 showed residual seizure, regardless of frequency (five patients became almost seizure-free, six had rare seizures and two showed significant improvements). Degrees of hypometabolism in bilateral thalamus, ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal lobes were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively by determining the asymmetry index (AI), a value indicating 100 x (ipsilateral-contralateral)/[1/2x ( ipsilateral + contralateral)] and the region-to-cerebral hemisphere ratio (R/C ratio) being the ratio between averaged counts in each area and those in the cerebral hemisphere of the same side. Results: Hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe was visually observed in all patients. Hypometabolism in the lateral temporal lobe was observed in 20 patients and was semiquantitatively more prominent than that of the medial temporal lobe. Pathologically, hippocampal sclerosis and prominent astrogliosis of the lateral temporal lobe were present in all cases. However, while thalamic hypometabolism was visually observed in nine patients (in the ipsilateral side of four cases, contralateral side of three and on both sides of two), no significant thalamic hypometabolism was semi-quantitatively observed. No significant differences in metabolic rate in any area except for the lateral temporal lobe between seizure-free patients and residual seizure patients were seen semi-quantitatively. Discussion: Data indicated that metabolism in the lateral temporal lobe of patients with mTLE significantly decreased and revealed pathologic glial changes.

Schizophrenia is associated with reductions in thalamic neuronal number and cortical gray matter volume. Exposure of nonhuman primates to x-irradiation in early gestation has previously been shown to decrease thalamic volume and neuronal number. Here we examine whether early gestational irradiation also results in cortical volume reduction. Methods: High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult monkeys 1) exposed to irradiation during the early gestational period (E33-E42) corresponding to thalamic neurogenesis, 2) irradiated in midgestation (E70-81) during neocortical neurogenesis, and 3) not exposed to irradiation. Cortical gray matter and white matter volumes were derived via manual segmentation, frontal and nonfrontal volumes were distinguisbed via sulcal landmarks. Results: Monkeys irradiated in early gestation exhibited a trend reduction in nonfrontal gray matter volume (17%) and significant reductions in white matter volume in frontal (26%) and nonfrontal (36%) lobes. Monkeys irradiated in midgestation had smaller gray (frontal 28%; nonfrontal. 22% and white matter (frontal 29%; nonfrontal- 38%) volumes. Conclusions: The cortical deficits observed in midgestationally irradiated monkeys are consistent with a reduction in cortical neuronal number. Cortical volume reductions following early gestational irradiation may be secondary to reduced thalamic neuronal number and therefore model the thalamocortical pathology of schizophrenia.",frontal; magnetic resonance; neurogenesis; schizophrenia; thalamus; SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS; DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING GENERATION; FIRST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; TWINS DISCORDANT; VISUAL-CORTEX; OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS

They usually established several synaptic contacts - often in complex glomerulus-like synaptic arrangements - with dendritic shafts of large diameter and presynaptic dendrites containing pleomorphic vesicles. Postsynaptic targets of the PHAL-labelled CT boutons were characterized by postembedding gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry. It appeared that, in the LP1 of the cat, almost half (44.5%) of the postsynaptic dendrites to CT boutons from area 17 belonged to the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and the majority (41%) of these GABA-immunopositive dendrites were F2 terminals.

Lamina I terminations were identified by anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran, and 109 boutons on 38 terminal fibers were closely studied in series of ultrathin sections. Five unlabeled terminal boutons of similar appearance were also examined in detail. Three-dimensional, volume-rendered computer models were reconstructed from complete series of serial sections for 29 boutons on 10 labeled terminal fibers and one unlabeled terminal fiber. In addition, postembedding immunogold staining for GABA was obtained in alternate sections through 23 boutons. Lamina I TSTT terminations in VMpo generally have several large boutons (mean length = 2.16 mum, mean width = 1.29 mum) that are densely packed with vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts on low-order dendrites of VMpo neurons (mean diameter 1.45 mum). They are closely associated with GABAergic presynaptic dendrites (PSDs), and nearly all form classic triadic arrangements (28 of 29 reconstructed boutons). Consecutive boutons on individual terminal fibers make multiple contacts with a single postsynaptic dendrite and can show evidence of progressive complexity. Dendritic appendages that enwrap and invaginate the terminal bouton constitute additional anatomic evidence for secure, high-fidelity synaptic transfer. These observations provide direct ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that VMpo is a lamina I TSTT thalamocortical relay nucleus in primates that subserves pain, temperature, itch, and other sensations related to the physiological condition of the body.

Thalamic afferent terminals are preferentially labeled by an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2. The goal of our study was to determine the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in macaque and human visual cortex. First, we investigated the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in all layers of macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1), and found a very close correspondence between the known distribution of LGN afferents from previous studies and the distribution of VGluT2-immunoreactive (-ir) puncta. There was also a close correspondence between cytochrome oxidase density and VGluT2-ir puncta distribution. After validating the correspondence in macaque, we made a comparative study in human V1. In many aspects, the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in human was qualitatively similar to that of the macaque: high densities in layer 4C, patches of VGluT2-ir puncta in the supragranular layer (2/3), lower but clear distribution in layers 1 and 6, and very few puncta in layers 5 and 4B. However, there were also important differences between macaques and humans. In layer 4A of human, there was a sparse distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta, whereas in macaque, there was a dense distribution with the characteristic honeycomb organization. The results suggest important changes in the pattern of cortical VGluT2 immunostaining that may be related to evolutionary differences in the cortical organization of LGN afferents between Old World monkeys and humans.

To determine whether its anatomical abnormalities may be associated with cognitive deficits in the onset of schizophrenia, we assessed thalamic Volume, shape, white matter integrity, and their correlations with cognition in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. T1-weighted magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor (DT) images were collected in 49 healthy comparison controls (CON) and 32 patients with FES (FES). Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithms were used to delineate and assess the thalamic shape from MRI scans. The thalamic white matter integrity was quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) averaged over the thalamus using DTI. Our analysis revealed that FES did not differ from CON in FA and MID but did differ markedly from them in the thalamic volume and shape. Patients with FES also performed poorly in spatial working memory and executive tasks. The correlation study found that regional thalamic shapes highly correlate with the two cognitive scores in the entire sample and healthy comparison controls but not in patients with FES even though no correlation was found between the thalamic volumes with the two cognitive scores in any group. Left thalamic FA was correlated with spatial working memory deficits in FES. Our findings suggest that thalamic Volume and shape abnormalities are evident at the onset of FES prior to thalamic abnormal white matter integrity. Altered microstructural white matter integrity assessed using DTI may not be apparent in FES but may be observed as the disease progresses. Cognitive deficits related to spatial working memory and executive functioning in FES were observed in the context of loss of their normal relationship with the thalamic shapes, that is, regionally-specific thalamic shape compression is associated with poor performance in executive functioning and spatial working memory.

The trichromatic system of Old-World monkeys and humans has relatively few S-cones in the fovea. In this study, we investigated the distribution of putative S-cone afferents in macaques primary visual cortex (V1) which form a characteristic honeycomb arrangement in layer 4A. It was hypothesized that if there were a low number of S-cone opponent projecting neurons in central vision then this would be seen as a reduction in afferents in foveal layer 4A. Recent studies have shown that the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) is a marker for thalamic afferent terminals in cortex. The distribution of VGlut2-immunoreactive (-ir) terminals was studied in the foveal and perifoveal representation of V1. It was found that there was a substantial reduction in the terminal density in the foveal representation: the density was 5-6 times lower in the foveal V1 than in regions representing perifoveal eccentricities of 1A degrees-2A degrees and beyond. These findings may provide the cortical substrate of foveal tritanopia, the reduced blue perceptual ability for small fields in the center of gaze.",Thalamic afferents; Visual cortex; S-cones; Vesicular glutamate transporter; Macaque; COLOR-OPPONENT PATHWAYS; STRIATE CORTEX; COMPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION; MONKEY; RETINA; VGLUT2; REPRESENTATION; NEURONS; FIELD; COLOCALIZATION

Recent imaging studies of the thalamus suggest reductions in volume of the whole thalamus and reduced activity in the medial group of thalamic nuclei, which may indicate loss of functional input to the cortex. Using stereological techniques in six pairs of individually matched brains from schizophrenics and controls, we measured the volumes and obtained estimates of the number of neurons in the three subnuclei (parvocellular, pc; densocellular, dc; magnocellular, mc) of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and from the ventral posterior medial nucleus. There was a significant reduction in total neuron number in MD as a whole but this neuron loss was largely restricted to MDpc and MDdc [-30.9 and -24.5%, respectively (P less than or equal to 0.01)]. MDmc and the control ventral posterior medial nucleus showed no significant changes in cell number. Because the subnuclei of MD have different connections and project to different areas of the frontal cortex, the specific loss of neurons in MDpc and MDdc has implications for the functional defects observed in schizophrenia.",nan; NERVE-CELL LOSS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; PROJECTIONS; NEUROPATHOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY

In addition, stimuli inducing arousal also trigger a widespread electroencephalographic (EEG) response reflecting the coordinated activation of a large cortical network. Because functional connectivity between distant cortical areas is thought to be underpinned by trans-thalamic connections involving associative thalamic nuclei, we investigated the possible involvement of one principal associative thalamic nucleus, the medial pulvinar (PuM), in the sleeper's responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli. Intra-cortical and intra-thalamic signals were analysed in 440 intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) segments during nocturnal sleep in eight epileptic patients receiving laser nociceptive stimuli. The spectral coherence between the PuM and 10 cortical regions grouped in networks was computed during 5 s before and 1 s after the nociceptive stimulus and contrasted according to the presence or absence of an arousal EEG response. Pre- and post-stimulus phase coherence between the PuM and all cortical networks was significantly increased in instances of arousal, both during N2 and paradoxical (rapid eye movement [REM]) sleep. Thalamo-cortical enhancement in coherence involved both sensory and higher level cortical networks and predominated in the pre-stimulus period. The association between pre-stimulus widespread increase in thalamo-cortical coherence and subsequent arousal suggests that the probability of sleep interruption by a noxious stimulus increases when it occurs during phases of enhanced trans-thalamic transfer of information between cortical areas.",arousal; human; intracerebral EEG; nociceptive stimulus; sleep; thalamus; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; INFERIOR PARIETAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PAIN PERCEPTION; HUMAN THALAMUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

A previous study at the electron microscopic level in cat anterior TRN has suggested that synchronous bursting activity could result from the large number of presumably GABAergic dendrodendritic synaptic contacts. However, little is known about the synaptology of the monkey thalamic reticular nucleus and whether it contains dendrodendritic contacts. To address this issue, we examined tissue obtained from Macaca fascicularis that was prepared for electron microscopy using postembedding techniques to demonstrate GABA immunoreactivity. Examination of the anterior (motor) and posterior (somatosensory) portions of the TRN disclosed the following: The majority of synaptic contacts (87.5% of 958) were formed by axon terminals showing no GABA immunoreactivity and making asymmetric synaptic contacts on dendrites or cell bodies. A further 6.4% of synaptic contacts was composed of GABA-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals making symmetric contacts with the dendrites of TRN neurons. The majority resembled the pleomorphic vesicle containing F-terminals seen in the dorsal thalamus and known to originate from axons of TRN. A subset or possible second class did not resemble any previously described class of GABA-immunoreactive terminals in the TRN. Both classes of these terminals making symmetric contacts may originate wholly or partially within the nucleus. There was one dendrodendritic synaptic contact and only a small number (3.2%) of axodendritic contacts with synaptic vesicles visible both pre- and postsynaptically. We conclude that dendrodendritic contacts are probably not responsible for the synchronized bursting neuronal activity seen in the slow-wave sleep of monkeys, and that, if TRN neurons are coupled synaptically, the most likely mechanism is through the synapses formed by recurrent axon collaterals of TRN neurons onto TRN dendrites.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the DMFC has a topographic map coding final eye position, and to ascertain whether this region subserves the maintenance of eye position. The DMFC was stimulated electrically while monkeys fixated a target presented somewhere in visual space. A series of parametric tests was conducted to ascertain the best stimulation parameters to evoke saccades. Electrical stimulation typically produced contraversive saccades that converged onto a region of space, the termination zone. For some stimulation sites, however, stimulation produced ipsiversive saccades. This occurred when the termination zone was located straight ahead of the monkey. Convergence onto an orbital position was never observed during stimulation of the frontal eye fields (FEF), stimulation of which evoked fixed-vector saccades. The latency to evoke a saccade from the DMFC varied with fixation position, such that it increased monotonically the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. Moreover, the probability of evoking a saccade from the DMFC decreased the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. The latency for evoking a saccade and the probability of evoking a saccade from the FEF did not vary with fixation position. Horizontal head movements were not evoked from the DMFC while a monkey fixated targets presented in different positions of visual space. Moveover, changing the position of the head with respect to the body did not change the location of a termination zone with respect to the head. The DMFC was found to contain a topographic coding of termination zones, with rostral sites representing zones in extreme contralateral visual space, and caudal sites representing zones straight ahead or ipsilaterally. Furthermore, lateral sites represented zones in upper visual space, whereas medial sites represented zones in lower visual space. Once the eyes were positioned within a termination zone, further stimulation fixed the gaze and inhibited visually evoked saccades. Following release from inhibition, which occurred shortly after the end of stimulation, the saccades reached the visual target accurately. This shows that the stimulation delayed the execution of the saccades without actually aborting their execution. We conclude that the DMFC contains a map representing eye position in craniotopic coordinates, and we argue that this map is utilized to maintain eye position.",DORSOMEDIAL FRONTAL CORTEX; SACCADES; TOPOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL STIMULATION; RHESUS MONKEY; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; MOTOR AREA; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; OCULOMOTOR SYSTEM; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CENTRAL THALAMUS; GUIDED SACCADES; MOVEMENTS

In each experiment, single or multiple injections of various retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into adjacent regions or areas. In two experiments, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the lateral pulvinar, respectively. The results show that the thalamo-cortical projection from LGN to striate cortex and from pulvinar to the prestriate cortex are similarly organized, but the geniculo-striate projection is more precise than the pulvinar-prestriate projection. The pulvinar-prestriate projection is topographically organized and preserves topological neighbourhood relations. Projection zones to the various visual areas are concentrically wrapped around each other. The projection zone to area 18 constitutes a central core region. It begins ventro-laterally in PuL where the pulvinar is in contact with the LGN. This contact zone we called the hilus region of the pulvinar. The area 18-projection zone stretches as a central cone into the posterior pulvinar through PuL and into PuM. It is surrounded by the projection zone to the posterior belt of area 19 and this in turn is surrounded by the projection zone to the anterior belt of area 19. The projection zones to area 19 are then surrounded medially and dorsally by zones projectiong to the temporal and parietal association cortex, respectively. The projection zone to area MT is located medio-ventrally in the posterior pulvinar (PuIP and surrounding nuclei) and coincides with a densely myelinated region. Area 17 also receives input from the pulvinar but probably predominantly in the region of the central visual field. The pulvinar zone projecting to area 17 is located ventrolaterally from the central core region projecting to area 18 and is contiguous laterally with the LGN. If the positions of the vertical and the horizontal meridian in the pulvinar correspond to those in the respective cortical projection zones, a second order visual field representation such as found in area 18, with the horizontal meridian split at an excentricity of about 7-10-degrees, can also be recognized in the pulvinar.",PULVINAR; AREA-17; PRESTRIATE CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL ORGANIZATION; CALLITHRIX JACCHUS; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE HRP; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; ADJACENT LATERAL PULVINAR; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; OWL MONKEY

Although the two receptor subtypes show a markedly different distribution in the rat brain, their distribution in the primate brain has not been described previously. In this study, the neuroanatomic distribution of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor binding sites in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was assessed by using iodine 125 ([I-125)-Tyr(0)] -sauvagine with or without the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP-154,526-1. Radiolabeled human cRNA probes were used to map the distribution of the two receptor mRNAs with in situ hybridization. Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were found in the pituitary and throughout the neocortex (especially, in prefrontal, cingulate, striate, and insular cortices), amygdala, and hippocampal formation of the monkey brain. This is in contrast to the distribution of these receptors reported in the rat brain, in which generally only the CRF1 receptor is found in the pituitary and neocortex. These results suggest that, in primates, both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of CRF on cognition, behavior, and pituitary-adrenal function. The presence of CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptors within the locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamus, and striatum and of CRF2 (but not CRF1) receptors in the choroid plexus, certain hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus prepositus, and the nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests that each receptor subtype also may have distinct functional roles within the primate central nervous system.

Sensory information is believed to then propagate through the cortical column along the L4 -> L2/3 -> L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent strata of cortex in parallel.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BARREL CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; RAT NEOCORTEX; MOUSE; CAT; PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based probabilistic tractography of deep brain structures that are commonly used for pre- and perioperative targeting for functional neurosurgery. Three targets were reconstructed based on their significance as intervention sites or as a no-go area to avoid adverse side effects: the connections propagating from the thalamus to (1) primary and supplementary motor areas, (2) to somatosensory areas and the cerebello-thalamic tract (CTT). We evaluated the overlap of the reconstructed connectivity based targets with corresponding atlas based data, and tested the inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by acquiring repeated DTI from four volunteers, and on three MRI scanners with similar sequence parameters. Compared to a 3D histological atlas of the human thalamus, moderate overlaps of 35-50% were measured between connectivity-and atlas based volumes, while the minimal distance between the centerpoints of atlas and connectivity targets was 2.5 mm. The variability caused by the MRI scanner was similar to the inter-subject variability, except for connections with the postcentral gyrus where it was higher. While CTT resolved the anatomically correct trajectory of the tract individually, high volumetric variability was found across subjects and between scanners. DTI can be applied in the clinical, preoperative setting to reconstruct the CTT and to localize subdivisions within the lateral thalamus. In our pilot study, such subdivisions moderately matched the borders of the ventrolateral-posteroventral (VLpv) nucleus and the ventral-posterolateral (VPL) nucleus. Limitations of the currently used standard DTI protocols were exacerbated by large scanner-to-scanner variability of the connectivity-based targets.",diffusion MRI; diffusion tensor imaging; brain connectivity; cerebello-thalamic tract; functional neurosurgery; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; OF-THE-LITERATURE; PROBABILISTIC TRACTOGRAPHY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; VENTRALIS INTERMEDIUS; STEREOTACTIC ATLAS; RHESUS-MONKEY

The thalamus also receives inputs from basal ganglia nuclei (BG) involved in value-based decision making, suggesting a role in the value process. We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning. Our data indicate that single neurons in the posterior thalamus not only processed simple visual information but also represented historical values. Furthermore, our data suggest an SC-posterior thalamus-BG-SC subcortical loop circuit that encodes the historical value, enabling a quick automatic gaze by bypassing the visual cortex.",nan; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUITS; SUPRAGENICULATE NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL PROPERTIES; ORGANIZATION; NEURONS; CONNECTIONS; PROJECTIONS; PATHWAY

Reduction of thalamic neurons, a key feature of the neuropathology of schizophrenia, could also have a prenatal origin via disruption of thalamic neurogenesis. This study investigates whether craniofacial dysmorphology and thalamic neuron loss might be associated manifestations of a disruption in embryonic development. Methods: Thalamic neurons were deleted by exposing fetal macaques to x-rays during thalamic genesis (E3342). Another group of macaques was irradiated after thalamic genesis (E70-81). Body, head, and facial measurements were obtained from the early irradiated (EX), late irradiated (LX), and control animals at adulthood. Results: Head width, distance between outer eye edges, and ear width were smaller in EX macaques compared with control animals. The LX macaques exhibited only reduced ear width compared with control animals. Conclusions: These findings indicate that certain features of thalamic neuropathology and craniofacial dysmorphogenesis observed in schizophrenic patients may have a common etiology.

The first network consists of ten feedforward levels where a Poisson spike train with varying firing rate is applied as an input in layer one. Although the balanced state partially avoids spike synchronization during the transmission, the average firing-rate in the last layer either decays or saturates depending on the feedforward pathway gain. The last layer activity is almost independent of the input even for a carefully chosen intermediate gain. Adding connections to the feedforward pathway by a nine areas Pulvinar structure improves the firing-rate propagation to become almost linear among layers. Incoming strong pulvinar spikes balance the low feedforward gain to have a unit input-output relation in the last layer. Pulvinar neurons evoke a bimodal activity depending on the magnitude input: synchronized spike bursts between 20 and 80 Hz and an asynchronous activity for very both low and high frequency inputs. In the first regime, spikes of last feedforward layer neurons are asynchronous with weak, low frequency, oscillations in the rate. Here, the uncorrelated incoming feedforward pathway washes out the synchronized thalamic bursts. In the second regime, spikes in the whole network are asynchronous. As the number of cortical layers increases, long-range pulvinar connections can link directly two or more cortical stages avoiding their either saturation or gradual activity falling. The Pulvinar acts as a shortcut that supplies the input-output firing-rate relationship of two separated cortical areas without changing the strength of connections in the feedforward pathway.",feedforward network; cortical transmission; pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus; cortico-thalamo-cortical connections; asynchronous spike transmission; balanced network; SYNCHRONOUS SPIKING; STABLE PROPAGATION; SIGNAL PROPAGATION; NEURONAL NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-SYSTEM; FIRING RATES; MODEL; RELAY

Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MTC were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIP; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MTC to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MTC had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MTC to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups.

To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.",nan; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; PRIMATE GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MOTOR THALAMUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CORTICOTHALAMIC TERMINALS; RECIPIENT THALAMUS; CORTICAL AREAS; ARM MOVEMENTS; BASIC PROCESS

The selection of an appropriate target is first evident even before thalamic axons grow into the cortical plate: initially axons accumulate and wait below their cortical target area in a zone called the subplate. This zone also contains the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex, the subplate neurons. Here we have investigated whether subplate neurons are involved in the process of target selection by thalamic axons by ablating them from specific cortical regions at the onset of the waiting period and examining the subsequent thalamocortical axon projection patterns. Subplate neurons were ablated at the onset of the waiting period by intracortical injections of kainic acid. The effect of the ablation on the thalamocortical projection from visual thalamus was examined by DiI-labeling of the LGN days to weeks following the lesion. At two to four weeks post-lesion, times when LGN axons would have normally invaded the cortical plate, the axons remained below the cortical plate and grew past their appropriate cortical target in an anomalous pathway. Moreover, examination of LGN axons at one week post-lesion, a time when they would normally be waiting and branching within the visual subplate, indicated that the axons had already grown past their correct destination. These observations suggest that visual subplate neurons are involved in the process by which LGN axons select and subsequently grow into visual cortex. In contrast, subplate neurons do not appear to play a major role in the initial morphological development of the LGN itself. Subplate ablations did not alter dendritic growth or shapes of LGN projection neurons during the period under study, nor did it prevent the segregation of retinal ganglion cell axons into eye-specific layers. However, the overall size of the LGN was reduced, suggesting that there may be increased cell death of LGN neurons in the absence of subplate neurons. To examine whether subplate neurons beneath other neocortical areas play a similar role in the formation of thalamocortical connections, subplate neurons were deleted beneath auditory cortex at the onset of the waiting period for auditory thalamic axons. Subsequent DiI labeling revealed that in these animals the majority of MGN axons had grown past auditory cortex instead of innervating it. Taken together these observations underscore a general requirement for subplate neurons throughout neocortex in the process of cortical target selection and ingrowth by thalamic axons. Moreover, they imply that the cortical plate alone has insufficient information to direct the formation of specific sets of thalamocortical connections: interactions involving subplate neurons must also be present.",SUBPLATE NEURONS; CEREBRAL CORTEX; TARGET SELECTION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WHITE MATTER; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; CORTICAL AREAS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CELLS

The results show that the medial extrastriate region above the calcarine sulcus projects mainly to the lateral pulvinar (PL), medial pulvinar (PM), and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. In addition, the dorsal portion of the medial region has connections to the lateral dorsal (LD) as well as to intralaminar nuclei. The dorsolateral extrastriate region projects strongly to the PL and LP nuclei, to the PM and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei, and to the LD and intralaminar nuclei. The lateral extrastriate region above the inferior occipital sulcus (IOS) has strong connections to both the PL and PI nuclei and has minor projections to the PM and oral pulvinar nuclei. The ventrolateral extrastriate region below the IOS projects mainly to the PI nucleus and to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has some projections to the PM nucleus. The ventromedial extrastriate region medial to the occipitotemporal sulcus has strong connections with the ventral and medial sectors of the PI nucleus. This region also projects to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has minor connections to the LP nucleus. Finally, the annectant gyrus projects to the PL nucleus and to the rostral portion of the PI nucleus and has minor connections to the PM nucleus. Thus, the medial and dorsolateral extrastriate regions are related mainly to the PL and LP nuclei as well as to intralaminar nuclei. In contrast, the ventrolateral and ventromedial regions are connected strongly with the PI nucleus. This connectional organization appears to reflect functional differentiation at the cortical level.

This system is analysed by resorting to informational neuromorphology which deduces particular properties of information processing from spatial features observed on neuronal arborisations or sets of arborisations. The main part of the cerebro-cerebellar circuit is fine grained with relatively small arborisations. Such a fine grain is not used here for the preservation of a simple somatotopic representation, as is the case for sensory systems, but instead for a processing using << patchy maps >> which is a known mode of parallel processing. There is a major break of arborisations geometry which is situated in the cerebellar cortex between the granule and Purkinje cells. The grain cells axons, the parallel fibers, are numerous and almost unbranched while the dendritic arborisations of Purkinje's cells are flat, with a large surface and are perpendicular to the parallel fibers which leads to both a cardinal and a reception convergence. This is also observed in the striato-pallidal system. A significant difference between the two systems which are separated almost everywhere, notably at the thalamic relays level, is that the system passing through the cerebellum essentially processes sensorimotor information while the basal ganglia system receives information from almost the whole cortex. The return to the cortical targets causes complex interferences. It clearly appears that the two motor systems process information in different manners.",nan; PRECENTRAL MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; RHESUS-MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; ARCUATE PREMOTOR

Objective: To assess the beneficial effects of ANT stimulation on hippocampal neurons of epileptic monkeys. Methods: Chronic ANT stimulation was applied to kainic acid-induced epileptic monkeys. Behavioral seizures were continuously monitored. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays were performed to assess the hippocampal injury and the effects of ANT stimulation. Results: The frequency of seizures was 42.8% lower in the stimulation group compared with the sham-stimulation group. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analyses indicated that neuronal loss and apoptosis were less severe and that neurofilament synthesis was enhanced in the stimulation monkeys compared with the sham-stimulation group. These data showed that the hippocampal injury was less severe in monkeys in the stimulation group than in those in the sham-stimulation group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that chronic ANT stimulation may exert protective effects on hippocampal neurons and boost the regeneration of neuronal fibers. These effects may be closely related to the mechanisms of ANT stimulation in epilepsy treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although QSM has many applications in detecting iron deposits in the human brain, including the distribution of iron deposits in specific brain regions, the change of iron deposition with aging, and the comparison of iron deposits between diseased groups and healthy controls, few studies have applied QSM to non-human primates, while most animal brain experiments focus on biochemical and anatomical results instead of non-invasive experiments. Additionally, brain imaging in children's research is difficult, but can be substituted using young rhesus monkeys, which are very similar to humans, as research animals. Therefore, understanding the relationship between iron deposition and age in rhesus macaques' brains can offer insights into both the developmental trajectory of magnetic susceptibility in the animal model and the correlated evidence in children's research. Twenty-three healthy rhesus macaque monkeys (23 +/- 7.85 years, range 2-29 years) were included in this research. Seven regions of interest (ROIs-globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, red nucleus) have been analyzed in terms of QSM and R-2* (apparent relaxation rate). Susceptibility in most ROIs correlated significantly with the growth of age, similarly to the results for R-2*, but showed different trends in the thalamus and red nucleus, which may be caused by the different sensitivities of myelination and iron deposition in R-2* and QSM analysis. By assessing the correlation between iron content and age in healthy rhesus macaques' brains using QSM, we provide a piece of pilot information on normality for advanced animal disease models. Meanwhile, this study also could serve as the normative basis for further clinical studies using QSM for iron content quantification. Due to the comparison of the susceptibility on the same experimental objects, this research can also provide practical support for future research on characteristics for QSM and R-2*.",brain; iron content; QSM; rhesus macaque; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; DEEP GRAY-MATTER; IRON DEPOSITION; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MAPPING QSM; AGE; MRI; R-2-ASTERISK; GENDER

Throughout this so-called slow oscillation, cortical and thalamic neurons fluctuate between periods of intense synaptic activity (Up states) and almost complete silence (Down states). The two decades since the original characterization of the slow oscillation in the cortex and thalamus have seen considerable advances in deciphering the cellular and network mechanisms associated with this pervasive phenomenon. There are, nevertheless, many questions regarding the slow oscillation that await more thorough illumination, particularly the mechanisms by which Up states initiate and terminate, the functional role of the rhythmic activity cycles in unconscious or minimally conscious states, and the precise relation between Up states and the activated states associated with waking behavior. Given the substantial advances in multineuronal recording and imaging methods in both in vivo and in vitro preparations, the time is ripe to take stock of our current understanding of the slow oscillation and pave the way for future investigations of its mechanisms and functions.

The preferred stimulus orientation of these columns span the full range of orientations, as observed in recordings of spikes and in classical optical imaging of intrinsic signals. However, when we imaged the putative thalamic input to striate cortical cells that can be seen in imaging of intrinsic signals when they are analyzed on a larger spatial scale, we found that the orientation domain map of the primary visual cortex did not show the same diversity of orientations. This map was dominated by just the one orientation that is most commonly preferred by neurons in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus. This supports cortical feature selectivity and columnar architecture being built upon feed-forward signals transmitted from the thalamus in a very limited number of broadly tuned input channels.",visual cortex; thalamocortical inputs; orientation selectivity; optical imaging of intrinsic signals; radial bias; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; FOVEAL STRIATE CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; GANGLION-CELLS; NEURAL BASIS; PREFERRED ORIENTATION

Despite well described connections on a microscopic scale, derived from tracing studies in animals, little is known about the intrinsic anatomical connections of these nuclei in humans. This lack of knowledge limits not only interpretation of functional imaging studies but also estimation of direct effects of deep brain stimulation which treats diseases as different as epilepsy or major depression. Therefore, non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies are key to analyzing connectivity patterns and elaborate approaches to close this gap. For our study, we explored the structural connectivity of the MD thalamic nuclei and the CM/Pf complex towards five cortical and six subcortical regions by using a preferential fiber calculation. We found both thalamic nuclei to be preferentially associated to distinct networks: whereas the MD is preferentially connected to prefrontal and limbic cortical regions, the CM is linked to subcortical regions. The anterior insula was the only cortical region associated with the subcortical network of the CM and the cortical network of the MD comprised one subcortical hub, the caudate nucleus, suggesting an integrative role of these two regions. Adding to predescribed anatomical tract tracing connectivities in animal studies, our finding lends support to the existence of similar basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in humans and we could show a robust distinction of preferential connectivity for both thalamic nuclei.

Three patients had a lateral TL seizure origin, and 3 patients had mesial TL tumors. Bilateral TLE was assumed in 7 patients. Only in the patient group with MTLE (n = 11), the ipsilateral thalamic glucose uptake showed a statistically significant lower value when compared to the thalamus of the contralateral side (Wilcoxon paired sign test, P = 0.012). There was a more pronounced hypometabolism in right TLE compared to left TLE. A 'hypersynchronous seizure onset pattern' in ictal EEG was only seen in 6 (26%) patients (1 patient with bilateral, 5 with unilateral TLE).

To determine which GABAA receptor subunit proteins are found in the human thalamus we investigated the distribution of five major GABAA receptor subunits alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(2,3) and gamma(2) using immunohistochemical techniques. The alpha(1), beta(2,3)- and gamma(2)- subunits which combine to form a benzodiazepine sensitive GABAA receptor showed the most intense levels of staining and were the most common subunits found throughout the human thalamus especially in the ventral and posterior nuclear groups. The next most intense staining was for the alpha(3)-subunit followed by the alpha(2)-subunit. The intralaminar nuclear group, the mediodorsal nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus contained alpha(1)-, beta(2,3)-and gamma(2)-subunits staining as well as the highest levels of the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)- subunits. The sensory dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus contained very high levels of alpha(1)- and beta(2,3)- and gamma(2) -subunits. The highest densities of GABAA receptors found throughout the thalamus which contained the subunits alpha(1), beta(2,3), and gamma(2) included nuclei which are especially involved in the control or the modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuits and are thus important in disorders such as Huntington's disease where the GABAergic projections of the basal ganglia are compromised. In addition the majority of receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus contain alpha(3) and gamma(2) subunits whilst the intralaminar nuclei contain high levels of alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits.

In unoperated animals, the region of VPL representing the hand was characterized by relatively dense and homogeneous CO staining throughout the rostral-caudal extent of VPL. Counts of neurons in the VPL hand representation from adjacent thalamic sections processed for Nissl and GABA immunostaining indicated that there were approximately 261.4 neurons/mm(2) of which 78.4/mm(2) stained positive for GABA. GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were readily apparent throughout the VPL. By contrast, animals that received total removals of the postcentral hand representations showed a dramatic reduction in CO staining in the VPL, which was confined to the expected location of the thalamic hand representation. Counts of neurons in the affected region from adjacent sections that underwent Nissl staining and GABA immunostaining also revealed a dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons, with a smaller reduction in the number of neurons staining positive for GABA. Specifically, large to medium-sized (> 180 mu m(2)) GABA(-) neurons were virtually eliminated in the affected portion of the VPL, and the numbers of GABA(+) neurons were significantly reduced. The remaining population of GABA(+) neurons was typically shrunken, and no GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were observed in the affected region. The results obtained after subtotal ablation of the postcentral hand representations (only one postcentral area spared, 3b or 3a) differed from those obtained when total removals were made. Instead of virtually complete degeneration of medium-sized to large neurons throughout the hand representation in VPL, as was the case with total removals, after partial removals, we found alternating regions in the VPL hand representation that appeared qualitatively normal, or dramatically degenerated. Thalamic sections stained with CO revealed light, moderate, and darkly stained patches of label within the hand representation in VP, depending on the type of cortical ablation. The most dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons coincided precisely with the lightest staining CO patches. Interestingly, the only statistically significant reduction in the number of GABA(+) neurons occurred in the light CO patches. In the thalamic regions coincident with the dark and moderately stained CO patches, the number of medium-sized and large neurons decreased, but the number of GABA(+) neurons was comparable to normal. Optical density measurements of the dark patches also indicated a statistically significant difference from normal CO staining in this region. These findings indicate that following cortical damage, complex changes occur in thalamic circuitry. Interestingly, these changes are not confined to regions of the thalamus that have their major projection to the damaged region of cortex, but include thalamic regions in which the major projection is to undamaged regions of cortex. Thus, relatively restricted cortical damage has the potential to affect regions of cortex not directly damaged, through post-injury changes in thalamic circuitry. Such changes in neuronal circuitry, especially at the thalamocortical level, may serve as the neural substrate for the limited recovery of behavioral function often seen after strokes or head injury.

However, despite extensive research, uncertainty about the ideal target remains with many structures being underexplored. The aim of this report is to address a new target for DBS, the medial dorsal (MD) and the ventral anterior (VA) nucleus of the thalamus, which has thus far received little attention in the treatment of OCD. Methods In this retrospective trial, four patients (three female, one male) aged 31-48 years, suffering from therapy-refractory OCD underwent high-frequency DBS of the MD and VA. In two patients (de novo group) the thalamus was chosen as a primary target for DBS, whereas in two patients (rescue DBS group) lead implantation was performed in a rescue DBS attempt following unsuccessful primary stimulation. Results Continuous thalamic stimulation yielded no significant improvement in OCD symptom severity. Over the course of thalamic DBS symptoms improved in only one patient who showed partial response on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (Y-BOCS) Scale. Beck Depression Inventory scores dropped by around 46% in the de novo group; anxiety symptoms improved by up to 34%. In the de novo DBS group no effect of DBS on anxiety and mood was observable. Conclusion MD/VA-DBS yielded no adequate alleviation of therapy-refractory OCD, the overall strategy in targeting MD/VA as described in this paper can thus not be recommended in DBS for OCD. The magnocellular portion of MD (MDMC), however, might prove a promising target in the treatment of mood related and anxiety disorders.",nan; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE-DISORDER; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; STEREOTACTIC LIMBIC LEUKOTOMY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; CAPSULAR STIMULATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE

Knowledge of these connections in the human is a prerequisite for stereotactic neurosurgical approaches designed to alleviate movement disorders by the placement of lesions in specific nuclei. Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus.",cerebellum; pallidum; substantia nigra; proprioception; thalamocortical projection; human; monkey; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACACA-MULATTA; BASAL GANGLIA; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; REVISED NOMENCLATURE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS

Despite early evidence and theoretical proposal pointing to an implication of thalamic control in attention, most studies in the past two decades focused on cortical substrates, largely ignoring the contribution of subcortical regions as well as cortico-subcortical interactions. Here, we suggest a key role of the pulvinar in the selection of salient and relevant information via its involvement in priority maps. Prioritization may be achieved through a pulvinar-mediated generation of alpha oscillations, which may then modulate neuronal gain in thalamo-cortical circuits. Such mechanism might orchestrate the synchrony of cortico-cortical interaction, by rendering neural communication more effective, precise and selective. We propose that this theoretical framework will support a timely shift from the prevailing cortico-centric view of cognition to a more integrative perspective of thalamic contributions to attention and executive control processes.",Selective attention; Thalamo-cortical circuit; Pulvinar; Priority maps; Alpha oscillations; Neural gain; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SALIENCE-BASED PROGRESSION; HUMAN BRAIN; NEW-WORLD; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; PRIORITY MAPS

Neurons in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the somatosensory thalamus and in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) respond to vibrotactile stimulation with relatively slow modulations (similar to 100 ms) of their firing rate. In addition, faster modulations (similar to 10 ms) time-locked to the stimulus waveform are observed in both areas, but their contribution to stimulus detection is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether VPL and S1 neurons encode stimulus presence with similar accuracy and via the same response features. To address these questions, we recorded single neurons while trained monkeys judged the presence or absence of a vibrotactile stimulus of variable amplitude, and their activity was analyzed with a unique decoding method that is sensitive to the time scale of the firing rate fluctuations. We found that the maximum detection accuracy of single neurons is similar in VPL and S1. However, VPL relies more heavily on fast rate modulations than S1, and as a consequence, the neural code in S1 is more tolerant: its performance degrades less when the readout method or the time scale of integration is suboptimal. Therefore, S1 neurons implement a more robust code, one less sensitive to the temporal integration window used to infer stimulus presence downstream. The differences between VPL and S1 responses signaling the appearance of a stimulus suggest a transformation of the neural code from thalamus to cortex.",fast and slow modulations; neurometric; psychometric; rhesus monkey; flutter; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; FLUTTER-VIBRATION; DISCRIMINATION; NEURONS; STIMULATION; PERIODICITY; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; PATTERNS

Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance scanning, however, showed involvement of the rostral mesencephalon as well.

Nevertheless, the role of corticothalamic circuits in sensory processing remains a mystery. In the visual system, afferents from retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from LGN to primary visual cortex (V1) are organized into functionally distinct parallel processing streams. Physiological evidence suggests corticogeniculate feedback may be organized into parallel streams; however, little is known about the diversity of corticogeniculate neurons, their local computations, or the structure-function relationship among corticogeniculate neurons. We used a virus-mediated approach to label and reconstruct the complete dendritic and local axonal arbors of identified corticogeniculate neurons in the macaque monkey. Our results reveal morphological substrates for parallel streams of corticogeniculate feedback based on distinct classes of neurons in V1 and V2. These results support the hypothesis that distinct populations of feedback neurons provide independent and unique information to the LGN.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC NEURONS; SUBLAMINAR ORGANIZATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; LOCAL CIRCUITRY; RABIES VIRUS; BRAIN-STEM; LAYER-VI

The rabbit limbic thalamus may play an important role in these functions, but has not been studied extensively in terms of its cytoarchitecture, the topographical organization of its cortical projections, and differential transmitter regulation of its subnuclei. Therefore, the architecture, projections to cingulate cortex, and radioligand binding were investigated in the anterior, ventral, lateral, and midline nuclei of rabbit thalamus. The anterior nuclei are highly differentiated because both the dorsal and ventral nuclei have parvicellular and magnocellular divisions. Fluorescent dyes were injected into cingulate cortex to evaluate limbic thalamocortical connections. The anterior medial, submedial, and parafascicular nuclei project primarily to anterior cingulate cortex, while they have small or no projections to posterior areas. The ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei have a significant projection to dorsal cingulate cortex, including areas 24b and 29d. Projections of the anterior ventral nucleus are topographically organized, since medial parts of the parvicellular division project to rostral area 29, and lateral parts project to caudal area 29. The lateral nuclei and the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus project with progressively higher densities in the rostrocaudal plane of area 29. Finally, the magnocellular division of the anterior ventral nucleus projects almost exclusively to caudal and ventral area 29, i.e., granular retrosplenial cortex. Ligand binding studies employed coverslip autoradiography and single grain counting techniques. Muscarinic receptor binding was moderate for both pirenzepine and oxotremorine-M in the parvicellular anterior ventral nucleus, while in other nuclei, there was an inverse relationship in the binding for these ligands. Most notably, the anterior dorsal nucleus, which receives no cholinergic input, had very high oxotremorine-M and low pirenzepine binding, while the anterior medial nucleus, which receives a moderate cholinergic input, had the highest pirenzepine binding and very low oxotremorine-M binding. Muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors was highest in the anterior ventral nucleus, while it was at moderate levels in the anterior dorsal and lateral nuclei. The binding of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol to mu opioid receptors and 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin to delta opioid receptors were both high in the parvicellular and low in the magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus. The magnocellular division of the anterior ventral, the lateral dorsal, and the parafascicular nuclei had high mu opioid binding, while the lateral dorsal and lateral magnocellular nuclei had low levels of delta opioid binding. The submedial nucleus had moderate binding of both opioid compounds. These results suggest that the limbic thalamus in the rabbit is highly differentiated and has topographically organized connections to cingulate cortex. Some of these connections may mediate responses to noxious stimuli including those from the submedial and parafascicular nuclei. Finally, the ligand binding studies indicate that transmitter systems differentially regulate the various subnuclei within the limbic thalamus and may modulate different components of limbic thalamocortical circuitry.",LIMBIC SYSTEM; MUSCIMOL; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; ENKEPHALIN RECEPTORS; THALAMIC NUCLEI; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; NUCLEUS SUBMEDIUS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; RAT-BRAIN; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPINAL-CORD; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS

However, it is unknown whether these increases occur in the thalamic division of the auditory system, the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Furthermore, it is also unclear whether these age-related changes are specific to the macaque auditory system or are generalized to other sensory systems. To address these questions, the PV immunoreactivity of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) from seven rhesus macaques ranging in age from 15 to 35 was assessed. Densities of PV expressing neurons in the three subdivisions of the MGN and the six layers of the LGN were calculated separately using unbiased stereological sampling techniques. We found that the ventral and magnocellular subdivisions of the MGN and all six layers of the LGN increased their expressions of PV with age, although increases in the MGN were greater in magnitude than in the LGN. Together, these results suggest that the MGN shows age-related increases in PV expression as is seen throughout the macaque ascending auditory system, and that the analogous region of the visual system shows smaller increases. We conclude that, while there are some similarities between sensory systems, the age-related neurochemical changes seen throughout the macaque auditory system cannot be fully generalized to other sensory systems.",parvalbumin; thalamus; medial geniculate; lateral geniculate; monkey; geriatric; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CALBINDIN D-28K IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CENTRAL AUDITORY-SYSTEM; COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; CALRETININ IMMUNOREACTIVITY; POSITIVE NEURONS; MARMOSET MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; GABA; CONNECTIONS

The injections were placed in the forelimb and eye-movement representations of PMD and in the forelimb representation of PMV as determined by microstimulation mapping. For comparison, injections were also placed in the forelimb representation of primary motor cortex (MI) of two owl monkeys. The results indicate that both PMD and PMV receive dense projections from the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus, and sparser projections from the ventromedial (VM), mediodorsal (MD) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. Labeled neurons in VL were concentrated in the anterior (VLa) and the medial (VLx) nuclei, with only a few labeled cells in the dorsal (VLd) and posterior (VLp) nuclei. In VA, labeled neurons were concentrated in the parvocellular division (VApc) dorsomedial to VLa. Labeled neurons in MD were concentrated in the most lateral and posterior parts of the nucleus. VApc projected more densely to PMD than PMV, especially to rostral PMD, whereas caudal PMD received stronger projections from neurons in VLx and VLa. VLd projected exclusively to PMD, and not to PMV. In addition, neurons labeled by PMD injections tended to be more dorsal in VL, IL, and MD than those labeled by PMV injections. The results indicate that both premotor areas receive indirect inputs from the cerebellum (via VLx, VLd and IL) and globus pallidus (via VLa, VApc, and MD). Comparisons of thalamic projections to premotor and M1 indicate that both regions receive strong projections from VLx and VLa, with the populations of cells projecting to M1 located more laterally in these nuclei. VApc, VLd, and MD project mainly to premotor areas, while VLp projects mainly to M1. Overall, the thalamic connectivity patterns of premotor cortex in New World owl monkeys are similar to those reported for Old World monkeys. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus as a remote effect of surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred two postoperative MR imaging examinations in 125 patients after cerebral surgery were retrospectively reviewed, focusing on the presence of reduced diffusion in the striatum and/or thalamus. The distribution of reduced diffusion in the striatum was classified into 3 groups: anterior, central, and posterior. Reduced diffusion in the thalamus was also classified on the basis of the anatomic locations of the thalamic nuclei. Further follow-up MRI was available in all patients with postoperative reduced diffusion, and acute infarctions were excluded. The patient medical records were reviewed to evaluate neurologic status. RESULTS: Restriction of diffusion was observed in the striatum and/or thalamus ipsilateral to the surgical site in 17 patients (13.6%). The distribution of signal abnormality correlated with the location of the operation, in concordance with the architecture of the striatocortical and thalamocortical connections. Reduced diffusion was observed from days 7 to 46 after the operation, especially during days 8-21. The signal abnormalities completely resolved on follow-up examinations. The median follow-up period was 202 days (interquartile range, 76-487 days). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and/or thalamus likely represents an early phase of secondary neuronal degeneration based on its characteristic distribution and time course. Clinically, this reduced diffusion should not be mistaken for postoperative ischemic injury.",nan; MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; POSTISCHEMIC NEURONAL DEATH; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; AMPA RECEPTORS; MR; CORTEX

The cellular features which contribute to the functional specialization of its subsectors are poorly understood. In this study we determined the distribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in structurally and functionally distinct prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey. This class of neurons express nitric oxide synthase which is necessary for the production of nitric oxide, a novel neural messenger implicated in learning and memory. The density of diaphorase-positive neurons was approximately four times higher in olfactory areas than in eulaminate areas (areas 9, 10, 12, 46, and 8), and two- to three-times higher in the agranular limbic area PAll than in eulaminate areas. Positive neurons were concentrated in a deep band (layers V and VI), a superficial band (layers II and upper III), and were sparsely distributed in the central, thalamic recipient zone (deep layer III, layer IV and upper V). The highest densities of positive neurons were observed in the white matter where their prevalence Followed the opposite trend than in the corresponding overlying cortices. The distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons was correlated with the regional anatomic and functional specialization of prefrontal cortices. Thus, diaphorase-positive neurons were most densely distributed in orbital and then medial prefrontal limbic cortices which have a low cell density and widespread connections. In contrast, positive neurons were comparatively sparse in eulaminate cortices, which have a high cell density and more restricted connections. These findings indicate that the distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons in prefrontal cortices is not random, but is associated with the structural architecture and Functional attributes of these cortices. The preponderance of diaphorase-positive neurons in limbic cortices, which have been implicated in learning and memory, is consistent with the idea that nitric oxide may have a role in synaptic plasticity.",nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide; limbic cortex; memory; DINUCLEOTIDE-PHOSPHATE-DIAPHORASE; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; STRIATAL NEURONS; RAT STRIATUM; WHITE MATTER; SELECTIVELY RESISTANT

To compare the expression of cholinesterases in the human thalamus, the distributions of BuChE and AChE activity were studied by using a modified Karnovsky-Roots method. BuChE activity was present mainly in neurons, whereas AChE activity was present in both neurons and axons. There was intense staining for BuChE or AChE throughout the thalamus, with some nuclei primarily expressing one or the other cholinesterase. BuChE staining was most intense and widespread in neurons in the anteroventral, mediodorsal, ventral, lateral, and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. AChE was predominantly expressed in neurons of the anterodorsal, midline, ventral, intralaminar, and reticular nuclei. Many nuclei contained both cholinesterases. Considering the overall patterns of labeling in the thalamus for the two cholinesterases, there were both complementary and overlapping relationships of BuChE and AChE activity. Neuronal staining in the subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamus was predominantly positive for AChE activity. The distinct distribution of BuChE activity in neurons in the human thalamus is consistent with an important role for this enzyme in neurotransmission in the human nervous system. Furthermore, BuChE activity, like AChE activity, is found in certain thalamic nuclei related to cognitive and behavioral functions. Involvement of thalamic nuclei in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia suggests that BuChE could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these disorders.

By combining Bayesian model selection with dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, a novel analysis approach that allows inferring the causality between neural activities in different brain areas, we demonstrate that salient sensory information reaches the multimodal cortical areas responsible for its detection directly from the thalamus, without being first processed in primary and secondary sensory-specific areas. This direct thalamocortical transmission of multimodal salient information is parallel to the processing of finer stimulus attributes, which are transmitted in a modality-specific fashion from the thalamus to the relevant primary sensory areas. Such direct thalamocortical connections bypassing primary sensory cortices provide a fast and efficient way for transmitting information from subcortical structures to multimodal cortical areas, to allow the early detection of salient events and, thereby, trigger immediate and appropriate behavior.",anterior cingulate cortex; dynamic causal modeling; functional magnetic resonance imaging; insular cortex; sensory processing; CINGULATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PAIN MATRIX; COGNITIVE CONJUNCTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; ATTENTION; SYSTEM; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI

Quantitative evaluation of connections examined with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers indicated that both gyri received strong thalamic projections from the medial geniculate body (MG) and the lateromedial-suprageniculate (LM-Sg) complex, and a weaker projection from the posterior (Po) nuclei. On the basis of the connectivity patterns and cytoarchitectonic features we distinguished the anterior (CPa) and posterior (CPp) areas in posterior composite gyrus and the anterior (SA), dorsal (SD) and posterior (SP) sylvian areas. Afferents from individual thalamic nuclei were focused in distinct areas, forming dominant projections, and diminished gradually in the adjacent areas as non-dominant projections. The most prominent MG projection arose from the dorsal caudal (MGdc) nucleus. Its ventral subdivision sent a dominant projection into the SP and CPa, whereas the dorsal MGdc subdivision was connected with the SA, SD and CPp areas. The most substantial connections from the LM-Sg complex were directed to areas SA, SD and CPp, with weak connections to areas CPa and SP. A gradient of density of LM-Sg afferents was distributed in the opposite direction to that sent from the MGdc. The origin of the CPa and SP afferents in the ventral MGdc, like connections reaching the posterior ectosylvian cortex, suggest that these areas are related to processing of auditory information. In contrast, areas SA and Up, receive dominant projections from the polymodal LM-Sg, and therefore may constitute successive steps in a hierarchy of cortical areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates.

We examined the reliability of this marker in identifying and discriminating thalamic terminals in adult and developing ferret visual cortex. We studied brain sections stained for the transporter protein and/or anterogradely filled thalamocortical or intracortical axons, by using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Under light microscopy, VGluT2 immunoreactivity (ir) in adult animals [past postnatal day (P)90] and in neonatal animals as early as P27 formed a dense band in layer 4 and appeared as scattered puncta in layers 6 and 1. Confocal dual-labeling analyses of P46 and adult striate cortices indicated that VGluT2 was present in thalamocortical axons, suggesting that thalamic projections utilize this transporter during postnatal development as well as adulthood. In contrast, extracellularly filled intracortical axons failed to colocalize with VGluT2-ir, suggesting that no significant terminal population originating in cortex contained VGluT2 in layer 4. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that, in adult layer 4, VGluT2-ir was present in large terminals, forming asymmetric synapses. Similar to anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals, VGluT2-ir synaptic terminals were different from their unlabeled counterparts in terms of terminal area (0.6 vs. 0.3 mu m), synaptic length (486 vs. 353 nm), and preference for synapsing on spines (77% vs. 59%). Moreover, no significant differences were found between VGluT2-ir and anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals. Comparable similarities were also demonstrated at P46. These results indicate that thalamocortical terminals in layer 4 of visual cortex utilize VGluT2 and suggest that this marker can be used to identify thalamic axons specifically in adult and developing animals.

We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of V1 cortex between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different Lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque primary visual cortex rather than convergent evolution of these features.

Methods: Motor excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques and electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. Motor function was evaluated by the Nine-Hole-Peg Test and measurement of hand grip strength. The affected side was compared with the non-lesioned side and with an age-matched control group. Results: Patients had a loss of inhibition and an increase of facilitation in the motor cortex of the affected side. The silent period was prolonged and motor function was impaired on the affected side. Conclusions: A thalamic lesion can modulate motor cortical excitability. Significance: This study suggests that, under normal conditions, somatosensory afferents influence inhibitory and excitatory properties in the motor cortex.

Less than 25% of the superficial hSI projecting cells were putatively contacted by terminals of cervical enlargement spinothalamic neurons. These cells were primarily located in ventroposterior lateral, ventroposterior inferior and centrolateral nuclei. Although the number of superficial hSI projecting cells numbered less than 20% of the total hSI projecting cells, their patterns of location and their proportion of overlap with STT terminals within each thalamic nucleus were similar.

To optimize this approach, we proposed to study the involvement of this nucleus in a non-human primate model of mesial temporal lobe seizure. Two macaques were implanted with one chronic electrode into the hippocampus allowing to monitor the ictal activity. Neurons of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus were recorded with a microelectrode inserted acutely. To induce seizures, penicillin was injected into the hippocampus and neuronal activities of the anterior nucleus were analyzed during ictal and interictal periods. The effects of the chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus on the ictal hippocampal activities were studied and electron microscopy analysis was carried out to study morphological modifications induced in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results demonstrate that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is directly involved in the pathophysiology of induced seizures since: (1) Electrophysiological study showed an heterogenous excitation during seizure characterized by the appearance of 2 types of neuronal firing response; (2) chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus changed the severity of seizures; (3) morphological modification of the ultrastructure as well as a reduction of synapse density were observed within the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This study demonstrates that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the epileptic network activated during temporal lobe seizures and suggests that this nucleus would be valid target for seizure control using deep brain stimulation.

Here we test the functional and anatomical validity of this proposal by comparing data from diffusion tractography, cytoarchitecture and functional imaging. We acquired diffusion imaging data in eleven healthy subjects and performed probabilistic tractography from voxels within the thalamus. Cortical connectivity information was used to divide the thalamus into sub-regions with highest probability of connectivity to distinct cortical areas. The relative volumes of these connectivity-defined sub-regions correlate well with volumetric predictions based on a histological atlas. Previously reported centres of functional activation within the thalamus during motor or executive tasks co-localize within atlas regions showing high probabilities of connection to motor or prefrontal cortices, respectively. This work provides a powerful validation of quantitative grey matter segmentation using diffusion tractography in humans. Co-registering thalamic sub-regions from 11 healthy individuals characterizes inter-individual variation in segmentation and results in a population-based atlas of the human thalamus that can be used to assign likely anatomical labels to thalamic locations in standard brain space. This provides a tool for specific localization of functional activations or lesions to putative thalamic nuclei.",atlas; cytoarchitecture; diffusion imaging; FMRI; neocortex; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; PET

Here we show that of the two major types of excitatory neurons existing in L6, the NTSR1-Cre line selectively targets those whose axons innervate both cortex and thalamus and not those whose axons remain within the cortex. These corticothalamic neurons mediate widespread inhibition across all cortical layers by recruiting fast-spiking inhibitory neurons whose cell body resides in deep cortical layers yet whose axons arborize throughout all layers. This study reveals a circuit by which L6 modulates cortical activity and identifies an inhibitory neuron able to regulate the strength of cortical responses throughout cortical depth.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; INTERLAMINAR CONNECTIONS; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; STRIATE CORTEX; END-INHIBITION; AREA 17; CAT; CIRCUITS; RAT

All areas of the neocortex receive afferent input from and send efferent projections to specific thalamic nuclei. Through these connections, the thalamus serves to provide the cortex with sensory input, and to facilitate interareal cortical communication and motor and cognitive functions. In the visual system, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus is the gateway through which visual information reaches the cerebral cortex. Visual processing in the LGN includes spatial and temporal influences on visual signals that serve to adjust response gain, transform the temporal structure of retinal activity patterns, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the retinal signal while preserving its basic content.

However, their functional relationship remains to be elucidated. Here, we employ resting-state functional MRI to investigate the temporal correlations of spontaneous fluctuations between the thalamus [the whole thalamus and its three largest nuclei (bilateral mediodorsal, ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei)] and visual cortex under both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The whole thalamus show negative correlations with the visual cortex and positive correlations with its contralateral counterpart in eyes closed condition, but which are significantly decreased in eyes open condition, consistent with previous findings of electroencephalography desynchronization during eyes open resting state. Furthermore, we find that bilateral thalamic mediodorsal nuclei and bilateral ventrolateral nuclei have remarkably similar connectivity maps, and resemble to those of the whole thalamus, suggesting their crucial contributions to the thalamus-visual correlations. The bilateral pulvinar nuclei are found to show distinct functional connectivity patterns, compatible with previous findings of the asymmetry of anatomical and functional organization in the nuclei. Our data provides evidence for the associations of intrinsic spontaneous neuronal activity between the thalamus and visual cortex under different resting conditions, which might have implications on the understanding of the generation and modulation of the alpha rhythm.

It is divided into multiple subnuclei with different cortical connections. The medial dorsal (MD) nucleus is particularly important because it forms key connections with the prefrontal cortex. The current study reports precise and efficient methods for measuring the whole thalamus and the MD with MRI that have a high degree of interrater reliability. A multispectral image acquisition and novel image processing technique were used to improve structure visibility. The tricolor image assigns a color to each of the T1, T2, and PD weighted images, represented by red, green, and blue, respectively. The manually defined regions were then used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically define both. the whole thalamus and the MD.

One hundred 5-HT immunoreactive terminals from the cat and approximately forty 5-HT and TH immunoreactive terminals from the monkey were selected for analysis in serial thin sections. Only 7-10% of the immunoreactive terminals could be revealed to form conventional synaptic contacts. Most of these could be identified as the asymmetrical type. Dendritic shafts belonging to relay neurons were the major targets of these monoamine immunoreactive terminals. The remainder made intimate membrane associations with relay cell dendrites and somata or with presynaptic dendrites of interneurons, but no overt membrane specializations could be detected.

Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.",vision; plasticity; primate; thalamus; CELL-CYCLE KINETICS; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; WHITE-MATTER; BILATERAL ENUCLEATION; CALLOSAL CONNECTIONS; NEURAL FRAMEWORK; ORGANIZATION; DIFFUSION; ACTIVATION

In all of the tasks tested, T-maze alternation, radial arm maze, and Morris water maze, those animals with lesions placed in the contralateral hemispheres were more impaired than those animals with lesions in the same hemisphere.

Here we report the results of quantitative PET studies of cerebral nAChRs with 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 (2-[F-18]FA) in rhesus monkeys. Data from dynamic PET scans were analyzed using graphical methods. Binding potential (BP) values of 2.0, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.03 observed in the thalamus (Th), cortex (Cx), striatum (Str), and cerebellum (Cb), respectively, were consistent with the pattern of alpha(4)beta(2), nAChR distribution in monkey brain. The high value of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding in the rhesus monkey Th and low level of that in Cb compared with nonspecific accumulation of radioactivity in these structures allowed use of Cb as a reference region for calculation of BP and volume of distribution of specific binding (VDsb) in Th by graphical methods, both with and without the plasma input function. In contrast, estimation of 2[F-18]FA specific binding in low-receptor-density regions such as Cx and Str required assessment of nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VDnd) in a separate study and measurement of nonmetabolized radioligand concentrations in the plasma. For accurate quantitation of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding by graphical analysis, PET studies should last up to 7 h due to the slow kinetics of 2[F-18]FA brain distribution. Further, to avoid substantial underestimation in measured BP values the doses of administered 2-[F-18]FA should not exceed 0.1 nmol/kg body weight. The findings suggest that 2-[F-18]FA is a promising ligand for quantitation of nAChRs in human brain.",positron emission tomography; nonhuman primates; radioligand; in vivo binding; PET; RADIOLIGAND; TRACER

Their functional importance is largely unknown, but they have both corticothalamic and corticocortical connectivity and at least one subpopulation has been implicated in vascular regulation and sleep. Several other studies have reported that the density of WMNs in humans is altered in neuropathological or psychiatric conditions. The present investigation evaluates and compares the density of superficial and deep WMNs in frontal (FR), temporal (TE), and parietal (Par) association regions of four young adult and four aged male rhesus monkeys. A major aim was to determine whether there was age-related neuronal loss, as might be expected given the substantial age related changes known to occur in the surrounding white matter environment. Neurons were visualized by immunocytochemistry for Neu-N in coronal tissue sections (30 vim thickness), and neuronal density was assessed by systematic random sampling. Per 0.16 mm(2) sampling box, this yielded about 40 neurons in the superficial WM and 10 in the deep WM. Consistent with multiple studies of cell density in the cortical gray matter of normal brains, neither the superficial nor deep WM populations showed statistically significant age-related neuronal loss, although we observed a moderate decrease with age for the deep WMNs in the frontal region. Morphometric analyses, in contrast, showed significant age effects in soma size and circularity. In specific, superficial WMNs were larger in FR and Par WM regions of the young monkeys; but in the TE. these were larger in the older monkeys. An age effect was also observed for soma circularity: superficial WMNs were more circular in FR and Par of the older monkeys. This second, morphometric result raises the question of whether other age-related morphological, connectivity, or molecular changes occur in the WMNs. These could have multiple impacts, given the wide range of putative WMN functions and their involvement in both corticothalamic and corticocortical circuitry.",interstitial; morphometrics; non-human primate; aging; Neu-N; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; Y-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; VISUAL-CORTEX; DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY; INTERSTITIAL NEURONS; COGNITIVE DECLINE

Using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics, social status differences were found in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) WM and cortico-thalamic tracts, with subordinates showing higher WM structural integrity (measured as fractional anisotropy, FA) than dominant animals. 5HTT genotype-related differences were detected in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, where s-variants had higher FA than I/I animals. Status by 5HTT interaction effects were found in (1) external capsule (middle longitudinal fasciculus), (2) parietal WM, and (3) short-range PFC tracts, with opposite effects in dominant and subordinate animals. In most regions showing FA differences, opposite differences were detected in radial diffusivity, but none in axial diffusivity, suggesting that differences in tract integrity likely involve differences in myelin. These findings highlight that differences in social rank are associated with differences in WM structural integrity in juveniles, particularly in tracts connecting prefrontal, sensory processing, motor and association regions, sometimes modulated by 5HTT genotype. Differences in these tracts were associated with increased emotional reactivity in subordinates, particularly with higher submissive and fear behaviors.",diffusion tensor imaging; emotional behavior; nonhuman primates; prepuberty; social stress; DIFFUSION TENSOR MRI; GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; REUPTAKE TRANSPORTER; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PROMOTER REGION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MACACA-MULATTA; 5-HTTLPR POLYMORPHISM

As with a cable, spine neck resistance (Rneck) increases with increasing neck length and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the neck. A synaptic current entering a spine with a high Rneck will lead to greater local depolarization in the spine head than would a similar input applied to a spine with a lower Rneck. This could make spines with high Rneck more sensitive to plastic changes since voltage sensitive conductances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels can be more easily activated. This hypothesis was tested using serial section electron microscopic reconstructions of thalamocortical spine synapses and spine necks located on spiny stellate cells and corticothalamic cells from area 17 of cats. Thalamic axons and corticothalamic neurons were labeled by injections of the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized cats and spiny stellates were filled intracellularly in vivo with horseradish peroxidase. Twenty-eight labeled spines that formed synapses with dLGN boutons were collected from three spiny stellate and four corticothalamic cells and reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs. Spine length, spine diameter, and the area of the postsynaptic density were measured from the 3D reconstructions and Rneck of the spine was estimated. No correlation was found between the postsynaptic density size and the estimated spine Rneck. This suggests that forms of plasticity that lead to larger synapses are independent of spine neck resistance. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:20582066, 2013.

In addition, this view stales that striatal output reaches the basal ganglia output nuclei (the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GP(i))) via a 'direct' pathway and via an 'indirect pathway' which traverses the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP,) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the topographical relationships of GP(e) and STN, and their topographical relationships with the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, are still unclear. The present work reviewed primate data on the topographical organization of STN afferents from GP(e), and STN efferents to the pallidum, striatum and SNR, and examined these data with respect to a tripartite (motor, associative and limbic) functional subdivision of the striatum and pallidum. This examination indicated the following. (I) On the basis of its efferent connections, the STN may be divided into a motor and an associative territories, as well as a smaller limbic territory, each projecting to corresponding areas in the pallidum and striatum. (2) Efferents from GP(e) are in a position to contact subthalamic cells projecting to GP(i)/SNR, thus providing anatomical support for the existence of indirect pathways. (3) Moreover, given the tripartite division of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, the available data indicate the existence of indirect pathways connecting functionally corresponding subregions of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, as well as indirect pathways connecting functionally non-corresponding subregions. On the basis of the above we suggested that there may be two types of indirect pathways, one which terminates in the same subregion in GP(i)/SNR as the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion, and another which terminates in a different GP(i)/SNR subregion than the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion. We termed the former a 'closed indirect pathway' and the latter an 'open indirect pathway'. The application of these concepts to the surveyed data suggested the existence of three closed indirect pathways, each connecting the corresponding functional (motor, associative, and limbic) regions of the striatum, pallidum, STN, and SNR, as well as of two open indirect pathways, one connecting the associative striatum to the motor subregions of the basal ganglia, and the other connecting the associative striatum to the limbic subregions of the basal ganglia. While the organization of the closed indirect pathways fits the closed segregated arrangement of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, the organization of the open indirect pathways fits the recently suggested open interconnected scheme of basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry.

Most LGN neurons are monocular in that they are activated by visual stimulation through only one (dominant) eye. However, there are both intrinsic connections and inputs from binocular structures to the LGN that could provide these neurons with signals originating from the other (non-dominant) eye. Indeed, previous work introducing luminance differences across the eyes or using a single-contrast stimulus showed binocular modulation for single unit activity in anesthetized macaques and multiunit activity in awake macaques. Here, we sought to determine the influence of contrast viewed by both the non-dominant and dominant eyes on LGN single-unit responses in awake macaques. To do this, we adjusted each eye's signal strength by independently varying the contrast of stimuli presented to the two eyes. Specifically, we recorded LGN single unit spiking activity in two awake macaques while they viewed drifting gratings of varying contrast. We found that LGN neurons of all types [parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K)] were significantly suppressed when stimuli were presented at low contrast to the dominant eye and at high contrast to the non-dominant eye. Further, the inputs of the two eyes showed antagonistic interaction, whereby the magnitude of binocular suppression diminished with high contrast in the dominant eye, or low contrast in the non-dominant eye. These results suggest that the LGN represents a site of precortical binocular processing involved in resolving discrepant contrast differences between the eyes.",binocular; interocular suppression; lateral geniculate nucleus; macaque; monocular; vision; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; GAIN-CONTROL; MONKEY; SUMMATION; NEURONS; RIVALRY; COMPONENTS

Spike activity of 67 neurons (48 simple, 19 complex cells) was extracellulary recorded from area 17/18 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. A total of 107 subfields (on/off) were mapped by applying, a reverse correlation technique to the activity elicited by bright and dark rectangles flashed for 300 ms in a 20 x 10 grid. We found that the width of the (suprathreshold) discharge fields shrank on average by 22% during this 300-ms-long stimulus presentation time. Fifty-eight subfields (54%) shrank by more than 20% of peak width and only ten (less than 10%) showed a slight increase over time. The main size reduction took place 40-60 ms after response onset, which corresponded to the transition from transient peak firing to tonic visual activity in thalamocortical relay cells (TC). The experimentally obtained RFs were then fitted with the aid of a neural field model of the primary visual pathway. Assuming a Gaussian-shaped spatial sensitivity profile across the RF subfield width, the model allowed us to estimate the subthreshold RF (depolarization field, D-field) from the minimal discharge field (MDF). The model allowed us to test to what degree the temporal dynamics of thalamocortical activity contributes to the spatiotemporal changes of cortical RFs. To this end, we performed the fitting procedure either with a pure feedforward model or with a field model that also included intracortical feedback. Spatial and temporal parameters obtained from fits of the experimental RFs matched closely to those achieved by simulating a pure feedforward system with the field model but were not compatible with additional intracortical feedback. Thus, our results show that dot stimulation, which optimally excites thalamocortical cells, leads to a shrinkage with respect to the size of the RF subfield at the first transient response of visual cortical RFs which seems mainly due to a change in the thalamic firing pattern. In these experiments little or no influence from intracortical sources was observed, which, however, may play a role when using more complex visual stimuli.",thalamocortical response dynamics; cortical spatiotemporal receptive field dynamics; field model; depolarization field; discharge field; cat; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; CORTICAL-NEURONS; AREA 17; GENICULOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; ORGANIZATION

Activated macrophages and microglia in white matter along with the hallmark multinucleated giant cells are prominent features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and of several simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) models. While infected microglia have been demonstrated in HIVE, this feature is not routinely seen in experimental infections in rhesus macaques using SIV or chimeric simian/HIV (SHIV) strains, limiting utility in HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment studies. Here, 50 rhesus macaques were inoculated with the CCR5 (R5)-tropic SHIVSF162P3N virus by one of three routes: intravenously (n = 9), intrarectally (n = 17), or intravaginally (n = 24). Forty-three monkeys became viremic, 26 developed AIDS, and 7 (7/26, 27 %) developed giant cell SIV encephalitis (SIVE). Rapid progressor phenotype was evident in five of seven (71 %) macaques with SIVE, and expansion to utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 coreceptor switch) was observed in four out of seven (57 %). SIVE lesions were present in gray and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, and brain stem of affected animals. Lesions were composed of virally infected CD68(+), CD163(+), and HLA-DR+ macrophages accompanied by white matter damage, necrosis, and astroglial and microglial activation. Importantly, microglial infection was observed, which makes R5 SHIVSF162P3N infection of macaques an attractive animal model not only to study transmission and HIVE pathogenesis but also to conduct preclinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating HIV-1 from the central nervous system (CNS).",HIV; SHIV; Rhesus macaque; Neuropathogenesis; CCR5; Encephalitis; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HIV-1 INFECTION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; IMMUNE ACTIVATION; CNS PENETRATION; BRAIN; REPLICATION; MACROPHAGES

Calcyon mRNA is found to be abundantly distributed throughout the primate brain. In neocortex, moderately dense, diffuse signal is found in all areas, with increased intensity present in a superficial isodense band corresponding generally to cortical layers II and III. Increased intensity of signal is also seen in the pyramidal cell layers of medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. Calcyon mRNA is present abundantly in subcortical limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Moderate calcyon transcript expression is seen in caudate and putamen, with lower levels in globus pallidus. Thalamic nuclei, including the reticular nucleus, express low to moderate levels. Very dense expression is noted in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Numerous brainstem regions express this transcript, notably monoaminergic nuclei including the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe. The cerebellum has detectable levels of expression in both cortex and deep nuclei. Although calcyon is hypothesized as a means for D1-like receptors to modulate cross-talk with other neurotransmitter receptor systems, it is notable that abundant calcyon transcript is detected in brain regions not associated with D1-like neurotransmission, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta and other dopamine-synthesizing cell groups. A substantial proportion of this may relate to the reported association of calcyon with the D5 receptor, or in addition, may suggest that calcyon has a wider role as a regulator of intracellular signal transduction.

However, it is unclear how specific thalamic nuclei are affected by these changes in basal ganglia activity. The thalamic parafascicular nucleus (PFN) receives input from basal ganglia Output nuclei and directly projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), striatum and cortex; thus basal ganglia-mediated changes on PFN activity may further impact basal ganglia and cortical functions. To investigate the impact of increased oscillatory activity in basal ganglia output on PFN activity after dopamine cell lesion, PFN single-unit and local field potential activities were recorded in neurologically intact (control) rats and in both non-lesioned and dopamine lesioned hemispheres of unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats anesthetized With urethane. Firing rates were unchanged 1-2 weeks after lesion; however, significantly fewer spontaneously active PFN neurons were evident. Firing pattern assessments after lesion showed that a larger proportion of PFN spike trains had 0.3-2.5 Hz oscillatory activity and significantly fewer spike trains exhibited low threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts. In paired recordings, more PFN-STN spike oscillations were significantly correlated, but as these oscillations were in-phase, results are inconsistent with feedforward control of PFN activity by inhibitory oscillatory basal ganglia output. Furthermore, the decreased incidence of ITS bursts is incompatible with inhibitory basal ganglia output inducing rebound bursting in PFN after dopamine lesion. Together, results show that robust oscillatory activity observed in basal ganglia output nuclei after dopamine cell lesion does not directly drive changes in PFN oscillatory activity.

This atlas is based on multiarchitectonic parcellation in sections parallel or perpendicular to the standard intercommissural reference plane. The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR) were used as neurochemical markers to further characterize thalamic nuclei and delimit subterritories of functional significance for stereotactic explorations. Their overall distribution reveals a subcompartmentalization of thalamic nuclei into several groups. Predominant PV immunostaining characterizes primary somatosensory, visual and auditory nuclei, the ventral lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus (R), and to a lesser degree also, lateral part of the centre median nucleus, and anterior, lateral, and inferior divisions of the pulvinar complex. In contrast, CB immunoreactivity is prevalent in medial thalamic nuclei (intralaminar and midline), the posterior complex, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, the ventral lateral anterior nucleus, ventral anterior, and ventral medial nuclei. The complementary distributions of PV and CB appear to correlate with distinct lemniscal and spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and to cerebellar and pallidal motor territories, respectively. Calretinin, while overlapping with CB in medial thalamic territories, is also expressed in R and limbic associated anterior group nuclei that contain little or no CB. Preliminary analysis indicates that interindividual nuclear variations cannot easily be taken into account by standardization procedures. Nevertheless, some corrections in anteroposterior coordinates in relation to different intercommissural distances are proposed. J. Comp. Neurol. 387:588-630, 1997.

These neurones project predominantly to the primary motor cortex after relaying in the motor thalamus. Given a) that localised regions of the motor cortex control individual muscles which generally act about single joints and b) the relatively tight topographical arrangement of thalamocortical connections, it is reasonable to hypothesise that if cerebellar output neurones control single-joint movements they are likely to project to localised areas of the motor thalamus, whereas if they project to more widespread regions they are likely to influence movements involving multiple joints. In this context, we have examined the ramifications and terminations of single anterogradely labelled axons in the cerebellothalamic pathway of the rat. A total of nine axons were traced (by using a 100x oil objective) through serial sections from the caudal end of the thalamus to their terminations in the motor thalamus. Each of these axons gave off one or more collaterals which terminated in the intralaminar or other associated groups of thalamic nuclei, implying simultaneous activation of two functionally separate cerebellothalamic pathways. In the relay nucleus or motor thalamus, four axons formed either a single focal group of terminals or multiple groupings of terminals within a localised region, and five terminated over widespread regions including one which terminated bilaterally. These results show that a large proportion of cerebellar output neurones may be in a position to influence multi-joint or even bimanual movements.

Immunocytochemical analyses, combined with computerized morphometry revealed that in the visual and auditory systems of the bottlenose dolphin, calretinin and calbindin are the prevalent calcium-binding proteins, whereas parvalbumin is present in very few neurons. The prevalence of calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is especially obvious in the auditory system of this species. In both auditory and visual systems of the macaque monkey, the parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons are present in comparable or higher densities than the calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons. In some structures of the visual and auditory systems of the macaque monkey, the calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons are nearly absent. The prevalence of parvalbumin-immunoreactive over calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is particularly prominent in the visual system of primates. Thus, the dominant sensory systems in both aquatic and terrestrial mammals are enriched in specific phenotypes of calcium-binding protein-immunoreactive neurons. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mismatch response, or mismatch negativity (MMN), is a neurophysiologic response to stimulus change. In humans and other animals, the MMN may underlie the ability to discriminate acoustic differences, a fundamental aspect of auditory perception. 2. This study investigated the role of the thalamus in the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in guinea pigs. Electrodes were placed in the caudomedial (nonprimary) and ventral (primary) subdivisions of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus). Surface epidural electrodes were placed at the midline and over the temporal lobe. The MMN was elicited by a deviant stimulus (2,450-Hz tone burst) embedded in a sequence of standard stimuli (2,300-Hz tone bursts). 3. A tone-evoked MMN was present in nonprimary thalamus but was absent in the primary thalamus. Surface-recorded MMNs were measured at the midline but not over the temporal lobe. The correspondence between nonprimary thalamic responses and midline surface potentials, and between primary thalamic responses and temporal surface potentials, is consistent with data reported for the auditory middle latency responses in guinea pigs. 4. The results demonstrate that the nonprimary auditory thalamus contributes to the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in the guinea pig. Furthermore, the data indicate that the guinea pig is a feasible model for investigating central auditory processes underlying acoustic discrimination.",nan; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; MIDDLE LATENCY RESPONSE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; GUINEA-PIG; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; JAPANESE MACAQUES; GENERATING-SYSTEM; CORTEX LESIONS

Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and neighboring regions of IT cortex. Here, we used fMRI to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in four monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene versus face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.",IT; macaque; organization; retinotopy; scenes; vision; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; FIELD MAP CLUSTERS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX

The dopaminergic system is of particular interest due to its role in the development of cognitive function and mood as well as its suspected involvement in neuropsychiatric illness. Nonhuman primate animal models provide a valuable resource for relating neurochemical changes to behavior. To facilitate comparison within and between primate models, we report in vivo D2/D3 binding in a large cohort of adolescent rhesus monkeys. Methods: In this work, the in vivo D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability was measured in a cohort of 33 rhesus monkeys in the adolescent stage of development (3.2-5.3 years). Both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 binding were measured using [F-18]fallypride with a high resolution small animal PET scanner. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) was measured for all subjects and group comparisons of D2/D3 binding among the cohort were made based on age and sex. Because two sequential studies were acquired from a single [F-18]fallypride batch, the effect of competing (unlabeled) ligand mass was also investigated. Results: Among this cohort, the rank order of regional D2/D3 receptor binding did not vary from previous studies with adult rhesus monkeys, with: putamen>caudate>ventral striatum>amygdala similar to substantia nigra>medial dorsal thalamus>lateral temporal cortex similar to frontal cortex. The DVR coefficient of variation ranged from 14%-26%, with the greatest variance seen in the head of the caudate. There were significant sex differences in [F-18]fallypride kinetics in the pituitary gland, but this was not observed for regions within the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, no regions in the brain showed significant sex or age related differences in DVR within this small age range. Based on a wide range of injected fallypride mass across the cohort, significant competition effects could only be detected in the substantia nigra, thalamus, and frontal cortex, and were not evident above intersubject variability in all other regions. Conclusion: These data represent the first report of large cohort in vivo D2/D3 dopamine whole brain binding in the adolescent brain and will serve as a valuable comparison for understanding dopamine changes during this critical time of development and provide a framework for creating a dopaminergic biochemical atlas for the rhesus monkey.

In 2 monkeys, injections were centered on the lateral VTA with some spread into the substantia nigra, while in one animal the injection targeted the medial VTA with partial spread into the ventro-medial thalamus. Double-labeling with antibodies against transduced fluorescent proteins (FPs) and tyrosine hydroxylase indicated that substantial portions of transduced midbrain neurons were dopaminergic. Interestingly, cortical terminals were found either homogeneously in molecular layer I, or more heterogeneously, sometimes forming patches, in the deeper laminae II-VI. In the animals with injections in lateral VTA, terminals were most dense in somatomotor cortex and the striatum. In contrast, when the medial VTA was transduced, dense terminals were found in dorsal prefrontal and temporal cortices, while projections to striatum were sparse. In all monkeys, orbitofrontal and occipito-parietal cortex received strong and weak innervation, respectively. Thus, the dopaminergic ventral midbrain sends heterogeneous projections throughout the brain. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of subgroups in meso-dopaminergic neurons depending on their location in the primate ventral midbrain.",AAV; anterograde projection; dopamine; immunohistochemistry; Macaca fuscata; VTA; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; DOPAMINERGIC INNERVATION; TEGMENTAL AREA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REGIONAL-DISTRIBUTION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; NEURONS

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.",alpha; oscillations; intracranial EEG; laminar; thalamocortical; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; LAMINAR PROFILE; GAMMA; PHASE; EEG; CORTEX; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; MONKEY

However, it is becoming clear that given the same stress, some individuals are very vulnerable and will succumb to illness while others are more resilient and cope effectively, rather than becoming ill. This difference between individuals is called stress sensitivity. Stress sensitivity of an individual appears to be influenced by genetically inherited factors, early life (even prenatal) stress, and by the presence or absence of factors that provide protection from stress. In comparison to other stress-related diseases, the concept of sensitivity versus resilience to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction has received relatively little attention. The studies presented herein were undertaken to begin to identify stable characteristics and the neural underpinnings of individuals with sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction. Female cynomolgus macaques with normal menstrual cycles either stop ovulating (stress sensitive) or to continue to ovulate (stress resilient) upon exposure to a combined metabolic and psychosocial stress. However, even in the absence of stress, the stress-sensitive animals have lower secretion of the ovarian steroids, estrogen and progesterone, have higher heart rates, have lower serotonin function, have fewer serotonin neurons and lower expression of pivotal serotonin-related genes, have lower expression of 5HT2A and 2C genes in the hypothalamus, have higher gene expression of GAD67 and CRH in the hypothalamus, and have reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone transport to the anterior pituitary. Altogether, the results suggest that the neurobiology of reproductive circuits in stress-sensitive individuals is compromised. We speculate that with the application of stress, the dysfunction of these neural systems becomes exacerbated and reproductive function ceases.",Reproduction; Stress; Serotonin; Corticotropin-releasing hormone; Pro-opiomelanocortin; Beta-endorphin; Paraventricular nucleus; Thalamus; Amygdala; Cynomolgus macaque; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; PULSATILE LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; FUNCTIONAL HYPOTHALAMIC AMENORRHEA; ENDOGENOUS OPIOID-PEPTIDES; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC RESPONSIVITY; OVARIECTOMIZED RHESUS-MONKEY; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; 5-DAY ENDOTOXIN CHALLENGE; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA

Peak levels of radioactivity were measured in brain at 90 min after injection of the tracer. Accumulation of radioactivity was highest in the thalamus, intermediate in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, and lowest in the cerebellum. The ratio of specific to nonspecific binding (V-3) in the thalamus, estimated from the (thalamic - cerebellar)/cerebellar radioactivity ratio, reached a value of 6 at 4 h post-injection. Specific binding was reduced by subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg cytisine at 2.25 h after injection of radiotracer. At 2.5 h after cytisine administration, radioactivity in the thalamus was reduced by 84 %, in the frontal cortex, by 76%, and in the basal ganglia, by 57 % of the level measured at the time of cytisine administration, demonstrating that the binding was reversible. On the basis of these findings, together with other data indicating high affinity, receptor subtype selectivity, low nonspecific binding and lack of toxicity in animals, 5-[I-123]iodo-A-85380 appears to be a promising ligand for SPECT imaging of nAChRs in the human brain.

Many of these maps are arranged in a discontinuous or patchy manner. Similarly, thalamocortical projections arising from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body to the primary auditory cortex are also patchy. We used anterograde labeling and electrophysiological methods to examine the relationship between thalamocortical patches and auditory cortical maps. Biotinylated dextran-amine was deposited into physiologically characterized sites in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of New Zealand white rabbits. Approximately 7 d later, the animal was again anesthetized and the ipsilateral auditory cortex was mapped with tungsten microelectrodes. Multi-unit physiological data were obtained for the following characteristics: best frequency (BF), binaurality, response type, latency, sharpness of tuning, and threshold. Immunocytochemical methods were used to reveal the injection site in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body as well as the anterogradely labeled thalamocortical afferents in the auditory cortex. In 86% of the cases (12 of 14), entry into a thalamocortical patch was associated with a marked change in physiological responses. A consistent BF and binaural class were usually observed within a patch. The patches appear to innervate distinct functional regions coding frequency and binaurality.

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus in combination with a conventional tracer, we studied direct and polysynaptic inputs to the ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) and medial intraparietal area (MIP) in non-human primates, to identify possible sources of eye position and gaze signals. We found that these areas receive disynaptic inputs from the brainstem horizontal eye position integrator network (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, PH) via the central lateral and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei. Our findings provide the first demonstration that inputs from the horizontal eye position integrator reach cortical areas. We found important topographical differences between PH populations targeting MIP and LIPv that likely reflect transmission of different types of eye movement signals. LIPv receives projections from the ipsilateral rostral PH, which may transmit ipsilateral eye position signals. In addition to inputs from the rostral PH, MIP receives strong projections from the contralateral caudal PH, which may contribute to both eye position and velocity signals. Unlike the horizontal integrator, we found that the vertical eye position integrator network, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, does not project to these posterior parietal areas, in keeping with findings that the thalamic nuclei targeting LIPv and MIP receive almost exclusively horizontal oculomotor signals.",eye movements; monkey; rabies; spatial updating; transneuronal; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SACCADE-RELATED ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RABIES VIRUS; ALERT CAT; NUCLEUS-PREPOSITUS; OCULOMOTOR SYSTEM; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The results showed that the superior vestibular nucleus and the medial vestibular nucleus, especially its rostral-to-middle parts, project to the lateral part of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus (corresponding to the centromedian nucleus in primates), the transitional zone between the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VL) and the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus (VPL) (the region considered to be the nucleus ventralis intermedius of Vogt [Vogt C. 1909.

These results suggest that vestibular information is transmitted not only to the cerebral cortex (mainly area 2V and area 3a) but also to the striatum. They also suggest that vestibular activity may affect gaze control by means of vestibulothalamocortical pathway in addition to vestibule-ocular and vestibulopremotoneuronal routes. J. Comp.

However, few studies have investigated the neural sites where multisensory integration may occur. Therefore, we used electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to study a region of the rat parietotemporal cortex that responds uniquely to auditory and somatosensory multisensory stimulation. This multisensory responsiveness suggests a functional organization resembling multisensory association cortex in cats and primates. Extracellular multielectrode surface mapping defined a region between auditory and somatosensory cortex where responses to combined auditory/somatosensory stimulation were larger in amplitude and earlier in latency than responses to either stimulus alone. Moreover, multisensory responses were nonlinear and differed from the summed unimodal responses. Intracellular recording found almost exclusively multisensory cells that responded to both unisensory and multisensory stimulation with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and/or action potentials, conclusively defining a multisensory zone (MZ). In addition, intracellular responses were similar to extracellular recordings, with larger and earlier EPSPs evoked by multisensory stimulation, and interactions suggesting nonlinear postsynaptic summation to combined stimuli. Thalamic input to MZ from unimodal auditory and somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei and from multisensory thalamic regions support the idea that parallel thalamocortical projections may drive multisensory functions as strongly as corticocortical projections. Whereas the MZ integrates uni- and multisensory thalamocortical afferent streams, it may ultimately influence brainstem multisensory structures such as the superior colliculus. J. Comp.

V2 contains three sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions) and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well; terminal label in layers 3-4 was distributed in discrete patches with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and targeted both ''thick'' (Cat-301(+)) and ''thin'' GO-rich stripes, avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers 5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer 6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent thalamic input shared by the ''thick'' and ''thin'' CO stripes (which receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests another potential source of integration between the two cortical visual streams.",PRIMATE; THALAMUS; VISUAL CORTEX; NEUROANATOMY; EXTRASTRIATE; MONKEY; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; INFERIOR PARIETAL; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; PATHWAYS; SEGREGATION

Here we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that project via the thalamus to area 46 of the prefrontal cortex of macaques in comparison with the projections to the primary motor cortex (M1). After rabies injections into area 46, many neurons in the restricted region of the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of PIN neurons labeled from the M1. This defines an anatomical substrate for the contribution of medial cerebellar output to cognitive functions. Like the dentate nucleus, the PIN has dual motor and cognitive channels, whereas the AIN has a motor channel only.",acquisition; retention; cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway; CONDITIONED EYELID RESPONSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LESIONS; MONKEY; RABIES; PROJECTIONS; MEMORY; MOTOR; ORGANIZATION; ACQUISITION

Anterograde labeling of terminals was done with 2% WGA-HRP injections in the cervical enlargement; thalamocortical cells were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent tracers. In one experiment, the contralateral;primary somatosensory cortex hand region (hSI) was injected to provide a direct comparison with hSII thalamic label. Both labeled cells and terminal-like structures were visualized in single thalamic sections and their numbers and positions quantitatively analyzed. The number of labeled cells within 100 microns from the STT terminals were counted as overlapping cells. Four thalamic nuclei, ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior lateral (VPI), posterior nucleus (PO) and centrolateral nucleus (CL) combined to contain 86.5% of all hSII-projecting overlapping cells. Of all hSII-projecting thalamic overlapping cells, VPI contained the largest number (36.4% of the total)followed by the anterior portion of the posterior nuclear complex (POa; 20.4%), VPL (18.3%) and CL (11.4%). Results of the hSI injection show a different pattern of overlap in agreement with our earlier study. The relative distribution of overlapping cells was dependent on the antero-posterior position of the SII injections. The most anterior injections resulted in small numbers of labeled cells, with the majority of overlapping cells located in PO and CL. The more posterior injections resulted in overlapping cells mainly in VPI and VPL. The results indicate that, in the squirrel monkey, VPI, VPL, POa and CL relay nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the second somatosensory cortex.",THALAMOCORTICAL; SPINAL CORD; ASCENDING PROJECTION; NOCICEPTIVE; PAIN; NOXIOUS THERMAL-STIMULATION; CORTICAL AREA; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PRIMATE; NEURONS; 2ND; PATHWAYS; CELLS

In addition to the relatively well described age-associated pathologies that reduce sensory processing at the level of the cochlea and eye, multiple changes occur along the ascending auditory and visual pathways that further reduce sensory function in each domain. One fundamental question that remains to be directly addressed is whether the structure and function of the central auditory and visual systems follow similar trajectories across the lifespan or sustain the impacts of brain aging independently. The present study used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological assessments of auditory and visual system function in adult and aged macaques to better understand how age-related changes in white matter connectivity at multiple levels of each sensory system might impact auditory and visual function. In particular, the fractional anisotropy (FA) of auditory and visual system thalamocortical and interhemispheric corticocortical connections was estimated using probabilistic tractography analyses. Sensory processing and sensory system FA were both reduced in older animals compared with younger adults. Corticocortical FA was significantly reduced only in white matter of the auditory system of aged monkeys, while thalamocortical FA was lower only in visual system white matter of the same animals. Importantly, these structural alterations were significantly associated with sensory function within each domain. Together, these results indicate that age-associated deficits in auditory and visual processing emerge in part from microstructural alterations to specific sensory white matter tracts, and not from general differences in white matter condition across the aging brain.",auditory brainstem response; diffusion MRI; sensory deficits; splenium; thalamic radiation; visual evoked potential; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; STEM RESPONSE LATENCY; OLDER-ADULTS; HEARING-LOSS; RISK-FACTORS; CORTEX; IMPAIRMENT; PATHWAY; CONNECTIONS; VOLUME

Projection neurons were mostly medium-sized, with oval-fusiform or polygonal perikarya, few primary dendrites, and frequent somatic spines; local circuit neurons were smaller. Four basic types of synaptic boutons were distinguished: (1) Small- to medium-sized boutons containing round vesicles (SR) and forming asymmetric contacts, identified as corticothalamic terminals. (2) Heterogeneous medium-sized boutons with asymmetric contacts and round vesicles, similar to the so-called large round (LR) boutons, which were in part of cortical origin. (3) Heterogeneous CAD-positive small- to medium-sized boutons, containing pleomorphic vesicles and forming symmetric contacts (F1 type), which included pallidothalamic terminals. (4) Presynaptic profiles represented by CAD-positive vesicle-containing dendrites of local circuit neurons. Complex synaptic arrangements, serial synapses and triads with LR and SR boutons engaging all parts of projection neuron dendrites and somata, were seen consistently, whereas classical glomeruli were infrequent. LR and SR boutons also established synapses on dendrites of local circuit neurons. Fl boutons established synapses on projection neuron somata, dendrites and initial axon segments. Compared to other previously studied motor-related thalamic nuclei, differences in synaptic coverage between proximal and distal projection neuron dendrites were less pronounced, and the density of synapses formed by local circuit dendrites on projection neuron dendrites was lower. Thus, compared to other thalamic nuclei, the overlap of different inputs was higher on monkey centromedian cells, and centromedian inhibitory circuits displayed a different organization.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; VENTRALIS ANTERIOR THALAMI; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; TMB REACTION-PRODUCT; CELL-TYPES; SUBCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; PRESYNAPTIC DENDRITES; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS

In neurodegenerative disorders termed tauopathies, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular inclusions. Rhesus macaques are widely used for studying ageing processes and modeling neurodegenerative disorders, yet little is known about endogenous tau expression in their brains. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to map and characterize total tau, 3R- and 4R-tau isoforms, and phosphorylated tau (pThr231-tau and pSer202/Thr205-tau/AT8) expression bilaterally in 16 brain regions of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian adult rhesus macaques. Tau-immunoreactivity (-ir), including both 3R and 4R isoforms, was observed throughout the brain, with varying regional intensities. The anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus displayed the most robust tau-ir, while the subthalamic nucleus and white matter regions had minimal expression. Tau was present in neurons of gray matter regions; it was preferentially observed in fibers of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and in cell bodies of the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. In white matter regions, tau was abundantly present in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, neuronal pThr231-tau-ir was abundant in all brain regions, but not AT8-ir. Differences in regional and intracellular protein expression were not detected between control subjects and both brain hemispheres of MPTP-treated animals. Specifically, tau-ir in the substantia nigra of all subjects colocalized with GABAergic neurons. Overall, this report provides an in-depth characterization of tau expression in the rhesus macaque brain to facilitate future investigations for understanding and modeling tau pathology in this species.",hippocampus; macaque; MPTP; phosphorylated tau; substantia nigra; tau; white matter; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PROTEIN-TAU; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PROCESS OUTGROWTH; PATHOLOGY; LOCALIZATION; DEGENERATION

The model clarifies how bottom-up and top-down processes work together to realize this goal, notably how processes of learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony are coordinated. The model hereby clarifies, for the first time, how the following levels of brain organization coexist to realize cognitive processing properties that regulate fast learning and stable memory of brain representations: single-cell properties, such as spiking dynamics, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and acetylcholine modulation; detailed laminar thalamic and cortical circuit designs and their interactions; aggregate cell recordings, such as current source densities and local field potentials; and single-cell and large-scale inter-areal oscillations in the gamma and beta frequency domains. In particular, the model predicts how laminar circuits of multiple cortical areas interact with primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific thalamic nuclei to carry out attentive visual learning and information processing. The model simulates how synchronization of neuronal spiking occurs within and across brain regions, and triggers STDP. Matches between bottom-up adaptively filtered input patterns and learned top-down expectations cause gamma oscillations that support attention, resonance, learning, and consciousness. Mismatches inhibit learning while causing beta oscillations during reset and hypothesis testing operations that are initiated in the deeper cortical layers. The generality of learned recognition codes is controlled by a vigilance process mediated by acetylcholine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed that corticothalamic input is essential for the development of thalamocortical projections, but less is known about the potential role of this reciprocal connection in the development of retinal projections. Here, we show a deficit of retinal innervation in the dLGN around E18.5 in Tra2 beta conditional knockout (cKO) cortexless mice, an age when apoptosis occurs along the thalamocortical tract and in some dLGN neurons. In vivo electrophysiology experiments in the dLGN further confirmed the loss of functional retinal input. Experiments with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced V1 lesion as well as Fezf2 cKO mice confirmed that the disruption of connections between the dLGN and V1 lead to abnormal retinal projections to the dLGN. Interestingly, retinal projections to the ventral Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (vLGN) and Superior Colliculus (SC) were normal in all 3 mice models. Finally, we show that the cortexless mice had worse performance than control mice in a go-no go task with visual cues.

Only 5-10% of the inputs to geniculate relay cells derive from retina, which is the driving input. The rest, being modulatory, derive from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from visual cortex, and ascending inputs from brainstem. The nonretinal, modulatory inputs, which form the vast majority, dynamically control the nature of the geniculate relay. Among other actions, these modulatory inputs regulate membrane properties of relay cells and thereby control their mode of response to retinal inputs, and this dramatically affects the nature of information relayed to cortex. Our studies of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat lead to the speculation that this dynamic control depends on the animal's behavioral state and represents the neuronal substrate for many forms of visual attention. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to cortex for the first time. In contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar (and lateral posterior nucleus in carnivores), is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it seems to relay information from one cortical area to another. Much more corticocortical processing may involve these 're-entry' routes than has been hitherto appreciated.

This study examined the possibility that the TRN is involved in covert orienting of attention. Attention can be summoned to a spatial location in the absence of an overt orienting response. The reaction time to a visual target is faster when attention has been drawn to the location of the target by a preceding cue in that location (valid cue) compared with when the cue misdirects attention (invalid cue) away from the location of the subsequent target. This reaction time difference is referred to as the validity effect. Rats were trained to perform such a reaction time task with visual cues and targets presented in poke holes to either side of the rat's head, which had to be maintained centrally and still. If the rat made an overt orienting response to the cue, the trial was aborted. Unilateral lesions were made by injection of ibotenic acid in the TRN. After surgery, there was no bias apparent in their responding; they were as likely to initiate responses and were equally accurate to either side. There was, however, a complete abolition of the validity effect for responses to contralateral targets.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years, rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models, a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models, cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover, some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models, a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore, we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys, the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter, a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models, the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore, the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months, such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently, brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore, the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.",Animal model; Brain imaging; Plasticity; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; nan

None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP used significantly affected the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF as determined by Raichle's (H2O)-O-15 method), and 10 mg/kg of R-THBP had little effect on the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) in the Rhesus monkey brain, as assessed by the graphical [F-18]fluoro-deoxyglucose method. The effect of R-THBP on the muscarinic cholinergic system was dose dependent; while 3 mg/kg of R-THBP did not significantly alter the uptake ratio of N-[C-11]methyl-benztropine in several brain regions to that in the cerebellum, 10 and 30 mg/kg of R-THBP significantly reduced the uptake ratio in the thalamus, as well as in the frontal and temporal cortices. None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP tested affected [C-11]SCH23390 (dopamine D-1 receptor) binding. However, the k3 value for N-[C-11]methyl-spiperone (dopamine D-2 receptor) binding, which represents the association rate x B-max value, was significantly decreased in the striatum. The uptake ratio of (+)[C-11]UH232 (dopamine D-3 receptor) in the striatum to that in the cerebellum was also decreased by administration of R-THBP (3 and 30 mg/kg i.v.). These findings suggest that R-THBP acts on dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors selectively without markedly affecting dopamine D-1 receptor binding. Furthermore, the changes in cholinergic and dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors in vivo can not be attributed to a change in rCBF but may depend on the action of R-THBP.","tetrahydrobiopterin; muscarinic cholinergic receptor; dopamine D-1, D-2, D-3 receptors; positron emission tomography; monkey brain; HUMAN-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PASSIVE-AVOIDANCE; INVITRO BINDING; TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN; PET; ENHANCEMENT"

We have begun studies of the monkey visual system to investigate the location and nature of these changes as well as to answer general questions about the effects of aging on neural structure and function. We began with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) because it is the main structure through which visual information passes on the way to cortex and because the parallel parvicellular and magnocellular pathways are most easily identified and studied in the LGN. In the present experiment, we determined the sizes, densities, and numbers of LGN neurons in young-adult (5 to 12.5 years) and old (23 to 27.5 years) rhesus monkeys. The measures were corrected for tissue shrinkage, and stereological procedures were used that yield unbiased estimates. In young-adult monkeys, neuron densities were lower in the magnocellular layers (about 14,000/mm3) than in the parvicellular layers (23,000/mm3). Neuron density increased about 28% from anterior to posterior in both types of layers. There was an average of approximately 1,267,000 neurons in the parvicellular layers and 148,000 neurons in the magnocellular layers; however, there was substantial variability (1.9-fold) among five brains studied. Aging produced a statistically significant decrease in neuron density in both the magnocellular (29% average decrease) and parvicellular (41% average decrease) layers. However, there was no significant loss of neurons. Rather, the density decrease was due to a small (nonsignificant) decrease in the number of neurons combined with a small (nonsignificant) increase in LGN volume. The increase in LGN volume was due to a significant increase in neuron soma-size and proportional increases in the volume of glial cells, blood vessels, and neuropil. These results, together with those of other studies, suggest that the effects of aging on the primate visual pathway from retina through striate cortex are relatively subtle. It is possible that the major neural changes occur more centrally. Alternatively, individual differences in the effects of aging may require much larger samples or prior screening to observe consistent changes.

Studies already demonstrated that the pharmacological disinhibition of the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic GPe produced dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical regions altered by the disinhibition of each GPe functional territory. Thus, 5 macaques were injected with bicuculline in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic sites of the GPe producing dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, and underwent in vivo positron tomography with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to identify cortical dysfunctions related to GPe disinhibition. Blood cortisol levels were also quantified as a biomarker of anxiety for each condition. Our results showed that pallidal bicuculline injections in anesthetized animals reproducibly modified the activity of specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas depending on the pallidal territory targeted. Bicuculline injections in the limbic GPe led to increased ipsilateral activations in limbic cortical regions (anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). Injections in the associative vs. sensorimotor GPe increased the activity in the ipsilateral midcingulate vs. somatosensory and parietal cortices. Moreover, bicuculline injections increased blood cortisol levels only in animals injected in their limbic GPe. These are the first functional results supporting the model of opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops where modifications in a functional pallidal territory can impact cortical activities of the same functional territory but also cortical activities of other functional territories. This highlights the importance of the GPe as a crucial node in the top-down control of the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits from the frontal cortex to influence the perception, attention, and emotional processes at downstream (or non-frontal) cortical levels. Finally, we showed the implication of the ventral pallidum with the amygdala and the insular cortex in a circuit related to aversive processing that should be crucial for the production of anxious disorders.",External globus pallidus; Cortex; PET imaging; Opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops; Aversive processing; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MONKEY GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROJECTION NEURONS; MOTOR CONTROL

We employed a triple-labeling technique in the same owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The cerebellothalamic projections were labeled with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the pallidothalamic projections were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine. The pre-SMA was identified by location and movement patterns evoked by intracortical microstimulation and injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Brain sections were processed sequentially using different chromogens to visualize all three tracers in the same section. Alternate sections were processed for Nissl cytoarchitecture or acetylcholinesterase chemoarchitecture for nuclear boundaries. The cerebellar nuclei primarily projected to posterior (VLp), medial (VLx), and dorsal (VLd) divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus; the pallidum largely projected to the anterior division (VLa) of the ventral lateral nucleus and the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). However, we also found zones of overlapping projections, as well as interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label, particularly in border regions of the VLa and VApc. Thalamic neurons labeled by pre-SMA injections occupied a wide band and were especially concentrated in the VLx and VApc, cerebellar and pallidal territories, respectively. Labeled thalamocortical neurons overlapped cerebellar inputs in the VLd and VApc and overlapped pallidal inputs in the VLa and the ventral medial nucleus. The results demonstrate that inputs from both the cerebellum and globus pallidus are relayed to the pre-SMA. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:164-180, 2000.

Focal iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer, biocytin, were made into the vMGB of neonatal rabbits to examine the morphological organization of auditory thalamocortical (TC) afferents prior to hearing onset. TC afferents terminated in distinct patches as early as postnatal day 1 (PD-0 = day of birth), 6 days before the behavioral onset of hearing. In contrast to TC afferents in adults, the terminal arbors of neonatal vMGB axons occupied the entire depth of the cortical plate and lamina I. Serial section reconstructions revealed that single vMGB axons in neonates branched to form multiple patches within the cortical plate. Collaterals also extended to lamina I where they coursed tangentially for several millimeters. An unusual feature of the neonatal TC patches was the contribution of descending collaterals from axons coursing in lamina I. The presence of distinct patches prior to hearing onset indicates that the segregation of auditory TC axons occurs in the absence of acoustically driven activity.

Viral antigen was found in all cell layers of the cerebellum, the gray matter of the thalamus and brainstem, and the ventral horn of all levels of the spinal cord. Staining was limited to neurons and their processes. Histopathologic changes were limited to the nervous system and characterized by nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis.

In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons; in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has, however, not been thoroughly examined in terms of this complex structure, which has connections with most brain regions of central interest in schizophrenia research. The aim of the present study was to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. Method: The authors used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]FLB457 to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in thalamic subregions of 10 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. Binding potential was calculated by the reference tissue method and used as an index for dopamine D-2 receptor binding. Comparisons were made with 19 healthy subjects. Subregions of interest were de-fined on individual magnetic resonance images using a percentage-based operational approach. Clinical symptoms were rated by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: The [C-11]FLB457 binding potential was lower in the central medial and posterior subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. At a functional level, there was a significant negative correlation between binding potential and BPRS positive symptom scores. Conclusions: The subregions with low D-2 receptor binding comprise primarily the dorsomedial nucleus and pulvinar, two important components in circuitries previously suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission in thalamic subregions might be a mechanism underlying positive symptoms in schizophrenia.",nan; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; HUMAN BRAIN; CINGULATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREATED PATIENTS; PET; ABNORMALITIES; MEDIODORSAL

In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque. These SPP1 mRNA-positive neurons were most abundant in the primary motor area, followed by Brodmann area 5 and the supplementary motor area, in accordance with the distribution of corticospinal neurons. In addition, injection of a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer into the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) of the spinal cord caused labeling of SPP1 positive neurons, indicating the expression of SPP1 in corticospinal neurons. SPP1 was also expressed in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal ventral horn of the rhesus macaque. Although SPP1 was also detected in the brainstem and spinal cord of the marmoset and the rat, it was not detected in their cerebral cortices. Selective expression in the corticospinal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque suggests that SPP1 plays a critical role in the functional or structural specialization of highly developed corticospinal systems in certain primate species.

They are termed caudal and rostral forelimb areas (CFA and RFA). In this study, it was confirmed first that RFA and CFA are located in cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (medial and lateral parts of agranular cortex (AGm and AGI), respectively). In the second part of this study, the distribution of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to RFA and CFA was quantitatively compared by injections of small and relatively constant amounts of retrograde fluorescent dyes (diamidino yellow and fast blue) into these areas. It was observed that (1) main inputs to RFA originated from AGI, namely CFA (2) CFA received dominant inputs from AGm including RFA and caudally adjacent granular cortex and (3) wider cortical areas and larger number of neurons projected to CFA than to RFA. As for the thalamocortical projections, both RFA and CFA received inputs from various thalamic nuclei, such as VL, VM, Po, PC, PF, CL, but cells projecting to RFA and CFA were differentially located in each nucleus. It was found that labeled cell number and/or density in VM, PC, CL, CM and MD after RFA injections were significantly larger than those after CFA injections. On the other hand, labeled cell number and/or density in VPL and VL were significantly higher after CFA injections than after RFA injections. In comparison with findings in primates, the results suggest that the cortical motor areas of rats may be specialized for different aspects of motor control.

It has been dogma in sensory systems that the thalamic feedforward input is relatively weak and that there is a large amplification of the input signal by recurrent feedback. Here we show that in trichromatic primates there is a major feedforward input to layer 4C of primary visual cortex. Using a combination of 3D-electron-microscopy and 3D-confocal imaging of thalamic boutons we found that the average feedforward contribution was about 20% of the total excitatory input in the parvocellular (P) pathway, about 3 times the currently accepted values for primates. In the magnocellular (M) pathway it was around 15%, nearly twice the currently accepted values. New methods showed the total synaptic and cell densities were as much as 150% of currently accepted values. The new estimates of contributions of feedforward synaptic inputs into visual cortex call for a major revision of the design of the canonical cortical circuit.",cortical layers; NeuN; thalamic afferents; V1; VGluT2; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; OLD-WORLD; AREA 17; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

To study the development of these connections in humans, regions of fixed brain from fetuses of 20-22 gestational weeks (GW) were injected with the fluorescent tracer DiI. Placement of DiI in the optic nerve or tract labeled retinogeniculate projections. In the LGN, these projections were already segregated into eye-specific layers by 20 GW. Retinogeniculate segregation thus preceded cellular lamination of the LGN, which did not commence until 22 GW. Thalamocortical axons, labeled from DiI injections into the optic radiations, densely innervated the subplate, but did not significantly innervate the cortical plate. This pattern was consistent with observations of a waiting period in animals, when thalamocortical axons synapse in the subplate for days or weeks before entering the cortical plate. Cortical efferent neurons (labeled retrogradely from the optic radiations) were located in the subplate and deep layers of the cortical plate. In summary, human visual connections are partially formed by mid-gestation, and undergo further refinement during and after this period.

Because MD is reciprocally interconnected with prefrontal and agranular insular cortical areas, it provides a relay of ventral forebrain activity to these cortical areas. However, there are also direct projections from the piriform cortex and the amygdala to the prefrontal and agranular insular cortices. This study addresses whether this system has a triangular organization, such that structures in the ventral forebrain project to interconnected areas in MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex. The thalamocortical projections of MD have been studied in experiments with injections of retrograde tracers into prefrontal or agranular insular cortical areas. In many of the same experiments, projections from the ventral forebrain to MD and to the prefrontal/insular cortex have been demonstrated with anterograde axonal tracers. The connections of the piriform cortex (PC) with MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex form an organized triangular system. The PC projections to the central and medial segments of MD and to the lateral orbital cortex (LO) and the ventral and posterior agranular insular cortices (AI(v) and AI(p)) are topographically organized, such that more caudal parts of PC tend to project more medially in MD and more caudally within the orbital/insular cortex. The central and medial portions of MD also send matching, topographically organized projections to LO, AI(v) and AI(p), with more medial parts of MD projecting further caudally. The anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala (CO(a)) also projects to the dorsal part of the medial segment of MD and to its cortical targets, the medial orbital area (MO) and AI(p). The projections of the basal/accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei to MD and to prefrontal cortex, and from MD to amygdaloceptive parts of prefrontal cortex, are not as tightly organized. Amygdalothalamic afferents in MD are concentrated in the dorsal half of the medial segment. Cells in this part of the nucleus project to the amygdaloceptive prelimbic area (PL) and AI(p). However, other amygdaloceptive prefrontal areas are connected to parts of MD that do not receive fibers from the amygdala.

Fibers from other parts of the pallidum, or related areas such as the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, terminate in the lateral and ventral parts of MD, where they overlap with inputs from the superior colliculus and other brainstem structures.

A model of unilateral peripheral neuropathy was developed in the cynomolgus macaque, a species that is phylogenetically close to humans. Nerve entrapment was induced by placing a 4 mm length of polyvinyl cuff around the left common sciatic nerve. Prior to nerve injury, stimulation of the foot with a range of non-noxious von Frey filaments (1, 4, 8, 15, and 26 g) did not evoke brain activation as observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two weeks after injury, stimulation of the ipsilateral foot with non-noxious filaments activated the contralateral insula/secondary somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). By contrast, no activation was observed with stimulation of the contralateral foot. Robust bilateral activation of thalamus was observed three to five weeks after nerve injury. Treatment with the clinical analgesic pregabalin reduced evoked activation of Ins/SII, thalamus and ACC whereas treatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant reduced activation of the ipsilateral (left) thalamus. Twelve to 13 weeks after nerve injury, treatment with pregabalin reduced evoked activation of all regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, brain activation persisted in most ROI, except the ACC, following aprepitant treatment. Activation of the contralateral Ins/SII and bilateral thalamus was observed six months after nerve injury and pregabalin treatment suppressed activation of these nuclei. The current findings demonstrated persistent changes in CNS neurons following nerve injury as suggested by activation with non-painful mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, it was possible to functionally distinguish between a clinically efficacious analgesic drug, pregabalin, from a drug that has not demonstrated significant clinical analgesic efficacy, aprepitant.

Since tactile inputs to an opposable thumb are often spatially and temporally out of sync with inputs from the fingers, we hypothesized that inputs from the opposable thumb would be processed in an independent module in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). Here we show that in area 3b of macaque monkeys, most neurons in the thumb representation do not respond to tactile stimulation of other digits and receive few intrinsic cortical inputs from other digits. However, neurons in the representations of other 4 digits respond to touch on any of the 4 digits and interconnect significantly more. The thumb inputs are thus processed in an independent module, whereas there is a significantly more interdigital information exchange between the other digits. This cortical organization reflects behavioral use of a hand with an opposable thumb.",primate; somatotopy; intrinsic connections; area 3b; Macaca; AREA 3B; SPINAL-CORD; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; VISUAL-CORTEX; SENSORY LOSS; MOTOR AREAS; HAND USE

However, most of these models have been established on lower animals, such as rodents, and involve only a single administration of a noxious stimulus. In this study, an inflammatory soup (10 mu L), consisting of prostaglandin E2 (0.2 mM), serotonin (2 mM), bradykinin (2 mM) and histamine (2 mM), was injected into the dura mater of conscious rhesus monkeys through an indwelling catheter. The in fusion started on day 8 and was repeated every 3 days, for a total of six administrations, to induce neurogenic inflammation. We performed behavioral assessments and measured the expression of the oncogcne c-fos, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the trigeminal system and in multiple brain regions involved in pain processing by immunohistochemical staining. Compared with monkeys in the control group, three of the four animals in the inflammatory soup group displayed decreased motor behaviors, and two showed increased ipsilateral nose and mouth secretions during the stimulus period. Higher expression levels of c-fos, nNOS and CGRP were found in various brain areas of experimental animals compared with controls, including the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and other areas involved in pain perception. These results suggest that repeated inflammatory soup stimulation of the dura activates the trigeminovascular system and produces migraine-like pathological changes and abnormal behaviors in conscious rhesus monkeys.",nerve regeneration; migraine; rhesus monkey; neurogenic inflammation; cellular oncogene fos; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; calcitonin gene related peptide; trigeminal system; behavior; irnmunohistochemistry; neural regeneration; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; C-FOS; NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION; HEADACHE; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION; NUCLEUS; PAIN; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images providing a novel and accurate way of measuring very fine and local functional differences.

Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study for neuron segmentation in such large-scale anatomical regions.",macaque brain; microscopy images; neuron segmentation; segmentation evaluation; U-NET; STEREOLOGICAL ESTIMATION; NUMBERS; ARCHITECTURE; CORTEX; CELLS; SHAPE; SIZE

The nicotinic receptor agonist [C-11]MPA demonstrated rapid uptake into the brain to a similar extent as (S)(-) [C-11]nicotine and [C-11]ABT-418. When unlabeled (S)(-)nicotine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered 5 min before the radioactive tracers, the uptake of [C-11]MPA was decreased by 25% in the thalamus, 19% in the temporal cortex, and 11% in the cerebellum, whereas an increase was found for the uptake of (S)(-)[C-11]nicotine and [C-11]ABT-418.

Striatal neurone degeneration is a hallmark in Huntington's disease and we were interested in estimating total neurone and glial number in this thalamic nuclear complex. Serial 500-mu m-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal sections of the left hemisphere from six cases of Huntington's disease patients (three females, three males) and six age- and sex-matched controls were investigated applying Cavalieri's principle and the optical disector. Mean neurone number in the controls was 646,952 +/- 129,668 cells versus 291,763 +/- 60,122 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Total glial cell number (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and unclassifiable glial profiles) was higher in controls with 9,544,191 +/- 3,028,944 versus 6,961,989 +/- 2,241,543 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.021). Considerable increase of fibrous astroglia within the centromedian-parafascicular complex could be observed after Gallyas' impregnation. Most probably this cell type enhanced the numerical ratio between glial number and neurone number (glial index: Huntington's disease patients = 24.4 +/- 8.1; controls = 15.0 +/- 5.2; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.013). The neurone number in the centromedian-parafascicular complex correlated negatively, although statistically not significantly, with the striatal neurone number. This lack of correlation between an 80% neuronal loss in the striatum and a 55% neurone loss in the centromedian-parafascicular complex points to viable neuronal circuits connecting the centromedian-parafascicular complex with cortical and subcortical regions that are less affected in Huntington's disease.",Huntington's disease; human brain; thalamus; nuclei centromedianus-parafascicularis; neurone number; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; UNBIASED STEREOLOGICAL ESTIMATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; PROJECTIONS; CHOREA

Decades of experimental and modeling work in the sensory cortex have demonstrated that a perceptual decision pool is usually composed of tens to hundreds of neurons, the responses of which are significantly correlated not only with each other, but also with the behavioral choices of an animal. Few studies, however, have measured neural activity in the sensory thalamus of awake, behaving animals. Therefore, it remains unclear how many thalamic neurons are recruited and how the information from these neurons is pooled at subsequent cortical stages to form a perceptual decision. In a previous study we measured neural activity in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) contrast detection task, and found that single LGN neurons were significantly correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices, despite their relatively poor contrast sensitivity and a lack of overall interneuronal correlations. We have now computationally tested a number of specific hypotheses relating these measured LGN neural responses to the contrast detection behavior of the animals. We modeled the perceptual decisions with different numbers of neurons and using a variety of pooling/readout strategies, and found that the most successful model consisted of about 50-200 LGN neurons, with individual neurons weighted differentially according to their signal-to-noise ratios (quantified as d-primes). These results supported the hypothesis that in contrast detection the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple thalamic neurons, and that the response fluctuations in these neurons can influence contrast perception, with the more sensitive thalamic neurons likely to exert a greater influence.",lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); perception; contrast; neural model; choice probability; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL-NEURONS; AREA MT; PSYCHOPHYSICAL PERFORMANCE; INTERNEURONAL CORRELATIONS

In 23 patients the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlu) was measured with positron emission tomography and the location and spatial extent of the stroke lesions were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor impairment during the acute and chronic stages (4 weeks after stroke) was determined by a motor score and recordings of magnetic evoked motor potentials. Twelve patients recovered significantly, whereas 11 patients retained a disabling hemiparesis. In contrast to patients with good motor recovery, rCMRGlu was severely depressed in the thalamus on the lesion side in patients with poor motor recovery. This patient group also showed more severe damage to the pyramidal tract on magnetic resonance images and a more pronounced reduction of the magnetic evoked motor potential amplitude. Neither the size of the stroke lesions nor the spatial extent of the lesional and remote rCMRGlu depressions outside the thalamus correlated with the thalamic hypometabolism and the improvement of the motor score. We conclude that preservation both of parts of the pyramidal tract and of the thalamic circuitry is a major determinant for the quality of hand motor recovery following acute brain ischemia in the adult.",nan; MAGNETIC BRAIN-STIMULATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATOCAPSULAR INFARCTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FRONTAL-LOBE; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; PULVINAR; LESIONS

The results showed that areas 45A and 45B display reciprocal amygdalar connections, which appear to be considerably richer than those of their neighboring areas. Specifically, these two areas are a target of differentially weighted projections originating predominantly from the magnocellular and the intermediate subdivisions of the basal nucleus and are a source of projections mostly directed to the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus and the dorsal part of the lateral nucleus. The present data, together with previous data on the thalamic connectivity of areas 45A and 45B (Contini et al. Eur J Neurosci 32:1337-53, 2010), suggest that direct and indirect-trans-thalamic-amygdalar connectivity is a characterizing connectional feature of these two areas. Specifically, the amygdalar connections of area 45A, for which a role in communication behavior has been proposed, could convey information on the emotional significance of communicative signals to this area, where it could play a crucial role in guiding appropriate social interactions. Furthermore, the amygdalar connections of area 45B, possibly involved in higher-order aspects of visual guidance of gaze, could convey information related to the relevance of visual stimuli, which could contribute to a representation of priority maps in this VLPF area.",Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; Communication behavior; Oculomotor behavior; Primates; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MONKEY AMYGDALA; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CORTICAL INPUTS; LATERAL NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; PROJECTIONS; PATHWAYS

According to the theory conscious mechanisms are associated with behavioural diversity, whereas unconscious output is proposed to have an obligatory association with stereotypical behaviour. The respective processes are by definition a function of the type of reafferent motor input. Concepts of simple and complex premotor networks are introduced as a means of describing unconscious and conscious processes, respectively. Evidence shows that unconscious cognitive performance differs qualitatively from conscious mechanisms suggesting parallel processes. Although the postulated anatomical substrates for conscious and unconscious processes will function in this model as parallel segregated networks, it is proposed they are distributed throughout the same cortical areas of the brain. Motor reafference is postulated to be mediated via pallidal projections to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which is known to modulate thalamocortical pathways. The role of the koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus remains an enigma and has some properties in common with the well-described magnocellular and parvocellular projections. There is also much speculation about the intralaminar and midline nuclei, the so-called non-specific thalamus. The paper will examine the distinctive features of thalamocortical networks and the role of the koniocellular pathway and intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus and suggest that they form a neuroanatomical substrate for the categorizing of unconscious cognitive processes. The ILN has unique projections back to the basal ganglia, which could serve in constraining associated neocortical networks with stereotypical behaviour and thus putative unconscious processing. Only after establishing such a theoretical framework can one hope to successfully analyze the empirical literature on the syndrome of blindsight, of which a detailed account is presented. Blindsight refers to the apparent visual abilities of patients with damage to the striate visual cortex (VI). Patients will 'guess' the shape of an object or reach towards it when presented in the blind field, in spite of denying actually seeing it, i.e., they are unconsciously aware of it. Unlike the magnocellular and parvocellular geniculate pathways the koniocellular extrastriate projections partially conserve retinal information in these patients.

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer, leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN, almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast, following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN, labeled cells were found in both tiers, with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus, layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN: an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers.",VISUAL CORTEX; AREA 17; PARALLEL PATHWAYS; CORTICOTHALAMIC; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; AREA 17; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT

Upon generating a sequence, this model stores information on the serial order of components in a cortical buffer by means of theta-nested gamma frequency oscillations observed experimentally in cortico-striatal neurons. This model assumes the existence of at least two functionally different classes of striatal spiny neurons. One class of striatal projection neurons (S-cells) select the first component in the cortical buffer through a temporal winner-take-all mechanism implemented by lateral inhibition. The inhibition should last for at least a few hundred milliseconds. In reality, it may be mediated by GABAB receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cortico-striatal projection. The other class of striatal projection neurons (M-cells) retain the currently executed component in a cortico-BG-thalamic loop, for which the strong nonlinearity in transitions between up and down states of striatal neurons is crucial. For sequence generation at the level of striatum, the cortical neurons encoding the component selected for execution are inactivated by the feedback from the activated cortico-BG-thalamic loop. This model predicts that the transition to next component is triggered by a single external signal, i.e. the subthalamic input to the globus pallidum. This input gives a neural substrate for adjusting the rate of sequence generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It receives input from both the basal ganglia and cerebellum, and forms reciprocal connections with motor cortical areas. The current study examined the activity in cat VL thalamus neurons during instrumentally conditioned vocalization. Units in our sample showed irregular spontaneous firing which could be modulated by slowly occurring fluctuations in intensity of vocalization task performance. Two main types of behavioral events were associated with changes in neural firing rate. The first of these was the ingestion of food reward. More than half of all recordings showed phasic bursting patterns during licking; a similar number had increases in firing preparatory to this phasic activity. The second behavioral event modulating unit responses was vocalization. Approximately 60% of recordings showed activity changes time-locked to vocalization. These responses were almost always excitatory, and often involved changes in firing that preceded vocalization onset. No spatial organization of differences in firing pattern between neurons could be distinguished. Our results suggest that VL thalamus may well be involved in mediating vocal behavior, although its functional role remains an object of speculation.

We have now studied thalamic neuronal activity in a cerebellar relay nucleus (ventral intermediate-Vim) and a pallidal relay nucleus (ventralis oral posterior-Vop) during thalamotomy in patients with intention tremor and other clinical signs of cerebellar disease (tremor patients). The activity of single neurons and the simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity of the contralateral upper extremity in tremor patients performing a pointing task were analyzed by spectral cross-correlation analysis. EMG spectra during intention tremor often showed peaks of activity in the tremor-frequency range (1.9-5.8 Hz). There were significant differences in thalamic neuronal activity between tremor patients and controls. Neurons in Vim and Vop had significantly lower firing rates in tremor patients than in patients undergoing thalamic surgery for pain (pain controls). Other studies have shown that inputs to Vim from the cerebellum are transmitted through excitatory connections. Therefore the present results suggest that tremor in these tremor patients is associated with deafferentation of the thalamus from cerebellar efferent pathways. The thalamic X EMG cross-correlation functions were studied for cells located in Vim and Vop. Neuronal and EMG activity were as likely to be significantly correlated for cells in Vim as for those in Vop. Cells in Vim were more likely to have a phase lag relative to EMG than were cells in Vop. In monkeys, cells in the cerebellar relay nucleus of the thalamus, corresponding to Vim, are reported to lead movement during active oscillations at the wrist. In view of these monkey studies, the present results suggest that cells in Vim are deafferented and have a phase lag relative to tremor that is not found in normal active oscillations. The difference in phase of thalamic spike X EMG activity between Vim and Vop may contribute to tremor because lesions of pallidum or Vop are reported to relieve cerebellar tremor.",nan; MOTOR CORTEX; UNIT ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR GROUP; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONIAN TREMOR; MOVEMENT; MICROSTIMULATION; ORGANIZATION; LIMB; PROJECTIONS

These data were compared to the total population of LCN neurons as determined by Nissl stain. In 4 Macaca fascicularis and one Saimiri sciureus the average size of the thalamic projection from LCN was found to be 506 +/- 94 cells contralateral to the injections. Thalamically projecting LCN neurons were located between the lower medulla and the third cervical segment; approximately 90% of these cells were in the first two cervical segments. Morphologic analysis of thalamically projecting LCN cells showed that they were smaller in size, and more oblong in shape in caudal regions of the nucleus. In 3 macaques, the average total number of LCN cells was determined to be 1617 +/- 908 on one side, in Nissl material. In these Nissl-stained preparations LCN neurons were found as far caudal as the fourth cervical segment; 68% were located in the first two cervical segments. Hence, thalamically projecting LCN neurons in the monkey are located in the rostral portion of the nucleus and comprise about one-third of the total population. Comparison of these data with reports in the literature imply that, unlike the cat, the major projection from LCN in monkeys is to the mesencephalon rather than to the thalamus.",HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE; SPINAL CORD; MACACA; SAIMIRI; CELL COUNT; ASCENDING SOMATOSENSORY PROJECTIONS; PRIMATE SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; SPINOCERVICAL TRACT; SPINOMESENCEPHALIC TRACT; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; INFERIOR OLIVE; SPINAL-CORD

Using [C-11](R)PKI1195, a sensitive in vivo marker of glial cell activation, and PET, we provide first evidence that limb denervation induces a trans-synaptic increase in [C-11](R)-PKI1195 binding in the human thalamus but not somatosensory cortex: these brain structures appeared morphologically normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity. Our findings support the view that long-term rearrangement of cortical representational maps is significantly determined within the thalamus.

Normal right-handed subjects (eight men, eight women, average age=32 years) viewed four types of stimuli positioned to the right or left of the central fixation point (left hemifield-large letter, left hemitield-small letter display with flanking letters; fight hemifield-large letter, fight hemifield-small letter display with flankers). BOLD responses to small letters surrounded by flankers were compared with responses to large isolated letters. To examine maximum functional regional connectivity, we modeled subject as a random effect and attained fixed effect parameter estimates and t-statistics for functional connectivity between each of the thalamic nuclei (pulvinar, medial dorsal, and anterior) as the seed region and each non-seed voxel. Greater BOLD activation for letters surrounded by flankers than for large letters was observed in the pulvinar as anticipated and was also marked in the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN), anterior and superior cingulate (BA24 and BA24' dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontal operculum and insula. For the MDN, maximal functional connectivity was with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; correlations with left superior temporal, parietal, posterior frontal, and occipital regions were also observed.

Consequently, a hypothetical disruption of functions mediated by the pulvinar may help understand common visual and nonvisual symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. To test this hypothesis, the pulvinar nuclei of nine patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and twelve young (9-28 years of age) and age-matched controls (without dementia and with non-Alzheimer dementias) were examined using a battery of histopathological methods. All patients with Alzheimer's disease had numerous amyloid plaques and some neuritic plaques throughout the various subdivisions of the pulvinar. Neuropil threads were also present among the senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles occurred in clusters throughout the nucleus. Control patients with and without dementia had very few Alzheimer lesions, which should be expected in normal elderly individuals. The lesions in the pulvinar may help understand some of the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, including deficits in attention and in a host of visual disturbances. Such deficits may be the result of involvement of reciprocal thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits that appear to be critical for the function of a vast expanse of association cortices interconnected with the pulvinar, which are heavily laden with lesions themselves.",ALZHEIMERS DISEASE; ATTENTION; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; NEUROPIL THREADS; PULVINAR; SENILE PLAQUES; THALAMUS; MONKEY MACACA-MULATTA; INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; NEURITIC PLAQUES; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; LATERAL PULVINAR; ORGANIZATION; DEGENERATION

The human MD thalamic nucleus has been implicated in a great variety of different clinical conditions and normal functions ranging from schizophrenia, Parkinsonism and epilepsy to many cognitive functions. In the rat the MD thalamic nucleus is divided into three cytoarchitectonic sectors whereas in the primates it is divided into two; medial one-third (magnocellular) and lateral two-thirds further the lateral sector is divided into pars parvocellularis pars multiformis, pars fasciculosa and pars caudalis. In this study we used a retrograde tracer, fluoro-gold (FG) to evaluate some of the afferents reaching the lateral sector of the MD (MDl) thalamic nucleus. The results of the present study have shown that MDl receives afferent connections from the lateral cerebellar nucleus (dentate nucleus), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and zona incerta (ZI). Subsequent to FG injections into the MDl, labeled cells were observed mainly bilaterally but were sparser on the contralateral side than ipsilaterally from each of the three structures listed. All three afferents showed a topographical organization. The labeled neurons were localized at the dorsomedial aspect of the lateral cerebellar nucleus, the dorsoventral aspect of the SNR and in the dorsal sector of the ZI. The lateral cerebellar nucleus reached the MDl via the superior cerebellar peduncle. No other deep cerebellar nuclei showed labeled cells. There were no labeled cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). Although the three regions identified here are recognized as having motor functions, the connections to MD suggest that their outputs also play a role in cognitive or other higher cortical functions.",Tract tracing; retrograde; cerebellum; zona incerta; substantia nigra; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARS RETICULATA; BASAL-GANGLIA; NIGROTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN-STEM; NERVE-CELL; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS

Anat. Entwicklungsgesch. 129:53-82). The present study examined their possible contribution to the development of other thalamic nuclei. Postmortem brain tissue from human fetuses ranging between 10.5 and 40 weeks of gestation (wg) was processed by Nissl staining, Golgi impregnation, and MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) immunocytochemistry. The gangliothalamic body, suggested to serve as a conduit for cells migrating from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus, was found in the period from 15 to 34 wg in all rostrocaudal thalamic regions, particularly at the level of the anterior nuclear complex, mediodorsal and pulvinar nucleus, and in addition, the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Nissl-stained sections, the gangliothalamic body is a thin cellular layer situated beneath the thalamic surface, near the telencephalo-diencephalic junction. In Golgi- and MAP2-stained sections, it is a stream of mostly bipolar cells extending from the ganglionic eminence to the medial thalamus. In addition, MAP2-immunoreactivity confirms the neuronal nature of its cells. The present study further supports the hypothesis that certain neurons migrate from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus through the transient gangliothalamic body during fetal development. Moreover, our data indicate that both the association (mediodorsal and pulvinar), as well as the anterior (limbic) and specific relay nuclei are potential recipients of the telencephalic neurons.

The anatomy and connectivity of the primate auditory cortex has been modeled as a core region receiving direct thalamic input surrounded by a belt of secondary fields. The core contains multiple tonotopic fields (including the primary auditory cortex, AI, and the rostral field, R), but available data only partially address the degree to which those fields are functionally distinct. This report, based on single-unit recordings across four hemispheres in awake macaques, argues that the functional organization of auditory cortex is best understood in terms of temporal processing. Frequency tuning, response threshold, and strength of activation are similar between AI and R, validating their inclusion as a unified core, but the temporal properties of the fields clearly differ. Onset latencies to pure tones are longer in R (median, 33 ms) than in AI (20 ms); moreover, synchronization of spike discharges to dynamic modulations of stimulus amplitude and frequency, similar to those present in macaque and human vocalizations, suggest distinctly different windows of temporal integration in AI (20-30 ms) and R (100 ms). Incorporating data from the adjacent auditory belt reveals that the divergence of temporal properties within the core is in some cases greater than the temporal differences between core and belt.",nan; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; AMPLITUDE-MODULATED SOUNDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; FREQUENCY MODULATIONS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; ACOUSTIC FEATURES

Comparable projections have yet to be described in the primate brain, where part of the problem has been in effectively delineating these nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue from a series of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) showed that cells in the region of both the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei selectively stain for parvalbumin, thus helping to reveal these nuclei. These same tegmental nuclei were not selectively revealed when tissue was stained for SMI32, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or calretinin. In a parallel study, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the mammillary bodies of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Retrogradely labeled neurons were consistently found in the three subdivisions of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, which are located immediately below, within, and above the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Further projections to the mammillary body region arose from cells in the anterior tegmental nucleus, which appears to be a rostral continuation of the infrafascicular part of the ventral tegmental nucleus. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, labeled cells were most evident when the tracer injection was more laterally placed in the mammillary bodies, consistent with a projection to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The present study not only demonstrates that the primate mammillary bodies receive parallel inputs from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden, but also helps to confirm the extent of these poorly distinguished nuclei in the monkey brain.

This study was aimed at discovery of such a radioligand from a group of CAF(1), receptor ligands based on a core 3-(phenylamino)-pyrazin-2(1H)-one scaffold. Methods: CRF1 receptor ligands were selected for development as possible PET radioligands based on their binding potency at CRF1 receptors (displacement of [I-128]CRF from rat cortical membranes), measured lipophilicity, autoradiographic binding profile in rat and rhesus monkey brain sections, rat biodistribution, and suitability for radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Two identified candidates (BMS-721313 and BMS-732098) were labeled with fluorine-18. A third candidate (BMS-709460) was labeled with carbon-11 and all three radioligands were evaluated in PET experiments in rhesus monkey. CRF1 receptor density (B-rnax) was assessed in rhesus brain cortical and cerebellum membranes with the CRF1 receptor ligand, [H-3]BMS-728300. Results: The three ligands selected for development showed high binding affinity (IC50 values, 0.3-8 nM) at CRF1 receptors and moderate lipophilicity (LogD, 2.8-4.4). [H-3]BMS-728300 and the two F-18-labeled ligands showed region-specific binding in rat and rhesus monkey brain autoradiography, namely higher binding density in the frontal and limbic cortex, and cerebellum than in thalamus and brainstem. CRF1 receptor B-max, in rhesus brain was found to be 50-120 fmol/mg protein across cortical regions and cerebellum. PET experiments in rhesus monkey showed that the radioligands [F-18]BMS-721313, [F-18]BMS-732098 and [C-11]BMS-709460 gave acceptably high brain radioactivity uptake but no indication of the specific binding as seen in vitro. Conclusions: Candidate CRF1 receptor PET radioligands were identified but none proved to be effective for imaging monkey brain CRF1 receptors. Higher affinity radioligands are likely required for successful PET imaging of CRF1 receptors. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Thionin-stained sections in different planes showed that this is a subregion of lamina I containing clusters of neurons that appear to have pyramidal or polygonal somata. Extracellular microelectrode recordings in this region revealed clusters of thermoreceptive specific (COLD) cells with nasal or labial receptive fields, whereas nociceptive neurons were found in the adjacent portions of lamina I. Anterograde tracer injections in this region produced trigeminothalamic terminal labeling in the site homologous to the lamina I spino-thalamo-cortical relay nucleus identified previously in the Old World macaque monkey and in humans. Retrograde tracer injections involving this thalamic site, where recordings of trigeminal COLD-like neurons were obtained, produced clusters of retrogradely labeled trigeminothalamic neurons in this immunohistochemically distinct subregion of lamina I, nearly all of which are pyramidal neurons. We conclude that the nocturnal owl monkey has a specialized perinasal thermoreceptive trigeminothalamic sensory pathway that is probably of behavioral significance during olfactory sniffing. In addition, these observations corroborate other findings that have indicated that lamina I COLD cells are pyramidal neurons and are not physiologically modulated by substance P or serotonin, in contrast to nociceptive neurons.

Secondary pathways involving superior colliculus, koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar and their V1-bypassing projections to higher order cortex are known to exist. While they may form an evolutionary old visual system, their contribution to perception and visually guided behaviour remain largely obscure. Recent developments in tract tracing and circuit manipulation technologies provide new insights. Here we discuss how secondary visual pathways mediate residual vision (blindsight) after V1 injury by relaying signals directly into higher order cortical areas. We contrast these findings on blindsight with new studies on dyslexia suggesting that dysfunction of secondary visual pathways might contribute to dyslexic's perceptual difficulties. Emerging from these considerations, secondary visual pathways involving koniocellular LGN may be critical for detection of visual change, whereas pulvinar function appears more linked to visuomotor planning.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; STRIATE CORTEX; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; AREAS MT; MACAQUE; NEURONS; PROJECTION; PATHWAY; LESIONS

Herein, using a battery of complementary morphological approaches, including cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and the expression of molecular markers, we pinpoint the features or combination of features that best characterize each nucleus of the pretectothalamic transitional zone of the rat. Our results reveal useful morphological criteria to identify and delineate, with unprecedented precision, several [mostly auditory] nuclei of the posterior group of the thalamus, namely the pretectothalamic lamina (PTL; formerly known as the posterior limitans nucleus), the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGBm), the suprageniculate nucleus (SG), and the ethmoid, posterior triangular and posterior nuclei of the thalamus. The PTL is a sparsely-celled and fiber rich flattened nucleus apposed to the lateral surface of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APT) that marks the border between the pretectum and the thalamus; this structure stains selectively with the Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and is essentially immunonegative for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). The MGBm, located medial to the ventral division of the MGB (MGBv), can be unequivocally identified by the large size of many of its neurons, its dark immunostaining for PV, and its rather selective staining for WFA. The SG, which extends for a considerable caudorostral distance and deviates progressively from the MGB, is characterized by its peculiar cytoarchitecture, the paucity of myelinated fibers, and the conspicuous absence of staining for calretinin (CR); indeed, in many CR-stained sections, the SG stands out as a blank spot. Because most of these nuclei are small and show unique anatomical relationships, the information provided in this article will facilitate the interpretation of the results of experimental manipulations aimed at the auditory thalamus and improve the design of future investigations. Moreover, the previously neglected proximity between the MGBm and the caudal region of the scarcely known PTL raises the possibility that certain features or roles traditionally attributed to the MGBm may actually belong to the PTL.",auditory thalamus; posterior limitans nucleus of the thalamus; suprageniculate nucleus; medial geniculate body; anterior pretectal nucleus; ethmoid nucleus; Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA); rat; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; HAMSTER INTERGENICULATE LEAFLET; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ASCENDING PROJECTIONS; PERINEURONAL NETS; POSTERIOR GROUP; RAT-BRAIN

Most of these studies were performed with nocturnal animals, particularly mice and rats. In the current study, the PK2 and its receptor, PKR2, was cloned from a species of diurnal macaque monkey. The macaque monkey PK2 and PKR2 were found to be highly homologous to that of other mammalian species. The mRNA expression of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain was examined by in situ hybridization. The expression patterns of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain were found to be quite similar to that of the mouse brain. Particularly, PK2 mRNA was shown to oscillate in the SCN of the macaque brain in the same phase and with similar amplitude with that of nocturnal mouse brain. PKR2 expression was also detected in known primary SCN targets, including the midline thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. In addition, we detected the expression of PKR2 mRNA in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) of both macaque and mouse brains. As a likely SCN to dorsal raphe projection has previously been indicated, the expression of PKR2 in the raphe nuclei of both macaque and mouse brain signifies a possible role of DR as a previously unrecognized primary SCN projection target.",Prokineticin 2; G protein-coupled receptor; circadian clock; suprachiasmatic nucleus; monkey; diurnal; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; SEROTONIN RELEASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; DIURNAL RODENT; RAT; NEURONS; RHYTHMS; OUTPUT

Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus.

SUMMARY ANSWER Behavioral, pharmacological and in vivo brain imaging findings indicate that pain can be quantified in macaques with endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is characterized by abdominopelvic hypersensitity. The mechanism by which endometriosis evokes pain is largely unknown, as currently available analgesics offer limited pain relief. Thus, there is a need for both greater understanding of the in vivo mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain and better methods of testing novel therapeutics. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Pain-related behavior and brain activation were assessed in five cynomolgus macaques with endometriosis. Three healthy female macaques served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Abdominopelvic sensitivity to force was assessed with an algometer. Activation of brain areas using block design force stimulation and the effects of a single dose of the analgesic drug morphine and 2-month treatment with the progestin dienogest on brain activation were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Pain response thresholds in macaques with endometriosis were significantly less than that of healthy macaques (P = 0.0003). In addition, non-noxious force activated the insula and thalamus, which was reduced with morphine and 2-month dienogest treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The specific role of cysts, such as peritoneal cysts, in endometriosis pain was not explored. While non-noxious stimulation activated the insula and thalamus, macaques were sedated during fMRI scans. Current findings need further confirmation in a larger cohort. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current study demonstrated central sensitization and related pain behavior in macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis. Altered functioning of the central nervous system could be the focus of future mechanistic studies and for the development of novel therapeutics.

To answer this question, we first located flexible and stable value-coding areas in the caudate head (CDh) and caudate tail (CDt) of two rhesus macaque monkeys, and then injected different retrograde tracers into these areas of each monkey. We found that CDh and CDt received different inputs from several cortical and subcortical areas including temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, claustrum and thalamus. Superior temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex projected to both CDh and CDt, with more CDt-projecting than CDh-projecting neurons. In superior temporal cortex and dorsal inferior temporal cortex, layers 3 and 5 projected to CDh while layers 3 and 6 projected to CDt. Prefrontal and cingulate cortex projected mostly to CDh bilaterally, less to CDt unilaterally. A cluster of neurons in the basolateral amygdala projected to CDt. Rostral-dorsal claustrum projected to CDh while caudal-ventral claustrum projected to CDt. Within the thalamus, different nuclei projected to either CDh or CDt. The medial centromedian nucleus and lateral parafascicular nucleus projected to CDt while the medial parafascicular nucleus projected to CDh. The inferior pulvinar and lateral dorsal nuclei projected to CDt. The ventral anterior and medial dorsal nuclei projected to CDh. We found little evidence of neurons projecting to both CDh and CDt across the brain. These data suggest that CDh and CDt can control separate functions using anatomically separate circuits. Understanding the roles of these striatal projections will be important for understanding how value memories are created and stored.",basal ganglia; caudate; neural pathways; object value learning; rhesus monkey; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUITS; LAYER VI NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; NEUROFILAMENT PROTEIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE

In guinea pigs, although alternating bilateral jaw movements are usually seen during natural chewing, it is still unclear which cortical areas are responsible for chewing-like RJM. To address this issue, we first defined the cortical areas inducing chewing-like RJM by intracortical microstimulation. Stimulation of the most lateral area of the CMA, the granular cortex, induced chewing-like RJM, but from the region medial to this area, simple vertical RJM were induced. Subsequently, to reveal the properties of these two areas in the CMA, the connections between the CMA and the dorsal thalamus were examined by neuronal tract-tracing techniques. The area inducing chewing-like RJM possessed strong reciprocal connections, mainly with the medial part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, which is the sensory-relay thalamus. On the other hand, the simple vertical RJM-inducing area had reciprocal connections with the motor thalamus. The present study suggests that the CMA inducing chewing-like RJM is different from the CMA inducing simple vertical RJM, and plays a role in cortically induced chewing-like RIM under the influence of the sensory thalamus in guinea pigs.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig, 2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function. Together with the preceding observations of selective STT projections to other thalamic regions, these results provide compelling evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.",sensorimotor; somatosensory; integration; cerebellothalamic; motor; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; II MUSCLE AFFERENTS; ROSTRAL BRAIN-STEM; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MOTOR CORTEX; SPINAL-CORD; THALAMIC NUCLEI; LAMINA-I; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; REFLEX PATHWAYS

This unique connectivity suggests that the TRN plays a pivotal role in regulating information flow through the thalamus. Here, we analyzed the roles of TRN neurons in visually guided reaching movements. We first used retrograde transneuronal labeling with rabies virus, and showed that the rostro-dorsal sector of the TRN (TRNrd) projected disynaptically to the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). In other experiments, we recorded neurons from the TRNrd or PMv while monkeys performed a visuomotor task. We found that neurons in the TRNrd and PMv showed visual-, set-, and movement-related activity modulation. These results indicate that the TRNrd, as well as the PMv, is involved in the reception of visual signals and in the preparation and execution of reaching movements. The fraction of neurons that were non-selective for the location of visual signals or the direction of reaching movements was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. Furthermore, the fraction of neurons whose activity increased from the baseline was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. The timing of activity modulation of visualrelated and movement-related neurons was similar in TRNrd and PMv neurons. Overall, our data suggest that TRNrd neurons provide motor thalamic nuclei with inhibitory inputs that are predominantly devoid of spatial selectivity, and that these signals modulate how these nuclei engage in both sensory processing and motor output during visually guided reaching behavior.",action; nonhuman primates; premotor cortex; reaching movement; visuomotor control; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; 3 MOTOR AREAS; POSTERIOR MEDIAL THALAMUS; MULTISYNAPTIC PROJECTIONS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SENSORY SELECTION

To understand the neural mechanism of this transformation process, we examined whether or not the information represented in individual MD neuron's activity changes during a trial of the task. Two monkeys performed two oculomotor delayed-response tasks (an ordinary and a rotatory oculomotor delayed-response task). As MD neurons show directional delay-period activity, we compared the directional selectivity of the same MD neuron between these two tasks and determined whether the activity represented the cue direction or the saccade direction. Among the 26 MD neurons that showed directional delay-period activity, representing information of 27% of neurons gradually altered from the visual domain to the oculomotor domain, while the remaining neurons kept holding either the visual or the oculomotor information throughout the delay period. These results indicate that gradual alteration of information representing in individual MD neurons during the delay period plays an important role in spatial working-memory performance. This alteration could be performed by interactions among MD neurons representing different information during the delay period.",delay-period activity; information transformation; monkey; spatial working memory; thalamic mediodorsal nucleus; POPULATION VECTOR ANALYSIS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; NUCLEUS; LOBE; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; EFFERENTS

The ligand has high affinity for alpha(4)beta(2) nAChRs (K-D=50pM), crosses the blood-brain barrier, and distributes in the monkey brain in a pattern consistent with that of alpha(4)beta(2) nAChRs. The specific/non-specific binding ratio increased steadily, reaching a value of 3.3 in the thalamus at 4 h. The specific binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 Was reversed by cytisine.

This study aimed to further explore white matter abnormalities in OCD patients through diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and tractography of the two white matter tracts which most probably play an important role in OCD neuropathology: the anterior segment of cingulum bundles (ACB) and the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). Twelve right-handed, medicated adult patients with OCD and 12 matched controls underwent DSI on a 3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Tractography based on DSI data was reconstructed to define the ACB and ATR. Mean generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) was calculated for each targeted tract and was used to analyze local changes in microstructural integrity along individual tracts. There was a significantly lower mean GFA in both the right ATR and left ACB in OCD subjects compared to controls. OCD subjects also demonstrated decreased left-lateralized asymmetry of the ACB when compared to controls. Furthermore, the mean GFA of the left ACB positively correlated with OCD subjects' obsessive subscores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale. This study supports the white matter abnormalities in the ACB and ATR of OCD subjects, which corroborates neurobiological models that posit a defect in fronto-striato-thalamic circuitry in OCD.

Specific HRP pressure injections to the rostral RNT(1.6-1.8 mm caudal to bregma) resulted in retrograde labelling of neurones in the cerebellar nuclei. The rostral RNT showed specific topographical organization of its cerebellar connections. Microinjections into the rostral RNT, 1.6 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the anterior interposed (emboliform nucleus) and scarce HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei, whereas injections into the rostral RNT, 1.8 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the posterior interposed (globose nucleus) and scarce lightly HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar connections with the rostral RNT were exclusively ipsilateral to the injection site. No HRP-labelled cells were detected in the medial (fastigial nucleus) cerebellar nucleus. The cerebellar connections reach the RNT via the superior cerebellar peduncle. By contrast, HRP injections into the anterior, posterior interposed and lateral cerebellar nuclei produced no labelled cells within the RNT. This study demonstrates the existence of direct cerebello-RNT but not RNT-cerebellar connections.

Dense global subnetworks of these pathways have often been studied, primarily due to their functional implications. Instead we study sparse local subnetworks of the pathways to establish the role of a brain area in enabling shortest path communication between its non-adjacent topological neighbours. We propose a novel metric to measure the topological communication load on a vertex due to its immediate neighbourhood, and show that in terms of distribution of this local communication load, a network of Macaque long distance pathways is substantially different from other real world networks and random graph models. Macaque network contains the entire range of local subnetworks, from star-like networks to clique-like networks, while other networks tend to contain a relatively small range of subnetworks. Further, sparse local subnetworks in the Macaque network are not only found across topographical super-areas, e.g., lobes, but also within a super-area, arguing that there is conservation of even relatively short-distance pathways. To establish the communication role of a vertex we borrow the concept of brokerage from social science, and present the different types of brokerage roles that brain areas play, highlighting that not only the thalamus, but also cingulate gyrus and insula often act as relays for areas in the neocortex.

In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones.

Thalamic neurons that receive synaptic input from the globus pallidus or the cerebellar nuclei were identified in awake monkeys trained to perform an arm-reaching task. The location of electrophysiologically identified cerebellar-receiving (CR) and pallidal-receiving (PR) neurons was used to identify a total of 264 thalamic neurons in cerebellar (CB) or pallidal (GP) regions of the thalamus. 2. Stimulation in the brachium conjunctivum or white matter adjacent to the cerebellar nuclei excited 85 neurons in the thalamus at short latencies. These CR neurons were located in the oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), in caudal portions of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), and in area X. 3. Stimulation in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) inhibited 10 thalamic neurons at short latency. These PR neurons were located in rostral portions of VLc, in the oral part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo), and in the parvicellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). 4. There was no clear single somatotopic organization of neurons in CB and GP regions of the thalamus, as defined by free-form responses to passive manipulation and observation of eye movements. There was, in fact, a tendency for two representations, each, of the head/eye/mouth cells and cells with modifications of activity in response to manipulation of the arm. 5. During the hold period before illumination of a visual target, the mean firing rates and variability of discharge of arm-related CR and PR neurons did not differ significantly. This was also true for the total sample of arm-related neurons in the CB versus GP regions. 6. The activity of many neurons in both the CB and GP regions began to change before the reaching movement and, for some, before the earliest recorded changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity. The initial change was an increase in discharge for > 75% of the cells studied in both the CB and GP regions. 7. During the reaching task, there also was no significant difference in the time of the initial change in discharge of neurons in the CB versus GP regions of the thalamus. 8. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial task-related change in discharge of PR thalamic neurons is dominated by input from the cerebral cortex and that pallidal input modulates later phases of their movement-related changes in activity.",nan; GOAL-DIRECTED MOVEMENT; SINGLE CELL DISCHARGE; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; BASAL GANGLIA; ARM MOVEMENTS

Accordingly, we used in vitro slices from which to record and labeled cells in the middle layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices to compare basic anatomical and physiological features of cells recovered in similar layers using the same methods. Our results demonstrate a striking difference in a basic characteristic of two primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual cortex, spiny stellate cells predominate, receive short-latency synaptic inputs, and project to supergranular layers. No such spiny stellate population is encountered in the middle layers of the auditory cortex. Spiny cells that are not stellate or pyramidal are occasionally encountered but, as a group, do not display consistent anatomical or physiological features that might allow them to function as auditory cortical versions of the visual spiny stellates.

To probe the function of CG feedback in a causal manner, we selectively and reversibly manipulated the activity of CG neurons in anesthetized ferrets in vivo using a combined viral-infection and optogenetics approach to drive expression of channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in CG neurons. We observed significant increases in temporal precision and spatial resolution of LGN neuronal responses to drifting grating and white noise stimuli when CG neurons expressing ChR2 were light activated. Enhancing CG feedback reduced visually evoked response latencies, increased spike-timing precision, and reduced classical receptive field size. Increased precision among LGN neurons led to increased spike-timing precision among granular layer V1 neurons as well. Together, our findings suggest that the function of CG feedback is to control the timing and precision of thalamic responses to incoming visual signals.",corticothalamic; LGN; V1; feedback; optogenetics; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; CORTICAL FEEDBACK; STRIATE CORTEX; RABIES VIRUS; GAIN-CONTROL; LAYER 6; THALAMUS

In three experiments using blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural substrates of acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in which certain sounds can produce an intense somatosensory tingling sensation in a patient with a thalamic lesion. Compared with nine normal controls, the first experiment showed that the patient had a threefold greater BOLD response to sounds in the parietal operculum, the location of secondary somatosensory cortex. We hypothesized that this abnormal opercular activity might be the neural substrate of the patient's synesthesia. Supporting this hypothesis, the second experiment demonstrated that sounds that produced no somatosensation did not evoke a BOLD response in the operculum, while sounds that produced strong somatosensations evoked large BOLD responses. These abnormal responses may have resulted from plasticity induced by the loss of somatosensory inputs. Consistent with this idea, in the third experiment, BOLD responses to somatosensory stimulation were significantly weaker in the patient's operculum than in normal controls. These experiments demonstrate a double dissociation in the patient's secondary somatosensory cortex (increased responses to auditory stimulation and decreased responses to somatosensory stimulation), and suggest both that stroke-induced plasticity can result in abnormal connections between sensory modalities that are normally separate, and that synesthesia can be caused by inappropriate connections between nearby cortical territories.",somatosensory; multisensory integration; auditory; tactile; thalamus; stroke; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; AUDITORY ASSOCIATION CORTEX; HUMAN SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; HUMAN BRAIN; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; MACAQUE MONKEY; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION

Angiotensin IV binds to a high affinity site that is quite distinct in pharmacology and distribution from the angiotensin II AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and is known as the AT(4) receptor. These observations suggest that the AT(4) receptor may have multiple central effects. The present study uses in vitro receptor autoradiography, and employs [I-125]angiotensin IV to map AT(4) receptors in the macaca fascicularis brain. The distribution of the AT(4) receptor is remarkable in that its distribution extends throughout several neural systems. Most striking is its localization in motor nuclei and motor associated regions. These include the ventral horn spinal motor neurons, all cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor, abducens, facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Receptors are also present in the vestibular, reticular and inferior olivary nuclei, the granular layer of the cerebellum, and the Betz cells of the motor cortex. Moderate AT(4) receptor density is seen in all cerebellar nuclei, ventral thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta, with lower receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Abundant AT(4) receptors are also found in areas associated with cholinergic nuclei and their projections, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus, somatic motor nuclei and autonomic preganglionic motor nuclei. AT(4) receptors are also observed in sensory regions, with moderate levels in spinal trigeminal, gracile, cuneate and thalamic ventral posterior nuclei, and the somatosensory cortex. The abundance of the AT(4) receptor in motor and cholinergic neurons, and to a lesser extent, in sensory neurons, suggests multiple roles for the AT(4) receptor in the primate brain.",motor neuron; sensory neuron; cholinergic neuron; cognition; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ANGIOTENSIN-IV; BINDING-SITE; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT-BRAIN; CORTEX; CELLS

Damage to the medial, magnocellular part of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impairs cognitive functions dependent on prefrontal cortex, including memory. The contribution of MDmc to other aspects of cognition dependent on prefrontal cortex has not been determined. The ability of monkeys to adjust their choice behavior in response to changes in reinforcer value, a capacity impaired by lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, can be tested in a reinforcer devaluation paradigm. In the present study, rhesus monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic MDmc lesions were tested in the devaluation procedure. Monkeys learned visual discrimination problems in which each rewarded object is reliably paired with one of two different food rewards and then were given choices between pairs of rewarded objects, one associated with each food. Selective satiation of one of the food rewards reduces choices of objects associated with that food in normal monkeys. Monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of MDmc learned concurrently presented visual discrimination problems as quickly as unoperated control monkeys but showed impaired reinforcer devaluation effects. This finding suggests that the neural circuitry for control of behavioral choice by changes in reinforcer value includes MDmc.",amygdala; choice behavior; decision-making; devaluation; medial thalamus; orbitofrontal cortex; prefrontal cortex; reward; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FRONTAL-LOBE; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; DOUBLE DISSOCIATION; KORSAKOFF PATIENTS; MEMORY; PROJECTIONS

To investigate the development of a major afferent input to the cortex, we studied the formation of thalamocortical connections in an organotypic culture system. Slices from the lateral thalamus of young rats were cocultured with slices from the visual cortex. Thalamocortical projections in vitro were examined anatomically with fluorescent dyes and physiologically with electrophysiological and optical recording techniques. Axons emerged from thalamic explants radially in all directions. The outgrowth of thalamic fibers and the course of the axonal trajectories were not influenced by the presence of the cocultured cortex. Only those thalamic axons that happened to grow toward the cortical slices invaded their target tissue. Thalamocortical projection cell in vitro had the characteristic morphology of thalamic relay neurons. Cells with the morphology of interneurons were present in thalamic explants, but these neurons did not project to the cocultured cortex. Thalamocortical axons in vitro terminated in their appropriate cortical target layer, formed axonal arbors, and made functional synaptic contacts. Such specific connections between thalamic neurons and their cortical target cells were established regardless of whether thalamocortical axons invaded the cortex from the white matter side or from the pial surface. These results suggest that thalamic projection neurons have an innate mechanism that allows them to recognize their cortical target cells. Thus, intrinsic factors play a significant role in the laminar specification of cortical connections during development.",nan; EARLY POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; IDENTIFIED PROJECTION NEURONS; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; WHITE MATTER; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY

This work assesses the in vivo binding and imaging characteristics of [F-18]nifene in rhesus monkeys for the development of PET experiments examining nAChR binding. Methods: Dynamic PET imaging experiments with [F-18]nifene were acquired in four anesthetized Macaca mulatta (rhesus) monkeys using a microPET P4 scanner. Data acquisition was initiated with a bolus injection of 109 +/- 17 MBq [F-18] nifene and the time course of the radioligand in the brain was measured for up to 120 min. For two experiments, a displacement dose of (-)nicotine (0.03 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was given 45-60 min post injection and followed 30 min later with a second [F-18]nifene injection to measure radioligand nondisplaceable uptake. Time activity curves were extracted in the regions of the antereoventral thalamus (AVT), lateral geniculate nucleus region (LGN), frontal cortex, and the cerebellum (CB). Results: The highest levels of [F-18]nifene uptake were observed in the AVT and LGN. Target-to-CB ratios reached maximum values of 3.3 +/- 0.4 in the AVT and 3.2 +/- 0.3 in the LGN 30-45 min postinjection. Significant binding of [F-18]nifene was observed in the subiculum, insula cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain areas. The (-)nicotine displaced bound [F-18]nifene to near background levels within 15 min postdrug injection. No discernable displacement was observed in the CB, suggesting its potential as a reference region. Logan graphical estimates using the CB as a reference region yielded binding potentials of 1.6 +/- 0.2 in the AVT and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in the LGN. The postnicotine injection displayed uniform nondisplaceable uptake of [F-18]nifene throughout gray and white brain matter. Conclusions: [F-18]Nifene exhibits rapid equilibration and a moderately high target to background binding profile in the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR rich regions of the brain, thus providing favorable imaging characteristics as a PET radiotracer for nAChR assay.

The present study addressed this question from the point of view of connectional properties by comparing the afferent and efferent projections of the caudal forelimb area (CFA), considered to be the equivalent of the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (MI), and a second forelimb motor representation, the rostral forelimb area (RFA). As a result of various tracing experiments (including double labeling), it was observed that CFA and RFA had reciprocal corticocortical connections characterized by preferential, asymmetrical, laminar distribution, indicating that RFA may occupy a different hierarchical level than CFA, according to criteria previously discussed in the visual cortex of primates. Furthermore, it was found that RFA, but not CFA, exhibited dense reciprocal connections with the insular cortex. With respect to their efferent projection to the basal ganglia, it was observed that CFA projected very densely to the lateral portion of the ipsilateral caudate putamen, whereas the contralateral projection was sparse and more restricted. The ipsilateral projection originating from RFA was slightly less dense than that from CFA, but it covered a larger portion of the caudate putamen (in the medial direction); the contralateral projection from RFA to the caudate putamen was of the same density and extent as the ipsilateral projection. The reciprocal thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of RFA and CFA differed from each other in the sense that CFA was mainly interconnected with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, while RFA was mainly connected with the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. Altogether, these connectional differences, compared with the pattern of organization of the motor cortical areas in primates, suggest that RFA in the rat may well be an equivalent of the premotor or supplementary motor area. In contrast to the corticocortical, corticostriatal, and thalamocortical connections, RFA and CFA showed similar efferent projections to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, tectum, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, and spinal cord.",MOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; THALAMUS; TRACING; DOUBLE LABELING; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS LEUKOAGGLUTININ; BIOCYTIN; WGA-HRP; CHOLERA TOXIN; RAT; LEUKOAGGLUTININ PHA-L; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS

The visual system of macaque has been extensively characterized both anatomically and functionally. We have taken advantage of this to examine the influence of congenital blindness in a macaque model of developmental anophthalmia. Developmental anophthalmia in macaque effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Here we show that retrograde tracers injected in early visual areas, including HC, reveal a drastic reduction of cortical projections of the reduced lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, there is an important expansion of projections from the pulvinar complex to the HC, compared to the controls. These findings show that the functional consequences of congenital blindness need to be considered in terms of both modifications of the interareal cortical network and the ascending visual pathways.",connectivity; deafferentation; hybrid cortex; primate; pulvinar; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; BILATERAL ENUCLEATION; CORTICAL AREAS; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY; PULVINAR; MONKEY; SPECIFICATION

Some degree of pathway specificity in the utilization of synaptic zinc has been reported in rodents. Here, we use focal injections of the retrograde tracer sodium selenite to identify zinc-positive (Zn+) projection neurons in the monkey ventral visual pathway. After injections in V1, V4, and TEO areas, neurons were detected preferentially in several feedback pathways but, unusually, were restricted to deeper layers without involvement of layers 2 or 3. Temporal injections resulted in more extensive labeling of both feedback and intratemporal association pathways. The Zn+ neurons had a broader laminar distribution, similar to results from standard retrograde tracers. After anterograde tracer injection in area posterior TE, electron microscopic analysis substantiated that a proportion of feedback synapses was colabeled with zinc. Nearby injections, Zn+ intrinsic neurons concentrated in layer 2, but in temporal areas were also abundant in layer 6. These results indicate considerable pathway and laminar specificity as to which cortical neurons use synaptic zinc. Given the hypothesized roles of synaptic zinc, this is likely to result in distinct synaptic properties, possibly including differential synaptic plasticity within or across projections.",feedback; feedforward; subpopulations of pyramidal neurons; ventral visual pathway; zinc; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL NETWORKS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; ZINCERGIC NEURONS; BARREL CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL SYNAPSES; DIFFERENTIAL CONNECTIONS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS

The present experiments use both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques to characterize the connections of Rgb. The main cortical projections from Rgb are to the caudal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, area 18b, retrosplenial granular a cortex (Rga), and postsubiculum, and less dense terminal fields are present in the prelimbic and caudal occipital cortices. The major subcortical projections are to the anterior thalamic nuclei and the rostral pontine nuclei, and very small terminal fields are present in the caudal dorsomedial part of the striatum, the reuniens and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, and the mammillary bodies. Contralaterally, Rgb primarily projects to itself, i.e., hornotypically, and more sparsely projects to Rga and postsubiculum. In general, the axons from Rgb terminate ipsilaterally in cortical layers I and III-V and contralaterally in layer V, with a smaller number of terminals in layers I and VI. Thalamic projections from Rgb target the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, with only a few axons terminating in the anterodorsal nucleus, the reticular nucleus, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. Rgb is innervated by the anterior cingulate cortex, precentral agranular cortex, cortical area 18b, dorsal subiculum, and postsubiculum. Subcortical projections to Rgb originate mainly in the claustrum, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These data demonstrate that, in the rat, Rgb is a major nodal point for the integration and subsequent distribution of information to and from the hippocampal formation, the midline limbic and visual cortices, and the thalamus. Thus, similarly to the entorhinal cortex, Rgb in the rat is a prominent gateway for information exchange between the hippocampal formation and other limbic areas of the brain.",anterior thalamic nuclei; cingulate cortex; hippocampus; limbic system; Papez circuit; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; CINGULATE CORTICAL-LESIONS; HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPISODIC MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; LATERODORSAL NUCLEUS

Following tritiated amino acid injections into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and WGA-HRP injections into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei, we found that the nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic afferents distribute to three main targets: the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the internal medullary lamina (IML) region, which includes the paralaminar VA, the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the central lateral nucleus (CL), and finally the ventromedial nucleus (VM). We observed three distribution patterns of labeled fibers: a) Dense single label was observed in the central portion of VA following the SNr injections and in VL following the cerebellar nuclei injections. b) A complementary pattern consisting of alternating foci of nigral and cerebellar label was found in the IML region. This pattern was also observed in the caudal intralaminar nuclei where cerebellar label predominated in the centrum medianum (CM), while the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) primarily contained nigral label. c) An overlapping pattern of autoradiographic and WGA-HRP label was found in the lateral half of the VM. Overall, the distribution of nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections was widespread throughout much of rostrocaudal thalamus. However, the pattern of projections varied along a continuum from lateral to medial thalamus. In lateral thalamus, nigral and cerebellar projections distributed to separate nuclei while in medial thalamus, the projection pattern changed to focal and complementary in the IML and overlapping in VM. Taken together, these thalamic projections may constitute crucial links in different functional channels involved in alerting and orienting mechanisms associated with motor behavior. Our findings also suggest that the organization of motor thalamic afferents in the dog shares similarities with the segregated and parallel circuitry characteristic of primates as well as with the overlapping and converging circuits of rodents and other carnivores.",AUTORADIOGRAPHY; CEREBELLUM; MOTOR THALAMUS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; VENTROMEDIAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; ROSTRAL BRAIN-STEM; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; CEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; MACACA-MULATTA; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS

Previous PET S1R radiotracers are characterized by slow kinetics or off-target binding that impedes their use in humans. Here, we report the first PET imaging evaluation in rhesus monkeys of 4 F-18-labeled spirocyclic piperidine-based PET radiotracers (F-18-1 to F-18-4). Methods: Baseline scans for the 4 radiotracers were obtained on an adult male rhesus monkey. Blocking scans were obtained with the S1R-selective agonist SA4503 to assess binding specificity of F-18-2 and F-18-4. Arterial input functions were measured, and binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis. Results: In the rhesus brain, all 4 radiotracers showed high and fast uptake. Tissue activity washout was rapid for F-18-2 and F-18-4, and much slower for F-18-1 and F-18-3, in line with their respective in vitro S1R-binding affinities. Both the 1-tissue-compartment and multilinear analysis-1 kinetic models provided good fits of time-activity curves and reliable estimates of distribution volume. Regional distribution volume values were highest in the cingulate cortex and lowest in the thalamus for all radiotracers. F-18-4 showed greater differential uptake across brain regions and 3-fold-higher binding potential than F-18-2. SA4503 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg blocked approximately 85% (F-18-2) and 95% (F-18-4) of radiotracer binding. Conclusion: Tracers F-18-2 and F-18-4 displayed high brain uptake and fast tissue kinetics, with F-18-4 having higher specific binding signals than F-18-2 in the same monkey. Taken together, these data indicate that both F-18-2 and F-18-4 possess the requisite kinetic and imaging properties as viable PET tracers for imaging S1R in the human brain.",sigma-1 receptor; PET; radioligand; F-18; rhesus monkey; RECEPTOR LIGANDS; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; BRAIN; TOMOGRAPHY; NEUROSTEROIDS; DERIVATIVES; SA4503; MICE

In each of these three domains the rodent model exhibits striking similarities to humans. We hypothesize that there is a specific thalamo-cortical-basal ganglia network that subserves spatial attentional functions. Key components of this network are medial agranular and posterior parietal cortex, dorsocentral striatum, and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus. Several issues need to be addressed before we can hope to realistically understand or model the functions of this networks Among these are the roles of medial versus lateral posterior parietal cortex; cholinergic mechanisms in attention; interhemispheric interactions; the role of synchronous firing at the cortical, striatal, and thalamic levels; interactions between cortical and thalamic projections to the striatum; interactions between cortical and nigral inputs to the thalamus; the role of collicular inputs to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; the role of cerebral cortex versus superior colliculus in driving the motor output expressed as orienting behavior during directed attention; the extent to which the circuitry we describe for directed attention also plays a role in other forms of attention.

According to their model, core auditory cortex receives predominantly unimodal sensory input from the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGBv); whereas belt cortex receives predominantly cross-modal sensory input from nuclei outside the MGBv. We previously characterized distinct response properties in rat primary (A1) versus ventral auditory field (VAF) cortex; however, it has been unclear whether VAF should be categorized as a core or belt auditory cortex. The current study employed high-resolution functional imaging to map intrinsic metabolic responses to tones and to guide retrograde tracer injections into A1 and VAF. The size and density of retrogradely labeled somas in the medial geniculate body (MGB) were examined as a function of their position along the caudal-to-rostral axis, subdivision of origin, and cortical projection target. A1 and VAF projecting neurons were found in the same subdivisions of the MGB but in rostral and caudal parts, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells projected to both regions. VAF projecting neurons were smaller than A1 projecting neurons located in dorsal (MGBd) and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei. Thus, soma size varied with both caudal-rostral position and cortical target. Finally, the majority (>70%) of A1 and VAF projecting neurons were located in MGBv.

In addition, portions of the sensory nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc) were explored. Isolated neurons were examined for their responses to somatosensory examination and active movement (n = 919) and for their response to torque-induced joint displacements ( n = 375). A total of 684 neurons was determined histologically to lie within specific subnuclei of the motor (n = 574) or sensory (n = 110) thalamus. The sensorimotor response properties of neurons in the thalamic subnuclei showed clear differences in their response to somatosensory examination. In order of decreasing frequency, the percent of neurons responding to passive somatosensory examination in each subnucleus were as follows: VPLc, 96% (106/110), VPLo, 93% (252/270), VLc, 77% (43/56), VLo, 37% (59/155), Area X, 22%( 12/53), and VA, 12% (5/40). Conversely, neurons that responded only to active movement were most frequent in VLo, 44% (68/155), VA, 45% (18/40), and Area X, 40% (21/53) and relatively infrequent in VLc 11% (6/56) and VPLo, 3% (7/270). In VPLc, no neurons were found that responded only to active movement (0/110). A well-defined somatotopic organization was found in VLo, VPLo, and VPLc and was suggested strongly for VLc. Individual body regions were represented in a series of lamellae, organized in a partial onion skin-like arrangement with the leg represented in the outermost lamella, and the trunk, arm, and orofacial regions represented in successively deeper lamellae. In general the body representations, although present for each subnucleus thoroughly examined, i.e., VLo, VPLo, and VPLc, also were contiguous across subnuclei. Based on the available data, a clear somatotopic picture could not be discerned for Area X or VA. Responses to torque application were more common in neurons in VPLo (77%; 60/78) and VLc (73%; 16/22) than in VLo (44%; 12/27). Mean latencies were shortest for neurons in VPLo (25 +/- 14 ms; mean +/- SD) and the bordering (shell) region of VPLc (22 +/- 15 ms) and were approximately twice as long in VLc (51 +/- 23 ms) and VLo (47 +/- 21 ms). Short-latency (<20 ms) responses to torque application were found for a large proportion of cells in VPLo (45%; 27/60). These neurons were located largely in the lateral portions of ventro-caudal VPLo. The presence of short-latency torque responses in this portion of VPLo suggests that this region may act as a direct relay for proprioceptive information from the periphery to the motor cortex because this area of VPLo has been demonstrated to project directly to the motor cortex. Although mean firing frequencies for VPLo (22 +/- 11 Hz) were different from other subnuclei within the motor thalamus (12 +/- 8, 13 +/- 8, 15 +/- 8, and 12 +/- 8 Hz for VLc, VLo, VA, and Area X, respectively), there was a wide distribution of average rates with significant overlap between subnuclei. Mean firing frequencies in VPLc (26 +/- 8 Hz) were similar to those in VPLo. This study is the first physiological study to demonstrate a detailed somatotopy in both basal ganglia (VLo) and cerebellar (VPLo and VLc) receiving areas of the thalamus and to identify and localize neurons with short-latency responses to kinesthetic stimuli in the posterolateral portions of VPLo.",nan; VENTRALIS INTERMEDIUS NEURONS; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LATENCY PERIPHERAL INPUTS; DORSAL COLUMN INPUT; MACACA-MULATTA; CAT THALAMUS; SINGLE CELL; VL NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS

Preferred directions are influenced by visual cues as well as idiothetic self-motion cues derived from vestibular, proprioceptive, motor efferent copy, and command signals. To distinguish the relative importance of active locomotor signals, we compared HD cell response properties in 49 anterodorsal thalamic HD cells of six male Long-Evans rats during active displacements in a foraging task as well as during passive rotations. Since thalamic HD cells typically stop firing if the animals are tightly restrained, the rats were trained to remain immobile while drinking water distributed at intervals from a small reservoir at the center of a rotatable platform. The platform was rotated in a clockwise/counterclockwise oscillation to record directional responses in the stationary animals while the surrounding environmental cues remained stable. The peak rate of directional firing decreased by 27% on average during passive rotations (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). Individual cells recorded in sequential sessions (n = 8) reliably showed comparable reductions in peak firing, but simultaneously recorded cells did not necessarily produce identical responses. All of the HD cells maintained the same preferred directions during passive rotations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of locomotor activity provides a state-dependent modulation of the response magnitude of AD HD cells. This could result from diffusely projecting neuromodulatory systems associated with motor state.",nan; WHOLE-BODY ROTATIONS; FREELY MOVING RATS; ANTERIOR THALAMUS; NUCLEUS; NEURONS; POSTSUBICULUM; CORTEX; CUES; PROJECTIONS; DEPENDENCE

Cat areas 17, 18, and 19 can be equated with macaque areas V1, V2, and V3, respectively, based on criteria of relative position in the cortical mantle, internal organization of visual field representations, and trans- and subcortical connections. Using these same criteria, a visual area on the medial bank of the lateral suprasylvian sulcus (area PMLS) in the cat can be equated with macaque area V5. The equivalences are supported by data on neuronal receptive field properties and the contributions the areas make to visual behavior. Although the data are scanty for most other visual areas, there are enough data tentatively to equate collectively cat areas 20a and 20b with macaque areas TF and TH and to liken cat areas 21a and 21b with macaque area V4. What is not clear is if there is a region in cat that is equivalent to area TE in the macaque monkey. If there is, it likely lies on the banks of the posterior suprasylvian sulcus between areas 20 and 21 and the polysensory cortex of the posterior ectosylvian gyrus. Knowledge gained from prior research on macaque areas V4 and TE can be used to formulate specific additional investigations of cat area 21 and the uncharted posterior suprasylvian sulcus. In addition, prior investigations carried out on cat area 20 can be used to devise specific explorations of macaque areas TF and TH.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN AREA; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; SINGLE-CELL PROPERTIES; ADJACENT THALAMIC NUCLEI; REVERSIBLE COLD LESIONS; STRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY

Inflammatory changes in brain could underlie this injury. Here, we evaluated whether neuroinflammation is induced by chorioamnionitis in a clinically relevant model. Methods: Rhesus macaque fetuses were exposed to either intra-amniotic (IA) saline, or IA lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg) 16 or 48 h prior to delivery at 130 days (85 % of gestation) (n = 4-5 animals/group). We measured cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), froze samples from the left brain for molecular analysis, and immersion fixed the right brain hemisphere for immunohistology. We analyzed the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, CCL2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2 in the periventricular white matter (PVWM), cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum by RT-qPCR. Brain injury was assessed by immunohistology for myelin basic protein (MBP), IBA1 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte marker), NeuN (neuronal marker), CD3 (T cells), and CD14 (monocytes). Microglial proliferation was assessed by co-immunostaining for IBA1 and Ki67. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. Results: IA LPS increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PVWM, thalamus, and cerebellum, increased IL-6 concentration in the CSF, and increased apoptosis in the periventricular area after 16 h. Microglial proliferation in the white matter was increased 48 h after IA LPS. Conclusions: LPS-induced chorioamnionitis caused neuroinflammation, microglial proliferation, and periventricular apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of chorioamnionitis in fetal rhesus macaques. These findings identify specific responses in the fetal brain and support the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory changes may mediate the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with chorioamnionitis.",Chorioamnionitis; Prematurity; Brain injury; Periventricular leukomalacia; Cytokines; Microglia; Apoptosis; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA; BRAIN-INJURY; HISTOLOGICAL CHORIOAMNIONITIS; PREMATURE-INFANT; GESTATIONAL-AGE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; GRAY-MATTER; INFECTION; BIRTH

We determined regional brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex) immune and virological profiles at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) with SIVmac239 in rhesus macaques. The basal ganglia and thalamus had detectable viruses earlier (7 dpi) than the frontal cortex (14 dpi) and contained higher quantities of viruses than the latter. Increased immune activation of astrocytes and significant infiltration of macrophages in the thalamus at 14 dpi coincided with elevated plasma viral load, and SIV colocalized only within macrophages. RNA signatures of proinflammatory responses, including IL-6, were detected at 7 dpi in microglia and interestingly, preceded reliable detection of virus in tissues and were maintained in the chronically infected macaques. Countering the proinflammatory response, the antiinflammatory response was not detected until increased TGF-beta expression was found in perivascular macrophages at 14 dpi. But this response was not detected in chronic infection. Our data provide evidence that the interplay of acute proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses in the brain likely contributed to the overt neuroinflammation, where the immune activation preceded reliable viral detection.",nan; SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CD8(+) T-CELLS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MOLECULAR CLONES; HIV; PHOSPHORYLATION; SIVMAC239; RESERVOIR; GENES

Using in situ hybridization, we examine the distribution pattern of both GAD mRNAs in the hypothalamus and thalamus of prepubertal and adult male rhesus macaques. Qualitatively, GAD(65) and GAD(67) mRNAs showed a similar wide, but highly specific distribution pattern, supporting the view that GABAergic neurons play an important role in modulating neuroendocrine function. However, no quantitative difference in the intensity of hybridization signal was detected between prepubertal and adult animals in any of the hypothalamic or thalamic nuclei. Therefore, although GABAergic neurons are anatomically well-placed to control the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in primates, it is unlikely that the onset of puberty and the associated increase in GnRH secretion is triggered by a change in GAD gene transcription.

The usual CA-CP system did not appear satisfactory for stereotaxy of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus. Variation studies on ventriculograms and reconstructions from histological material were done to find more reliable systems. The most precise system of coordinates for cartography and stereotaxy of the amygdala is based on the 'amygdalar notch', a ventricular diverticulum forming the angle between the inferior and anterior borders of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, located beneath the inferior border of the amygdala. The AN point, the vertex of the notch in the sagittal direction, is a reliable ventricular landmark in the antero-posterior and infero-superior directions. The medial vertex of the diverticulum, ANm, is a ventricular landmark in the medio-lateral direction. The 'AN system of coordinates' is a reliable system for amygdalar stereotaxy. Stereotaxy of the anterior hippocampus would benefit from other ventricular landmarks. The most lateral point of the main body (HiL) is a landmark for the medio-lateral dimension. Ventriculography and ventricular landmarks should always be used for stereotaxy in primate species.

The lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP) may also play a role in directed attention and neglect because LP has robust reciprocal connections with these cortical areas and projects to DCS. We used anterograde axonal tracing to map thalamostriatal projections from LP and surrounding thalamic nuclei, with a focus on projections to DCS. The thalamic nuclei investigated included LP, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus (LD), central lateral nucleus (CL), and posterior thalamic nucleus (Po). We found that the mediorostral part of LP (LPMR) projects strongly to DCS as well as to the dorsal peripheral region of the striatum. Further, there is topography within LPMR and DCS such that the far medial LPMR projects to the central region of DCS (projection area of AGm) and the central LPMR projects to the dorsal region of DCS (projection area of PPC and Oc2M). In contrast, the laterorostral part of LP (LPLR) and other thalamic nuclei surrounding LP project to dorsolateral to dorsomedial peripheral regions of the striatum but do not project to DCS. These findings indicate that DCS is a region of convergence for thalamostriatal and corticostriatal projections from regions that are themselves interconnected, serving as the key element of the corticostriatal-thalamic network mediating spatial processing and directed attention.

As expected, all of the neurons in the visual sector were immunoreactive for GAD, the synthesizing enzyme for GABA, but the distribution of SOM-immunoreactive cells was not uniform. It appeared that every cell in the medial tier was immunoreactive for SOM, but that very few cells in the lateral tier contained this neuropeptide.

However, it is unknown whether, and how, these structures are engaged during the observation of actions performed by effectors different from the hand. To address this issue, in the present fMRI study, healthy human participants were required to execute or to observe grasping acts performed with different effectors, namely mouth, hand, and foot. As control, participants executed and observed simple movements performed with the same effectors. The results show that: (1) execution of goal-directed actions elicited somatotopically organized activations not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus; (2) action observation evoked cortical, cerebellar and subcortical activations, lacking a clear somatotopic organization; (3) in the territories displaying shared activations between execution and observation, a rough somatotopy could be revealed in both cortical, cerebellar and subcortical structures. The present study confirms previous findings that action observation, beyond the cerebral cortex, also activates specific sectors of cerebellum and subcortical structures and it shows, for the first time, that these latter are engaged not only during hand actions observation but also during the observation of mouth and foot actions. We suggest that each of the activated structures processes specific aspects of the observed action, such as performing internal simulation (cerebellum) or recruiting/inhibiting the overt execution of the observed action (basal ganglia and sensory-motor thalamus).",Action observation; Mirror neuron system; Somatotopy; fMRI; cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FMRI EVIDENCE; PARIETAL; REPRESENTATION; NEURONS; PREMOTOR; MACAQUE; PERCEPTION; MOVEMENT

One possible underlying pathophysiology is serotonergic dysfunction. In this study, we used an animal model of HIV, the SIV-infected macaque, to longitudinally image serotonin transporter (SERT) expression before and after inoculation, using 11C-DASB (SERT ligand) PET imaging. Methods: We infected seven rhesus macaques with a neurovirulent SIV strain and imaged them at baseline and multiple time points after inoculation (group A). Pyrosequencing methylation analysis of the SERT promoter region was performed. We also measured SERT mRNA/protein in brain single-cell suspensions from another group (group B) of SIV-infected animals (n = 13). Results: Despite some animals showing early fluctuations, 86% of our group A animals eventually showed a net increase in midbrain/thalamus binding potential (BPND) over the course of their disease (mean increased binding between last time point and baseline = 30.2% and 32.2%, respectively). Repeated-measures mixed-model analysis showed infection duration to be predictive of midbrain BPND (p = 0.039). Thalamic BPND was statistically significantly associated with multiple CSF cytokines (P < 0.05). There was higher SERT protein levels in the second group (group B) of SIV-infected animals with SIV encephalitis (SIVE) compared to those without SIVE (p = 0.014). There were no longitudinal changes in SERT gene promoter region percentage methylation between baselines and last time points in group A animals. Conclusion: Upregulated SERT leading to lower synaptic levels of serotonin is a possible mechanism of depression in HIV+ patients, and extrapolating our conclusions from SIV to HIV should be sought using translational human studies.",HIV; SIV; depression; serotonin transporter; PET; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DNA METHYLATION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BINDING DOMAIN; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; VIRUS; GENE

The purpose of this work was to explore the cortical and subcortical mechanisms underlying the execution of voluntary saccadic eye movements in humans. 2. Normalized regional cerebral blood flow (NrCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and (H2O)-O-15 bolus intravenous injections in four right-handed healthy volunteers at rest and while performing self-paced voluntary horizontal saccadic eye movements in total darkness. 3. Magnetic resonance imaging of each subject's brain was matched to PET images, allowing the detection of activation in individually defined anatomic regions of interest. Cortical regions were drawn according to gyri limits; subcortical structures were also defined. 4. Self-paced saccadic eye movements elicited bilateral NrCBF increases in the lenticular nuclei, including putamen and globus pallidus, and in the thalamus. At the cortical level, we found bilateral NrCBF increases in the precentral gyrus, the superior part of the median frontal gyrus that corresponds to the supplementary motor area. There was also a significant NrCBF increase in the cerebellar vermis. 5. Right fusiform and lingual gyri, right insula, and left cingulate gyrus were also activated during the execution of saccades. 6.

Compared with previous studies, we observed a more widespread distribution of Met-8 in the human diencephalon. Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers exhibited a more widespread distribution in the hypothalamus than in the thalamus. We observed six populations of Met-8immunoreactive cell bodies. These perikarya were observed in the paratenial thalamic nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, pallidohypothalamic nucleus and in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part). In the thalamus, Met-8-immunoreactive fibers were primarily observed in the midline region, whereas in the hypothalamus, these fibers were widely distributed. In general, a moderate/low density of Met-8-immunoreactive fibers was observed in the diencephalic nuclei. A moderate density was observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, reuniens thalamic nucleus, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The present study is the first to demonstrate the presence of clusters of Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies in the human thalamus and hypothalamus, the distribution of fibers containing neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and the presence of these fibers in several thalamic nuclei. This neuroanatomical study will serve to elucidate the physiological roles of Met -8 in future studies of the human diencephalon. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main thalamic projections, which originated in both the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, were topographically organized. Our results suggest the existence of a third, caudal subdivision of this nucleus, which is likely to be homologous to the macaque's pars densocellularis. A substantial, but not topographically organized, projection to Brodmann's area 10 originated in the medial part of the ventral anterior nucleus. Minor thalamic projections originated in the medial pulvinar nucleus and in the midline/intralaminar nuclei. Finally, the posterior thalamic group (including the limitans and suprageniculate nuclei) sent a small projection to rostral area 10 that has not previously been documented in primates. The main extrathalamic projections stemmed from the claustrum, which contained as many as 50% of all subcortical labelled neurons. Minor connections originated in the hypothalamus (mainly in the lateral anterior and lateral tuberal regions), dorsal periaqueductal grey matter, basal forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert and horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca), and amygdala (basal, accessory basal and lateral nuclei). The present results, combined with recent data on the cortical projections to area 10, reveal the frontal pole as a region that integrates information from multiple neural processing systems, including high-level sensory, limbic and working memory-related structures. Although the pattern of subcortical projections is similar to that previously described in the macaque, suggesting a homologous organization, the present data also suggest functional distinctions between medial and lateral sectors of area 10.",claustrum; cognition; connectivity; limbic; prefrontal cortex; primate; thalamus; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MIDBRAIN PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; COMMON MARMOSET

Neurons were counted in this same nucleus, allowing the magnification functions (cells/degree(2) as functions of eccentricity) of magnocellular and parvocellular layers to be determined after eliminating the effects of nonuniform volume shrinkage. Parvocellular magnification was approximately 10,000 times higher in the foveola than in the far periphery. On average, magnocellular neurons made up 2.6% of the LGN in the central 2 degrees (but probably a smaller fraction in the central fovea). The magnocellular portion increased steadily with eccentricity to 27% in the far periphery. Thus the magno/parvo ratio increases from foveola to far periphery by a factor of at least 14. The parvocellular magnification function matches estimates of cortical magnification, whereas the density of magnocellular afferents to cortex increases monotonically with eccentricity. At the posterior pole of the nucleus, the numbers of layers are reduced through a fusion of two layers and the disappearance of one or two others, a feature that may be associated with the foveal ipsilateral hemifield representation.

Behavioural investigation of the effects of these disconnections gives information that cannot be derived either from clinical studies or from the effects of bilateral symmetrical ablations in the monkey. Disconnection experiments are particularly suited to the study of the interactions between the components of widespread cortical networks. We propose that memory acquisition is dependent on plastic cortical changes that are widespread, rather than limited to the medial temporal lobe. Further, memory acquisition depends on cortical-subcortical interactions to a greater extent than memory retrieval does. Prefrontal cortex, we suggest, is specifically important in the representation of temporally complex events. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson Srl.

In particular, modulatory control of processing in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, V1, and V2 will alter the outcome of all subsequent processing of visual information, including the extent to and manner in which individual inputs contribute to perception and decision making and are stored in memory. This review addresses five small-molecule neuromodulators-acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, no-radrenaline, and histamine-considering the structural basis for their action, and the effects of their release, in the early visual pathway of the macaque monkey. Traditionally, neuromodulators are studied in isolation and in discrete circuits; this review makes a case for considering the joint action of modulatory molecules and differences in modulatory effects across brain areas as a better means of understanding the diverse roles that these molecules serve.",cholinergic; dopaminergic; histaminergic; noradrenergic; norepinephrine; serotonergic; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LOCUS-COERULEUS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SEROTONERGIC PROJECTIONS; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CORTICAL STATE; GUINEA-PIG; NEW-WORLD; INNERVATION

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques.",Acetylcholine; Nicotinic receptor; Muscarinic receptor; Behavioral flexibility; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION; TRANSIENT INACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS

Peak dose dyskinesia is a major problem in the treatment of parkinsonian patients with levodopa therapy but this remains the best pharmacological agent for treating the condition. The hypothesis was derived from previous work which has suggested that reduced pallidal inhibition of the thalamus results in dyskinesia [Crossman (1990) Movement Dis. 5, 100-108]. A neuroanatomical tracing study was carried out prior to the thalamotomy work, using the anterograde tracer wheatgerm-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. This delineated the anterior part of the ventrolateral thalamus in the primate in terms of its afferent inputs. Wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the medial segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three Macaca fascicularis and traced to terminals in the ventral thalamus and other brain areas. The appropriate thalamic area involved was plotted on atlas sections in preparation for stereotactic thalamotomy. Previous studies of neuronal input to the ventral thalamus are confusing due to the different nomenclatures used by different workers. Early workers used cytoarchitectonic boundaries which do not correspond with function. There are also differences in nomenclature between man, monkey and other animals. The current study maps the pallidal terminal territory within the thalamus in terms of stereotactic co-ordinates related to a published macaque atlas [Shantha et al. (1968) A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Java Monkey Brain. S. Karger, Basel] and can thus be used by other workers in the field. A well-established primate model of Parkinsonism was used for the thalamotomy study. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak-dose dyskinesia which was scored in terms of its choreic and dystonic components. A radiofrequency electrode was used to create the ablative lesions. Chorea was always reduced and frequently abolished by a thalamotomy located in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies in a total of six animals. Four animals received bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations and two animals underwent unilateral surgery. Lesions which were positioned medial to the pallidal terminal territory (n = 3) had no permanent effect upon chorea. Lesions were also made in the thalamic areas which receive cerebellar and nigral inputs and in other areas which receive input from the medial segment of the globus pallidus, including the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the pedunculopontine nucleus. None of these lesions had a significant effect upon peak-dose chorea. In contrast to the dramatic effects upon chorea, peak-dose dystonia was not affected by any of the thalamic lesions. The data suggest that: (i) levodopa-induced chorea can be alleviated by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory of the thalamus and (ii) chorea and dystonia are mediated by different pathophysiological circuits.",nan; LATERAL THALAMIC REGION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; PARS COMPACTA; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONS; PROJECTIONS; RAT; HRP; MECHANISMS; RETROGRADE

On the basis of a systematic series of tritiated amino acid injections into different portions of the substantia nigra, we found that the rostral three-fourths of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) gives rise to widespread thalamic projections. The nigrothalamic label occupied a longitudinal band extending from rostral ventral anterior nucleus (VA) through to caudal mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In the dog, VA is histochemically identified as an acetylthiocholinesterase (AChE)-negative region and is distinct from the adjacent ventral lateral nuclei which stain positively for AChE. In rostral thalamus, the dense autoradiographic label was observed in rostral VA within the AchE-negative region lying alongside the mammillothalamic tract (MT). The adjacent AChE-positive ventral lateral nuclei did not contain autoradiographic label. In addition, homogeneously distributed silver grains were observed throughout the ventromedial nucleus (VM) bilaterally. More caudally, as the ventral lateral thalamic compartment emerges, label was also observed within the internal medullary lamina region, including the paralaminar portion of VA, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the paralaminar portion of MD. Finally, in caudal thalamus, the central portion of MD, as well as the parafascicular nucleus (Pf), contained autoradiographic label. The overall nigrothalamic distribution observed in the dog was similar to the distribution of nigrothalamic projections in monkeys with one exception. Unlike that of primates, the distribution of nigral efferents is to the whole extent of VM in the dog as in other non-primate species. Overall, we found that nigral efferents primarily project to three main thalamic targets: the VA/MD region, VM, and the internal medullary lamina region, which includes dorsal CL and paralaminar VA and MD. We propose that these three nigrothalamic territories may constitute critical links subserving different functional channels.","AUTORADIOGRAPHY; THALAMUS, SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; VENTROMEDIAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT"

The present study was undertaken in the context of surgical treatment of motor disorders such as essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to precisely determine the course and three-dimensional stereotactic localisation of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts in the human brain. The course of the fibre tracts to the thalamus was traced in the subthalamic region using multiple staining procedures and their entrance into the thalamus determined according to our atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia [Morel (2007) Stereotactic atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia. Informa Healthcare Inc., New York]. Stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates were determined by sectioning thalamic and basal ganglia blocks parallel to stereotactic planes and, in two cases, by correlation with magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the same brains prior to sectioning. The major contributions of this study are to provide: (1) evidence that the bulks of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts are clearly separated up to their thalamic entrance, (2) stereotactic maps of the two tracts in the subthalamic region, (3) the possibility to discriminate between different subthalamic fibre tracts on the basis of immunohistochemical stainings, (4) correlations of histologically identified fibre tracts with high-resolution MRI, and (5) evaluation of the interindividual variability of the fibre systems in the subthalamic region. This study should provide an important basis for accurate stereotactic neurosurgical targeting of the subthalamic region in motor disorders such as PD and ET.",basal ganglia; thalamus; motor disorders; essential tremor; Parkinson's disease; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; MICROELECTRODE-GUIDED PALLIDOTOMY; INTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

In the contralateral hemisphere injections of the same tracer involving the full cortical depth were made in homotopical locations, and the distribution and soma size of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons in each side of the thalamus were compared. It was found that, in the cat, labeled neurons in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex, and in paralaminar regions of the ventrolateral complex, were fewer in number and smaller in size in cases of superficial deposits than in cases of deep injection. In more lateral portions of the ventrolateral complex, however, there were no size differences. In the monkey, similar differences in number and size appeared in the caudal division of the ventrolateral complex and in the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, whereas no such differences were found for neurons labeled in the oral and medial divisions of the ventrolateral complex, and in the ventral posteroinferior nucleus. In all cases the intralaminar and midline nuclei exhibited retrogradely labeled neurons only when deep layers were injected. These and previous findings point to the existence of a widely distributed layer I-projecting system of neurons which, in most nuclei, are interspersed among neurons projecting mainly to middle or deep layers. In some nuclei, however, as is the case with the ventromedial nucleus proper, layer I-projecting system neurons would make up the whole nucleus. The cell groups located in a paralaminar position, which would be but a part of this system, could provide through their projections to layer I in the posterior parietal and frontal cortical regions a final path for recruiting responses and spontaneous spindling activities.",nan; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The study includes descriptions of some of the major cortical influences on sensory and motor circuits subserving vision, hearing and proprioception, as well as movements of the eyes, head and limbs. It also describes the detailed anatomy of the red nucleus in the monkey, and highlights species differences in this structure. It also postulates that cortical projections to the parvicellular component of the red nucleus provide a recurrent loop returning via the thalamus to the motor cortex. The findings reported in this paper helped to substantiate Kuypers' new theory on the organisation of the descending motor pathways by showing that the primary motor cortex, as well as providing a direct crossed corticospinal input to spinal circuits controlling movements of the distal extremities (hand and foot), also influenced these same circuits through ipsilateral projections to the cells of origin of the rubrospinal tract. In contrast, projections from more rostra] motor, premotor and prefrontal regions terminated bilaterally in the parvicellular red nucleus, and influenced ventromedial descending pathways controlling movements of the head, neck, trunk and proximal limbs. The paper has proved of lasting value to our understanding of sensorimotor control and the contribution of different pathways to it.

Rats were given saline or muscimol infusions into the MATN contralateral to the trained eye before each of four conditioning sessions with an auditory CS. Rats were then given four additional sessions without infusions to assess savings from the initial training. All rats were then given a retention test with a muscimol infusion followed by a recovery session. Muscimol infusions through cannula placements within 0.5 mm of the MGm prevented acquisition of eyeblink conditioned responses (CRs) and also blocked CR retention. Cannula placements more than 0.5 mm from the MATN did not completely block CR acquisition and had a partial effect on CR retention. The primary and secondary effects of MATN inactivation were examined with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Differences in 2-DG uptake in the auditory thalamus were consistent with the cannula placements and behavioral results. Differences in 2-DG uptake were found between groups in the ipsilateral auditory cortex, basilar pontine nuclei, and inferior colliculus. Results from this experiment indicate that the MATN contralateral to the trained eye and its projection to the pontine nuclei are necessary for acquisition and retention of eyeblink CRs to an auditory CS.",nan; NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; RABBITS ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PLASTICITY; LATERAL RETICULAR NUCLEUS; GENICULATE-BODY; PONTINE NUCLEI; INTERPOSITUS NUCLEUS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The thalamic input to these two subregions was studied and quantified to gain more information about the influence of the cerebellum and basal ganglia on the oculomotor control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex. A recent study using transneuronal transport of virus demonstrated that there are neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellum that project to the FEFsac with only a single intervening synapse (Lynch et al., 1994). In the present study, we concentrated on the thalamic input to the FEFsem to define possible basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex and cerebellum-thalamus-cortex channels of information flow to the FEFsem. We localized the functional subregions using low threshold microstimulation, and retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were then placed into the FEFsem and FEFsac. The neurons that project to the FEFsem are distributed in (1) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (2) the caudal portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (3) the mediodorsal nucleus, (4) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars parvocellularis, and (5) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars magnocellularis. In contrast, the large majority of neurons that project to the FEFsac are located in the paralaminar region of the mediodorsal nucleus. The FEFsac and FEFsem thus each receive neural input from both basal ganglia-receiving and cerebellar-receiving cell groups in the thalamus, but each receives input from a unique combination of thalamic nuclei.",pursuit eye movements; saccades; basal ganglia; substantia nigra; cerebellum; frontal eye field; supplementary eye field; thalamus; Cebus monkeys; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; LOCAL DOPAMINE DEPLETION; RHESUS-MONKEY; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; OCULOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; MACACA-MULATTA

To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas.",nan; VENTRAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SELF-MOTION; HEADING PERCEPTION; NERVE AFFERENTS; UTRICULAR AFFERENTS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES

Here we describe the organization of the somatosensory system in a 6-year-old monkey (Macaca radiata) born with a deformed left foot in comparison to the results from a normal monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Toes 1, 3, and 5 were missing, but the proximal parts of toes 2 and 4 were present. We used anatomical tracers to characterize the patterns of peripheral input to the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as between thalamus and cortex. We also determined the somatotopic organization of primary somatosensory area 3b of both hemispheres using multiunit electrophysiological recording. Tracers were subcutaneously injected into matching locations of each foot to reveal their representations within the lumbar spinal cord, and the gracile nucleus (GrN) of the brainstem. Tracers injected into the representations of the toes and plantar pads of cortical area 3b labeled neurons in the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Contrary to the orderly arrangement of the foot representation throughout the lemniscal pathway in the normal monkey, the plantar representation of the deformed foot was significantly expanded and intruded into the expected representations of toes in the spinal cord, GrN, VPL, and area 3b. We also observed abnormal representation of the intact foot in the ipsilateral spinal cord and contralateral area 3b.

A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or neurobiotin. J Neurosci Meth 1996;65:113-36], which allows us to functionally characterize and subsequently label single neurons in vivo in macaque VI. The method is generally applicable in acute in vivo preparations. Extracellular recording is made with a patch electrode when the electrode is attached to the cell membrane. Initially a 'blind' search method is used as a guide to obtaining a cell attached configuration that we refer to as a loose-patch (LP). The neuron's receptive field properties are functionally characterized, the neuron is labeled and then characterization is confirmed, all in the LP configuration. There are a number of advantages of the method that we describe over other methods. First, we have found that we can obtain stable extracellular recordings for periods of hours that enable us to make a relatively comprehensive visual functional characterization of a neuron's receptive field properties. Second, because the electrode is closely apposed to the cell we obtain excellent isolation of the extracellular spike. Third, the method provides labeling that gives complete dendritic and axonal filling that survives over a number of days, which is an important feature in acute primate experiments. Fourth, the in vivo method of labeling and reconstructing neurons gives complete three-dimensional structure of the neuron including its intra-cortical axonal arbor. These features overcome known limits of the established methods of studying neuronal morphology including the Golgi stain (limited when adult tissue is used) and in vitro whole cell methods (incomplete axonal filling due to limited slice thickness). They also overcome the known limits of the established method of combined function-morphology studies i.e. intracellular recording in vivo. The modified juxtacellular method provides a reliable alternative to the difficult method of characterization by extracellular recording and subsequent intracellular labeling [Anderson JC, Martin KAC, Whitteridge D. Form, function and intracortical projections of neurons in the striate cortex of the monkey Macacus nemestrinus. Cerebral Cortex 1993;3:412-20]. We show the method can be used to record at a range of depths through V 1 cortex allowing for sampling of neurons in the different layers and functional subpopulations. Links can then be made with existing knowledge about the anatomical organization of V I, the various morphological classes of neurons found therein, their functional connectivity and visual response properties.

The responses of neurons in this area are not critically dependent on inputs from the primary visual cortex (VC), as lesions of VC leave neuronal response properties in PMLS relatively unchanged (Spear & Baumann, 1979; Spear, 1988; Guido et al., 1990b). However, previous studies have used a limited range of visual stimuli. In this study, we assessed whether neurons in PMLS cortex remained direction-selective to complex motion stimuli following a lesion of VC, particularly to complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Unilateral aspiration of VC was performed on post-natal days 7-9. Single unit extracellular recordings were performed one year later in the ipsilateral PMLS cortex. As in previous studies, a reduction in the percentage of direction selective neurons was observed with drifting sinewave gratings. We report a previously unobserved phenomenon with sinewave gratings, in which there is a greater modulation of firing rate at the temporal frequency of the stimulus in animals with a lesion of VC, suggesting an increased segregation of ON and OFF sub-regions. A significant portion of neurons in PMLS cortex were direction selective to simple (16/18) and complex (11/16) RDKs. However, the strength of direction selectivity to both stimuli was reduced as compared to normals. The data suggest that complex motion processing is still present, albeit reduced, in PMLS cortex despite the removal of VC input. The complex RDK motion selectivity is consistent with both geniculo-cortical and extra-geniculate thalamo-cortical pathways in residual direction encoding.",electrophysiology; neuronal reorganization; thalamo-cortical loops; cortico-cortical connectivity; plasticity; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; NEW-WORLD MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL COMPENSATION

In this study, we examined the extent and anatomical organization of cerebellar input to multiple regions of prefrontal cortex. We first used conventional retrograde tracers to map the origin of thalamic projections to five prefrontal regions: medial area 9 (9m), lateral area 9 (9l), dorsal area 46 (46d), ventral area 46, and lateral area 12. Only areas 46d, 9m, and 9l received substantial input from thalamic regions included within the zone of termination of cerebellar efferents. This suggested that these cortical areas were the target of cerebellar output. We tested this possibility using retrograde transneuronal transport of the McIntyre-B strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 from areas of prefrontal cortex. Neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport of virus were found in the dentate nucleus only after injections into areas 46d, 9m, and 9l. The precise location of labeled neurons in the dentate varied with the prefrontal area injected. In addition, the dentate neurons labeled after virus injections into prefrontal areas were located in regions spatially separate from those labeled after virus injections into motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Our observations indicate that the cerebellum influences several areas of prefrontal cortex via the thalamus. Furthermore, separate output channels exist in the dentate to influence motor and cognitive operations. These results provide an anatomical substrate for the cerebellum to be involved in cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, and rule-based learning.",prefrontal cortex; cerebellum; thalamus; dentate nucleus; transneuronal transport; herpes simplex virus; primate; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; FRONTAL ASSOCIATION CORTEX; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY

However, little is known about the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the auditory system of macaque monkeys. In this study, we examined the overall distribution of cell bodies that expressed mRNAs for VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 (markers for glutamatergic neurons), GAD67 (a marker for GABAergic neurons), and GLYT2 (a marker for glycinergic neurons) in the auditory system of the Japanese macaque. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GAD67 in order to compare the distribution of proteins and mRNAs. We found that most of the excitatory neurons in the auditory brainstem expressed VGLUT2. In contrast, the expression of VGLUT1 mRNA was restricted to the auditory cortex (AC), periolivary nuclei, and cochlear nuclei (CN). The co-expression of GAD67 and GLYT2 mRNAs was common in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), CN, and superior olivary complex except for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which expressed GLYT2 alone. In contrast, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and AC expressed GAD67 alone. The absence of co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the medial geniculate, medial superior olive, and VNLL suggests that synaptic responses in the target neurons of these nuclei may be different between rodents and macaque monkeys.

From 8-13 g.w. mainly CaBP was expressed in the cells while fiber bundles traversing the thalamus in addition to CaBP expressed all GABA markers except GAD67. CaBP and PARV expression patterns in different nuclei changed over the time course studied, whereas NT was expressed consistently along the anterior-lateral curvature of the thalamus. CalR and SMI were detectable at 23 g.w. in the ventral parts of the dorsal thalamus. Most remarkably, punctate GAD65 immunoreactivity in the neuropil was confined to the nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent receiving nuclei from 16 to about 21 g.w., overlapping with that of CaBP in some of these nuclei (subdivisions of the ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei) and with PARV in others (centromedian nucleus). During this period, GAD65 immunoreactivity can be considered a marker of the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory in the motor thalamus. GAD67-positive local circuit neurons were first detected at 12-13 g.w. in the thalamic nuclei outside the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory. In the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei, GAD-containing local circuit neurons were not conspicuous even at 22-23 g.w. The cells of the reticular nucleus expressed GAD67 and PARV from 12 g.w. on starting in the lateral-posterior regions. By 23 g.w., both markers were expressed in about two-thirds of the nucleus except for its most medial-anterior part. The results imply spatially and temporally differential expression of GABA and differentiation markers in the developing human thalamus.

We test the hypothesis that SIV-infection produces proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI)-observed decline in the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and elevations in the glial marker, myo-inositol (mI), and associated creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) in these structures.Design:Pre- and 4-6 weeks post-SIV infection (with CD8(+) T-lymphocyte depletion) was monitored with T-2-weighted quantitative MRI and 16x16x4 multivoxel H-1-MRSI (TE/TR=33/1400ms) in the brains of five rhesus macaques.Methods:Exploiting the high-resolution H-1-MRSI grid, we obtained absolute, cerebrospinal fluid partial volume-corrected NAA, Cr, Cho and mI concentrations from centrum semiovale, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus regions.Results:Pre- to post-infection mean Cr increased in the thalamus: 7.20.4 to 8.0 +/- 0.8mmol/l (+11%, P<0.05); mI increased in the centrum semiovale: 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 0.8mmol/l, caudate: 5.7 +/- 0.7 to 7.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l, thalamus: 6.8 +/- 0.8 to 8.5 +/- 0.8mmol/l and hippocampus: 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.4mmol/l (+29%, +27%, +24% and +29%, all P<0.05). NAA and Cho changes were not significant.Conclusion:SIV-infection appears to cause brain injury indirectly, through glial activation, while the deep gray matter structures' neuronal cell bodies are relatively spared. Treatment regimens to reduce gliosis may, therefore, prevent neuronal damage and its associated neurocognitive impairment.

Next to reviewing the role of beta oscillations in human beat perception, here we discuss the role of primate putaminal oscillatory activity in the control of rhythmic movements that are guided by a sensory metronome or internally gated. The analysis of the local field potentials of the behaving macaques showed that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing of the metronome, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, during internally driven rhythmic tapping. Thus, this review emphasizes the need of parametric neurophysiological observations in non-human primates that display a well-controlled behavior during high-level cognitive processes.",Interval timing; Basal ganglia; Putamen; Beta oscillations; Neural encoding; Rhesus macaques; MEDIAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS OSCILLATIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; BEAT PERCEPTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY

They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an amygdalectomy in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after each operation. Disconnection of the amygdala from the ventral striatum was without effect on learning rate. An earlier study had shown that disconnection of the amygdala from either the mediodorsal thalamus or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produced only a mild impairment, significantly less severe than that produced by bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. The present results show, however, that disconnection of the amygdala from both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the same animal, by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and of both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the other hemisphere, produces an impairment as severe as that which follows bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. These results show that, in stimulus - reward associative memory, the role of the amygdala is entirely dependent on its interaction with the frontal lobe, either by direct projections or by indirect subcortical pathways including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus; and that there are at least two partially independent pathways by which the amygdala can influence the frontal lobe.",CYNOMOLGUS; MACAQUE; VISUAL LEARNING; VENTRAL STRIATUM; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS; MONKEYS; CORTEX; DISCONNECTION; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; NUCLEUS

Collinear flankers can enhance or decrease the perceptual and neuronal sensitivity to flanked stimuli. These effects are mediated through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), in conjunction with feedback from higher visual areas. The strength of lateral interactions is affected by cholinergic neuromodulation. Blockade of muscarinic receptors should increase the strength of lateral intracortical interactions, while nicotinic blockade should reduce thalamocortical feed-forward drive. Here we test this proposal through local iontophoretic application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, while recording single cells in parafoveal representations in awake fixating macaque V1. Collinear flankers generally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptor blockade equally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Contrary to our hypothesis, flanker interactions were not systematically affected by either receptor blockade.",nan; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL INTEGRATION; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; LATERAL INTERACTIONS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; FEEDBACK; ACETYLCHOLINE; NEUROMODULATION

The subcortical connections of MST and FST were found to be very similar. Both areas were found to be reciprocally connected with the pulvinar, mainly with its medial subdivision, and with the claustrum. Nonreciprocal projections from both MST and FST were consistently found in the striatum (caudate and putamen), reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the pontine nuclei. The labeled terminals in the pons were in the dorsolateral, lateral, dorsal, and peduncular nuclei. Additional nonreciprocal projections were found in one MST and one FST case to the nucleus of the optic tract, and, in one FST case, to the lateral terminal nucleus. Finally, three cases showed a nonreciprocal projection to FST from the basal forebrain. The subcortical structures containing label following MST and FST injections were largely the same as those labeled after injections of the middle temporal visual area (MT), but the label within each structure after MST and FST injections was more widespread than that from MT, overlapping the distribution of label that has been reported after injections of parietal visual areas.

Dysregulation of the CRF system may underlie the pathophysiology of several disorders, including depression and anxiety. The distribution of CRF1 mRNA and CRF1 specific ligand binding has been reported by multiple groups in rodents using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, respectively. More recently, somewhat conflicting rodent anti-CRF1 immunohistochemical studies were reported. In this study we report the generation of an antihuman CRF1 antiserum and provide the first immunohistochemical description of CRF1 distribution in a primate brain, that of the rhesus monkey. The specificity of anti-CRF-R1 antiserum R221 was demonstrated using transfected hCRF(1)-expressing HEK 293 cells and rhesus monkey pituitary. CRF1-immunoreactive neurons were widespread in the rhesus brain. CRF1 staining was associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites and was primarily intracellular, suggesting a high rate of receptor turnover or receptor sequestration. Anti-CRF1 immunoreactivity was most abundant in pituitary, cerebellum, and in portions of brain stem associated with sensorimotor function. CRF1 staining was also observed in cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, portions of the basal ganglia, and thalamus. Staining was relatively low in prefrontal cortex and in limbic areas, which may reflect masking of the N-terminal epitope. The distribution of CRF1 immunoreactivity is suggestive of roles in attentional processing as well as the processing of motor and sensory information.

However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, 2 macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory, and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual, and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly suppressive (the audiovisual response is less than the strongest unisensory response) and subadditive (the audiovisual response is less than the sum of the auditory and the visual responses).

Neuroanatomical tracers were injected throughout the caudorostral extent of the auditory core and rostral STP by direct visualization of the cortical surface. Auditory cortical areas were distinguished by SMI-32 immunostaining for neurofilament, in addition to established cytoarchitectonic criteria. The results describe a pathway comprising step-wise projections from AI through the rostral and rostrotemporal fields of the core (R and RT), continuing to the recently identified rostrotemporal polar field (RTp) and the dorsal temporal pole. Each area was strongly and reciprocally connected with the areas immediately caudal and rostral to it, though deviations from strictly serial connectivity were observed. In RTp, inputs converged from core, belt, parabelt, and the auditory thalamus, as well as higher order cortical regions.

On the basis of its connectivity and physiology, this nucleus has been implicated in the control of saccadic eye movements, Because of the complexity of its afferent signals and its simple efferent signal, there must be much local interaction within the ZI to integrate these various afferents, The purpose of this study was to investigate, at the ultrastructural level, whether the ZI contains the anatomical substrata which could subserve the control of eye movements, Methods: Blocks of tissue from the ZI of macaque monkeys were prepared for electron microscopy using standard techniques. Some of these animals were taken specifically for electron microscopy, Others had received injections of tracer substances and were prepared for electron microscopy subsequent to tracer visualization, Results: Cell bodies of medium-large neurons were found in our preparations, They have large nucleoli and relatively small volumes of karyoplasm, Cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes have many synaptic contacts, Three types of synaptic profiles were found, designated Types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 profiles are symmetrical and contact cell bodies and small dendrites. Spe 2 profiles are thought to be presynaptic dendrites and may have symmetrical or asymmetrical contacts, Type 3 profiles are asymmetrical and primarily contact small dendrites, Many synapses contacted vesicle-containing profiles, In some cases, it was clear that these profiles participated in serial synapses on presumptive presynaptic dendrites, Other profiles appeared to be axoaxonic contacts, Conclusions: Afferent and efferent signals are Likely to be modulated extensively within the ZI. Therefore, there needs to be complex interactions between neuronal elements of the ZI and its afferents, This study demonstrates that this nucleus possesses the structural substrata to subserve diverse roles, such as the gating of saccadic eye movements.

In a sample of 4654 excitatory neurons, synapse cover did not correlate consistently with cell variety (pyramid or spiny stellate), soma size, synaptic apposition length or thalamic input. There were significant differences in somatic synapse cover per layer, but the pattern of differences in cover among layers differed significantly between animals, suggesting that laminar environment alone is not a generally applicable determinant of amount of inhibitory synapse cover. The pattern of cover for cells in different layers was, however, similar between the two hemispheres of an individual monkey. Measures of inhibitory synapse cover on four sets of pyramidal neurons in layers 5 and 6, each with different efferent projection targets, showed that the sets differed significantly from other cells in their respective layers, and differed significantly from each other. These findings demonstrate that there is unique circuitry for different subsystems within single layers of cortex and provide a rationale for the rich variety of cortical GABAergic interneurons within single layers.",nan; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MEYNERT CELLS; AREA 17; ORGANIZATION; AFFERENT; PATTERNS; NUMBER

Studies in rodents have provided insight in the interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic inputs relayed to the cortex by thalamocortical axons. Here we focus on the exploration of the developing primate visual system which points to embryonic thalamic axons exerting a profound, early instructive role on arealisation in the primate cortex, via an influence on cortical progenitor cell-cycle and mode of division.

Twelve right-handed, schizophrenic patients treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics and 6 healthy control subjects were studied with fMRI while performing a 2-back working memory task. Effective connectivity within a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for mnemonic information processing was assessed and compared between both groups. The path model included cortico-cortical connections comprising the parietal association cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as a cortico-cerebellar feedback loop comprising prefrontal cortex, contralateral cerebellum, and thalamus. Group differences were analyzed with a stacked models approach. Relative to normal controls, both patient groups revealed a pattern of reduced connectivity within the prefrontal-cerebellar and the cerebellar-thalamic limbs but enhanced connectivity in the thalamo-cortical limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuit. Moreover. a direct comparison of both treatment groups revealed enhanced connectivity in the interhemispheric connections between the cortical association areas in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. However, right prefrontal and left parieto-frontal path coefficients were lower in the patient group receiving atypical antispychotic drugs. The findings suggest that the relationship between pathology in cortical-subcortical cerebellar networks and associated functional connectivity is complex and may include aspects of increased and decreased levels of connectivity consistent with the notion of cognitive dysmetria in schizophrenia. The observed pronounced connectivity within thalamo-cortical projections could be attributed to a compensatory increase of thalamic input in the presence of disrupted effective connectivity within the preceding limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuitry. The study demonstrated the feasibility of structural equation modeling for the investigation of group and treatment-related differences in effective connectivity and provides a promising approach to further disentangle the relationship between altered functional capacity and associated fMRI signal changes.

Topography and synaptic organization of the pallidothalamic projection,"The objectives of this study were, on one hand, to better understand how the segregated functional pathways from the cerebral cortex through the striatopallidal complex emerged in the projections to the thalamus and, on the other hand, to compare the ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the pallidal efferents to the ventrolateral (VL) and centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei in primates. These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (''sensorimotor striatum'') and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (''associative striatum'') and the ventral striatum (''limbic striatum''), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.

The subjects actively stroked their fingertips over gratings that varied in groove width. Many cells in each location displayed average firing rates that incrementally reflected groove width dimensions (0.5-2.9 mm). Approximately 10% of cortical cells were more active to surfaces with narrower grooves, i.e., had negative graded response functions. All thalamic cells and similar to 50% of cortical cells with positive graded functions to gratings also showed increased responsiveness to contact force. Some cells also varied their activity with stroke speed. Many thalamic, a few primary somatosensory cortical cells, and no secondary somatosensory cortical cells showed periodic firing patterns that reflected the spatial-temporal frequency of stimulation. Responses to gratings of nearly every cell with negative graded responses and the remaining cortical cells with positive functions were independent of contact force and stroke velocity. The results only partially confirm predictions based on different models of texture perception that propose spatial, intensive, or cross modal neural codes.

We recognize three subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are architectonically distinct from the neighboring somatosensory and visual cortices. Furthermore, we show that the different parietal areas are differently connected with thalamic nuclei. The medial portion of PPC (mPPC) is connected primarily with the medial portion of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), whereas the lateral portion (lPPC) connects with the posterior complex (Po). The more caudolateral part of PPC (PtP) also projects to Po but can be distinguished from lPPC based on architectonic criteria. The primary somatic and visual cortices, neighboring PPC, are preferentially connected with the primary ventral posterior and dorsolateral geniculate nuclei, respectively, and less with the associational Po and LP. Particularly the border between the secondary visual cortex and the PPC has been a matter of controversy, but here we show that, although PPC subareas are connected with Po and medial LP, the medial and lateral secondary visual cortices are connected with lateral LP and a portion of medial LP different from that connected with PPC. The resulting delineations and specifications of connectivity with thalamic nuclei together with upcoming studies of cortical connectivity will facilitate detailed studies on the role of the subdivisions of PPC in the rat as diverse, higher order associative cortical areas, comparable to those described in the primate.for J.

Here we show that the receptive fields of these cells differ in size and response latency but not at random. We have found that in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) the receptive field size and response latency of neighboring neurons are significantly correlated: the larger the receptive field, the faster the response to visual stimuli. This correlation is widespread in LGN. It is found in groups of cells belonging to the same type ( e. g., Y cells), and of different types (i.e., X and Y), within a specific layer or across different layers. These results indicate that the inputs from the multiple geniculate afferents that converge onto a cortical cell ( approximately 30) are likely to arrive in a sequence determined by the receptive field size of the geniculate afferents. Recent studies have shown that the peak of the spatial frequency tuning of a cortical cell shifts toward higher frequencies as the response progresses in time. Our results are consistent with the idea that these shifts in spatial frequency tuning arise from differences in the response time course of the thalamic inputs.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELL; Y-CELLS; X-CELLS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; W-CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; NEURONS; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION

Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [ suppression index (SI) > 0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; V1 NEURONS; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; STRIATE CORTEX; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; KONIOCELLULAR CELLS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; RELAY CELLS

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

[C-11]CB-119 was synthesized with high specific activity by alkylation of a phenolic precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. In vitro autoradiographic studies using rhesus brain slices were carried out using [H-3]CB-119, and in vivo imaging studies were carried out using [C-11]CB-119 in rhesus monkeys under baseline and blocked conditions. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus brain showed the expected distribution pattern for CB1R with highest binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Lower binding was seen in the posterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and periventricular gray area, and the lowest binding was in the thalamic nuclei. The binding of [H-3]CB-119 was fully blocked by the addition of 10 mu M CB-119. Rhesus positron emission tomography imaging studies showed very good brain uptake and a distribution pattern consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. The kinetics of tracer uptake was slow. The brain uptake was blocked by pretreatment with taranabant, a CB1R inverse agonist.

Whether functional connections between CG neurons and LGN relay neurons obey or ignore the separation of feedforward visual signals into parallel processing streams is not known. Accordingly, there is some debate about whether CG neurons are morphologically heterogeneous or homogenous. Here we characterized the morphology of CG neurons in the ferret, a visual carnivore with distinct feedforward parallel processing streams, and compared the morphology of ferret CG neurons with CG neuronal morphology previously described in macaque monkeys [Briggs et al. (2016) Neuron, 90, 388]. We used a G-deleted rabies virus as a retrograde tracer to label CG neurons in adult ferrets. We then reconstructed complete dendritic morphologies for a large sample of virus-labeled CG neurons. Quantification of CG morphology revealed three distinct CG neuronal subtypes with striking similarities to the CG neuronal subtypes observed in macaques. These findings suggest that CG neurons may be morphologically diverse in a variety of highly visual mammals in which feedforward visual pathways are organized into parallel processing streams. Accordingly, these results provide support for the notion that CG feedback is functionally parallel stream-specific in ferrets and macaques.",corticogeniculate; LGN; morphology; RRID: AB_10013483; RRID: AB_221570; RRID: SCR_001622; RRID: SCR_001775; V1; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; STRIATE CORTEX; LAYER-VI; AREAS 17; SUBLAMINAR ORGANIZATION; FEEDBACK PATHWAY; LOCAL CIRCUITRY; CAT

Terminations from the amygdala were denser and larger in pOFC compared with the anterior cingulate cortex, which is also strongly connected with the amygdala. Axons from the amygdala terminated most densely in the upper layers of pOFC through large terminals. Most of these terminals innervated spines of presumed excitatory neurons and many were frequently multisynaptic and perforated, suggesting high synaptic efficacy. These amygdalar synapses in pOFC exceeded in size and specialization even thalamocortical terminals from the prefrontal-related thalamic mediodorsal nucleus to the middle cortical layers, which are thought to be highly efficient drivers of cortical neurons. Pathway terminals in the upper layers impinge on the apical dendrites of neurons in other layers, suggesting that the robust amygdalar projections may also activate neurons in layer 5 that project back to the amygdala and beyond to autonomic structures. Among inhibitory neurons, the amygdalar pathway innervated preferentially the neurochemical classes of calbindin and calretinin neurons in the upper layers of pOFC, which are synaptically suited to suppress noise and enhance signals. These features provide a circuit mechanism for flexibly shifting focus and adjusting emotional drive in processes disrupted in psychiatric disorders, such as phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder.",emotion and amygdala; neural circuits; OCD; orbitofrontal; synapse; thalamus; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AMPA RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; DISTINGUISHING DRIVERS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION

Tactile allodynia, in which innocuous tactile stimuli are perceived as painful, is common in patients with CPSP. Previous brain imaging studies have reported plastic changes in brain activity in patients with tactile allodynia after stroke, but a causal relationship between such changes and the symptoms has not been established. We recently developed a non-human primate (macaque) model of CPSP based on thalamic lesions, in which the animals show behavioral changes consistent with the occurrence of tactile allodynia. Here we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging under propofol anesthesia to investigate the changes in brain activation associated with the allodynia in this CPSP model. Before the lesion, innocuous tactile stimuli significantly activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. When behavioral changes were observed after the thalamic lesion, equivalent stimuli significantly activated pain-related brain areas, including the posterior insular cortex (PIC), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Moreover, when either PIC/SII or ACC was pharmacologically inactivated, the signs of tactile allodynia were dampened. Our results show that increased cortical activity plays a role in CPSP-induced allodynia.",Allodynia; Chronic pain; Functional brain imaging; Inactivation; Non-human primate; Thalamic pain; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; ANTERIOR CINGULOTOMY; NEURAL ACTIVATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; PROJECTIONS; MECHANISMS; ALLODYNIA; INSULA; LESION; ORGANIZATION

The goal of the study was to evaluate a high affinity and high selectivity antagonist, [C-11]P943, as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the 5-HT1B receptor. [C-11]P943 was synthesized via N-methylation of the precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide or [C-11]methyl triflate using automated modules. The average radiochemical yield was approx. 10% with radiochemical purity of >99% and specific activity of 8.8 +/- 3.6 mCi/nmol at the end-of-synthesis (n=37). PET imaging was performed in non-human primates with a high-resolution research tomograph scanner with a bolus/infusion paradigm. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the equilibrium ratios of regions to cerebellum. The tracer uptake was highest in the globus pallidus and occipital cortex, moderate in basal ganglia and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum, which is consistent with the known brain distribution of 5-HT1B receptors. Infusion of tracer at different specific activities (by adding various amount of unlabeled P943) reduced BPND values in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the saturability of the tracer binding. Blocking studies with GR127935 (2 mg/kg iv), a selective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D antagonist, resulted in reduction of BPND values by 42-95% across regions; for an example, in occipital region from 0.71 to 0.03, indicating a complete blockade. These results demonstrate the saturability and specificity of [C-11]P943 for 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting its suitability as a PET radiotracer for in vivo evaluations of the 5-HT1B receptor system in humans.

We reported previously how the anlage of the retrosplenial cortex merges with the immature presubicular zone in the fetal rhesus monkey at the end of the first trimester of gestation. In the present study, this caudal area was further defined on a chemoarchitectonic basis, particularly during the late prenatal and perinatal stages, which correspond to the development of the cingulate sulcus and temporal gyri, and the differentiation of the retrosplenial/subicular complex. Neurotensin (NT), a pyramidal cell marker in the limbic cortex, and parvalbumin (PV), a marker of a subset of inhibitory local circuit neurons in the hippocampal formation, were used as immunocytochemical markers. According to distinct chemoarchitectural patterns, (1) areas 29l and 29m of the retrosplenial cortex formed a triangle-shaped ventral expansion which merged with a similar but dorsal expansion of the pre/parasubicular fields. A temporal extension of area 29m down to area TH could not be detected. The pre/parasubiculum contributed with area 29m to the lateral bank of the calcarine sulcus as far as the most caudal extent of the hippocampal formation. (2) The lamina principalis interna of the presubiculum was well individualized and did not appear as a simple horizontal shift of adjoining fields. (3) NT and PV displayed a distinct temporal profile of development. NT was already expressed in the pyramidal cells of the prospective retrosplenial cortex and ventral hippocampal formation at E47 (term 165 days). Major pathways of the hippocampal formation and retrosplenial cortex (fimbria, fornix, angular and cingulum bundles) were progressively labeled indicating early developing projections. A large set of NT-positive afferents reached the retrosplenial cortex between E114 and E120. Their laminar distribution was compatible with a thalamic or a subicular origin. (4) The development of PV expression was delayed until the last quarter of gestation, supporting its proposal as a signal of functional onset. The developmental fate and the particular connections of the presubiculum suggest that its functional importance should be further investigated during infancy and adulthood.

For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.",ocular dominance; plasticity; receptive field; thalamocortical; thalamus; visual cortex; STRIATE CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; BINOCULAR DISPARITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; LAYER-IV; REPRESENTATION; AFFERENTS; PRIMATE

We find that, in the retina, alphaCamKII expression also differentiates two primary groups of ganglion cell, both characterized by broad, sparsely branching dendritic trees and cell bodies intermediate in size between the parvo- and magnocellular-projecting ganglion cells. Cells in the first group have three or four primary dendrites, a thick axon, and a rounded cell body and likely are made up of multiple types. In contrast, ganglion cells in the second group demonstrate a highly regular morphology, with strictly two primary dendrites and a thinner axon emanating from a smaller, elliptical cell body. This cell resembles the large sparse ganglion cell identified by others in retrograde labeling from the LGN and represents about 2% of all ganglion cells. In the optic nerve, alphaCamKII+ axons are also intermediate in size and form a bimodal distribution, correlating with the axonal sizes of the two groups of ganglion cell. For the LGN, we describe a group of aCamKII+ axon terminals with morphology consistent with terminals from retinal ganglion cells. These terminals form long, filamentous contacts with aCamKII+ relay cells and increase in frequency from the dorsal to the ventral koniocellular regions. Our results indicate that ganglion cells expressing aCamKII represent multiple projections to the brain, at least one of which provides input to one or more koniocellular regions of the LGN.

It may therefore be difficult to translate the results to the clinical situations. In the present study, the detailed change of NET occupancy was investigated among a wider range of doses in a more advanced manner. Two rhesus monkeys were examined using a high-resolution PET system with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 under baseline conditions and after steady-state infusion of different doses of atomoxetine (0.003 to 0.12 mg/kg per hour). NET occupancy of the thalamus, brainstem and anterior cingulate cortex was calculated using BPND obtained with the simplified reference tissue model. NET occupancy increased regionally and uniformly as the plasma concentration of atomoxetine increased. The estimated Kd value (the amount to occupy 50% of NET) in the thalamus was 16 ng/ml.

Loss of neurons has been reported in the cerebral cortex following immunodeficiency viral infection. but thalamic structures which may contribute to electrophysiological changes and neurological deficits have not been examined. In this study, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaques inoculated with macrophage-tropic, neurovirulent virus SIV(mac)239 (R71 and 17E) was examined for neuron loss using the optical fractionator method. Estimates of the number of neurons in the P layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus of age-matched control macaques ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 x 10(6), while the number of neurons in SIV infected macaques ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 x 10(6), reflecting neuron loss of up to 28%. Neuron loss was not observed in the magnocellular layers, The total number of glia and glial density were unchanged. Loss of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus was correlated with the pattern of neuropathological changes. Neuron loss was most severe in animals with encephalitis concentrated in the brain stem and subcortical white matter and was less apparent in animals with diffuse encephalitis, Neuron loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not explain changes observed in the visual evoked potential, which was severely affected in two animals which showed a loss of 24 and 26%, while it was normal in a third animal which showed neuron loss of 28%.",simian immunodeficiency virus; AIDS; lateral geniculate nucleus; fractionator; neuron death; NUMBER; INVOLVEMENT; NEOCORTEX; MONKEYS; CORTEX; AIDS

In this study, we examined the timing and occurrence of perisaccadic modulation of LGN single-unit activity in awake-behaving macaque monkeys while they made spontaneous saccades in the dark and made visually guided saccades to discrete stimuli located outside the receptive field. Our hypothesis was that the activity of LGN cells is modulated by efference copies of motor plans to produce saccadic eye movements and that this modulation depends neither on the presence of feedforward visual information nor on a corollary discharge of signals directing saccadic eye movements. On average, 25% of LGN cells demonstrated significant perisaccadic modulation. This modulation consisted of a moderate suppression of activity that began more than 100 ms prior to the initiation of a saccadic eye movement and continued beyond the termination of the saccadic eye movement. This suppression was followed by a large enhancement of activity after the eyes arrived at the next fixation. Although members of all three LGN relay cell classes (magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular) demonstrated significant saccade-related suppression and enhancement of activity, more cells demonstrated postsaccadic enhancement (25%) than perisaccadic suppression (17%). In no case did the timing of the modulation coincide directly with saccade duration. The degree of modulation observed did not vary with LGN cell class, LGN receptive field center location, center sign (ON-center or OFF-center), or saccade latency or velocity. The time course of modulation did, however, vary with saccade size such that suppression was longer for longer saccades. The fact that activity from a percentage of LGN cells from all cell classes was modulated in relationship to saccadic eye movements in the absence of direct visual stimulation suggests that this modulation is a general phenomenon not tied to specific types of visual stimuli. Similarly, because the onset of the modulation preceded eye movements by more than 100 ms, it is likely that this modulation reflects higher order motor-planning rather than a corollary of mechanisms in direct control of eye movements themselves. Finally, the fact that the largest modulation is a postsaccadic enhancement of activity may suggest that perisaccadic modulations are designed more for the facilitation of visual information processing once the eyes land at a new location than for filtering unwanted visual stimuli.",primates; vision; thalamus; eye movement; saccade; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL THRESHOLD; RETINOGENICULATE TRANSMISSION; UNIT-ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; SUPPRESSION; NEURONS; CELLS; CORTEX; CAT

Projections from the dentate and IA nuclei overlap in central parts of the body of RTP, but the terminal field of dentate axons extends dorsomedial and rostral to the terminal field of IA axons, and I4 terminal fields extend more ventrolaterally. A caudal to rostral topography of projections from each nucleus onto dorsal to ventral parts of RTP was seen. Projections from rostral parts of both nuclei terminate in a sublemniscal part of the nucleus. The topography of dentate and IA projections onto central to ventrolateral RTP appears to match somatotopic maps of these cerebellar nuclei with the somatotopic map of projections to RTP from primary motor cortex. Projections from caudal and ventral parts of the dentate nucleus appear to overlap oculomotor inputs to rostral, dorsal, and medial RTP from the frontal and supplementary eye fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor region of the caudal fastigial nucleus. Projections to the paramedian part of RTP from vestibular area y were also found in two cases that correlated with projections to vertical oculomotor motoneurons. The maps of dentate and IA projections onto RTP correlate predictably with maps of dentate and IA projections to the ventrolateral thalamus and subnuclei of the red nucleus that were made from these same cases (Stanton [1980b] J.

Effects of cortical feedback on the spatial properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus. J Neurophysiol 109: 889-899, 2013. First published October 24, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00194.2012.-Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.",summation; receptive field; visual cortex; corticothalamic; corticofugal; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INPUT X-CELLS; CORTICOGENICULATE PATHWAY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; STRIATE CORTEX; GANGLION-CELLS

However, the relative extent of both representations is subject to considerable species variation. The present study employed microelectrode mapping and anatomical tracing to investigate the location and extent of the ipsilateral representation in area 3b of the somatosensory cortex of squirrel monkeys. A small region, approximately 2 mm(2), was found to be responsive to stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. This region was located on the anteromedial border of area 3b, surrounded by the representation of the contralateral roof of the mouth. This region corresponded to areas of intense anterograde labeling following injections placed in the ventromedial portion of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus at the only sites where neural responses could be elicited by stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. The amount of thalamus and cortex given over to the ipsilateral representation in the squirrel monkey is small compared with that of the macaque monkey. This difference may be related to the lack of cheek pouches in the squirrel monkey, and therefore a different strategy for eating. The representation of the contralateral lower lip in area 3b was split by the representation of the contralateral upper lip. This split representation is in agreement with previous studies of the trigeminal representation in area 3b of the macaque monkey and may be a general feature of the representation of the trigeminal nerve in area 3b of primate cerebral cortex.

The brainstem and the thalamus were devoid of immunostained cell bodies, whereas in the hypothalamus immunopositive perikarya were observed in the supraoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamus, the preoptic region and in the arcuate nucleus. Our findings also showed that the hypothalamus is richer in immunostained fibres, and that in this region such fibres are more widely distributed than in the thalamus and upper brainstem. No immunopositive fibres were observed in the lower brainstem. Our results point to a more widespread distribution of LH-RH-immunostained perikarya in the cat hypothalamus than that previously reported in the cat; a similar distribution to that found in the rat, and a more restricted distribution than in primates. Additionally, our study shows a more widespread distribution of immunostained fibres in the cat brainstem and diencephalon than that previously described for other mammals. In this context, our results describe for the first time in the mammals central nervous system fibres containing LH-RH located in the stria medullaris of the thalamus, the supra mammillary decussation, the laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, the supraoptic nucleus, and the optic chiasm. Thus, our findings reveal that LH-RH-immunostained structures are widely distributed in the upper brainstem and in the diencephalon of the cat, suggesting that the peptide may be involved in several physiological functions.

This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.",nan; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; MODE NETWORK; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ASSOCIATION NETWORKS; DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS

Recently, we have demonstrated that JC virus can infect cerebellar granule cell neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons in immunosuppressed people. To examine whether SV40 neuronal infection occurs spontaneously in immunosuppressed macaques, we analyzed archival brain specimens from 20 simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus with AIDS and 1 cynomolgus post-transplant selected with SV40 brain infection from archival records from 1991 to 2012. In addition to white matter SV40 distribution in classic demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, some of the 21 monkeys exhibited meningeal, subpial neocortical, and periventricular virus. This distribution pattern corresponded to broader viral tropism with neuronal infection in 14 (66.7%) of 21 cases. In all 14 cases, identified neurons were positive for early SV40 transcript large T antigen, but only 4 of the 14 cases exhibited Late viral transcript viral protein 1-positive neurons. SV40-infected neurons were detected in frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and brain stem.

The functions of this top-down modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.",Functional MRI; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Lipreading; Speech; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CORTICOFUGAL MODULATION; AUDITORY-SYSTEM; HEARING LIPS; RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION

In the present study, adult pig-tailed macaques were infected with a highly neuropathogenic virus SIVsmmFGb. MT imaging was exploited to examine the monkey brains before simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks post-SIV inoculation. Blood samples were collected from each animal for monitoring CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells before each MRI scan. The MT ratios (MTR) in several brain regions of interest were evaluated longitudinally. Significant reductions of MTR were observed in whole brain and selected regions of interest (genu, splenium, thalamus, caudate, centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, frontal gray matter, and putamen) in the SIV-infected monkeys, consistent with those reported previously in HIV patients. In particular, the longitudinal results indicate that abnormal MTR reduction can be detected as early as in 2 weeks and MTR may be more sensitive to the brain injury in cortical regions than in subcortical regions during acute SIV infection. In addition, MTR reduction in genu, centrum semiovale, and thalamus significantly correlated with the CD4(+) T cell percentage decrease. Also, the MTR reduction in thalamus correlated with the CD8(+) T cell percentage elevation. Taken together, this study reported the longitudinal evolution of MTR in different brain regions during SIV infection and further validates previous findings in HIV patients. The preliminary results suggest that MT imaging could be a robust and sensitive approach to characterize the neurodegeneration after SIV or HIV infection.",nan; SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; TISSUE-SPECIFIC COMPARTMENTALIZATION; WHOLE-BRAIN; TRANSFER CONTRAST; NEUROPATHOGENIC SIVSMMFGB; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SIV INFECTION; WHITE-MATTER; HIV

Following dopaminergic denervation, pallidothalamic-projecting neurons are known to be hyperactive, whereas a reduction in GPi activity is typically observed in lesioned animals showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Besides the mRNAs coding for GABAergic markers (GAD65 and GAD67), we show that all GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets also express transcripts for the isoforms 1 and 2 of the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNA). Indeed, dual immunofluorescent detection of GAD67 and vGlut1/2 confirmed the data gathered from in situ hybridization experiments, therefore demonstrating that the detected mRNAs are translated into the related proteins. Furthermore, the dopaminergic lesion resulted in an up-regulation of expression levels for both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA within identified pallidothalamic-projecting neurons. This was coupled with a down-regulation of GAD65/67 mRNA expression levels in GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets in monkeys showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. By contrast, the patterns of gene expression for both vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNAs remained unchanged across GPi projection neurons in control, MPTP-treated and dyskinetic monkeys. In summary, both GABAergic and glutamatergic markers were co-expressed by GPi efferent neurons in primates. Although the status of the dopaminergic system directly modulates the expression levels of GAD65/67 mRNA, the observed expression of vGlut1/2 mRNA is not regulated by either dopaminergic removal or by continuous stimulation with dopaminergic agonists.",Basal ganglia; Globus pallidus; Ventral thalamus; vGlut; GAD; GABA; Glutamate; Dyskinesia; Parkinson's disease; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; SUBSTANCE-P-LIKE; ENTOPEDUNCULAR NUCLEUS; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; DOPAMINERGIC TERMINALS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; FIBER TERMINALS; EXPRESSION; RAT

The main efferent projections from the globus pallidus are to the subthalamus, to the thalamus, and to the substantia nigra. Although these projections have been well established for the dorsal pallidum, the projections of the ventral pallidum have not been explored in primates. The results of this study add an important link in how information from the limbic lobe is channeled through the basal ganglia in monkeys. Anterograde tracers, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, and tritiated amino acids were injected into various regions of the ventral pallidum. The descending efferent projection from the ventral pallidum in monkeys terminates primarily in the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamus, in the substantia nigra, and in the lateral habenular nucleus. Although terminals are also found in the thalamus, these are relatively sparse. The projections to the subthalamic nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus are topographically arranged, while those to the substantia nigra are not. These results suggest that pathways from distinct pallidal regions that receive specific striatal input terminate in distinct regions of the subthalamic/hypothalamic regions, thus maintaining a topographic arrangement. Projections to the substantia nigra, however, overlap extensively, suggesting convergence of terminals from different ventral pallidal regions. The relatively small projection to the thalamus raises the question that without a prominent thalamic projection, is this system parallel to that described for the dorsal globus pallidus?",BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; STRIATUM; THALAMUS; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; SUBSTANCE-P IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PRIMATE GLOBUS PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; STRIATOPALLIDAL PARTS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PHA-L; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS

The two principal tactile processing areas in the cerebral cortex, somatosensory areas I and II, receive direct projections from the thalamus and, as well, are linked through intracortical reciprocal connections. Tactile information may therefore be conveyed to SII, for example, over either a direct path from the thalamus or an indirect, or serial, path from the thalamus via SI. 2. Reports in recent years that tactile responsiveness within the hand area of SII was abolished by surgical ablation of the hand area of the postcentral, or SI, area of cortex in the macaque and marmoset monkeys indicated that a serial processing scheme may operate, at least in primates. However, as the surgical ablation is clearly irreversible and precludes examination of individual SII neurons in both the control and test circumstances, that is, when SI is intact and when it is inactivated, we have examined in the cat, the rabbit and the marmoset monkey the behaviour of SII neurons before, during and after the selective, rapidly-reversible inactivation of SI by means of localized cooling. 3. The results demonstrate that in the cat and rabbit, SII responsiveness is never abolished and infrequently affected by SI inactivation and that tactile inputs to SII therefore traverse a direct path from thalamus, organized in parallel with that to SI. In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), in contrast to earlier studies based on ablation of SI we found that with reversible inactivation of SI, SII responsiveness was unaffected in 25% of neurons and, although reduced in the remainder, was rarely abolished (<10% of SII neurons). 4. The results indicate that there is substantial direct thalamic input to SII, even in this simian primate, and therefore necessitate revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII.",cat; cerebral cortex; cutaneous; parallel processing; primate; sensory systems; serial processing; somatosensory cortex; tactile; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; LATERAL SULCUS; 2ND; SII; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; MACAQUES; NEURONS; FIELDS

COMPARISON OF SPINE ACQUISITION AND DENDRITIC GROWTH OF LAYER-4C ALPHA-SPINY AND BETA-SPINY STELLATE NEURONS,"A quantitative study has been made from Golgi impregnations of the maturation of dendrites and their spines on spiny stellate neurons in the macaque monkey primary visual cortex. The neurons studied lay within either the alpha or the beta division of lamina 4C; previous workers have shown the alpha division neurons to be contacted by thalamic axon terminals arising from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and the beta division neurons to be contacted by parvocellular LGN inputs. Most thalamic terminals and perhaps the majority of other type 1 (Colonnier, '81), presumed excitatory, inputs to these cells make synaptic contacts on the tips of their dendritic spines. Measurement was made of relative changes in the total number of spines on these alpha and beta spiny neurons over age by measuring both spine density along the dendrites and dendritic arbor size in single 90-mu-m sections from Golgi rapid preparations. Our previous work (Lund et al., '77; Boothe et al., '79) showed a marked proliferation and attrition of spines and dendritic branches to occur in the early postnatal weeks; Rakic et al. ('86) have since proposed that there is a cortexwide synchrony of synapse acquisition and loss during this same period. However, different visual capacities channelled via the magnocellular and parvicellular geniculate relays show different maturational rates (Harwerth et al., '86). This study indicates that the anatomical maturation of spines on the alpha and beta neurons is not temporally coincident from birth to 30 weeks. During this period, phases of spine acquisition and loss on alpha neurons precedes similar phases on beta neurons. The alpha neurons carry a peak spine population at 5-8 weeks postnatal, whereas the beta neurons carry their peak spine populations between 8 and 24 weeks postnatal. At all ages prior to 30 weeks, the two sets of neurons carry quite different total spine populations. Close to 30 weeks of age, the total spine coverage has fallen on both sets of neurons and becomes identical between the alpha and beta neurons. In animals aged 30 weeks to adult, spine coverage per neuron is maintained at a common figure for the alpha and beta neurons despite further growth and disparate dendritic arbor sizes and different local spine densities in the two groups; this suggests that some common sampling paradigm between pre- and postsynaptic elements is adopted by the alpha and beta neurons and also suggests the development of a close functional correlation between the two sets of neurons.",VISION; PRIMATE; DENDRITIC SPINE; CEREBRAL CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; MACACA-NEMESTRINA; AREA 17; GOLGI; CAT; SYNAPSES

Much of our understanding of the physiology of LGN neurons comes from data collected in anaesthetized animals. This study examines the visual responses of LGN neurons in alert animals and compares these responses to those from anaesthetized animals. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, LGN neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with stronger responses and follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies. Stronger responses are likely to translate into an increased coupling between the LGN and visual cortex, as firing rate and interspike interval are known to influence the dynamics of synaptic communication between the two structures. Abstract Despite the increasing use of alert animals for studies aimed at understanding visual processing in the cerebral cortex, relatively little attention has been focused on quantifying the response properties of neurons that provide input to the cortex. Here, we examine the response properties of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in the alert macaque monkey and compare these responses to those in the anaesthetized animal. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre-surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.",nan; THALAMIC RELAY CELLS; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; GENERAL-ANESTHETICS; PRIMATE RETINA; X-LIKE; NEURONS; CORTEX; CAT; MODES

Four of these cases were infants in which the injections revealed transient patterns of inputs to TE from various other brain regions. Although each monkey showed extensive label in the pulvinar nucleus and other subcortical structures, none showed unambiguous labelling in the dLGN.

We investigated the time-varying changes of the putaminal spiking activity and the spectral power of local field potentials (LFPs) during a task where the rhythmic tapping of monkeys was guided by isochronous stimuli separated by a fixed duration (synchronization phase), followed by a period of internally timed movements (continuation phase). We found that the power of both bands and the discharge rate of cells showed an orderly change in magnitude as a function of the duration and/or the serial order of the intervals executed rhythmically. More LFPs were tuned to duration and/or serial order in the beta-than the gamma-band, although different values of preferred features were represented by single cells and by both bands. Importantly, in the LFPs tuned to serial order, there was a strong bias toward the continuation phase for the beta-band when aligned to movements, and a bias toward the synchronization phase for the gamma-band when aligned to the stimuli. Our results suggest that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of CBGT, during internally driven rhythmic tapping.",interval tuning; rhesus monkey; spikes and LFPs; synchronization-continuation task; timing; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS OSCILLATIONS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; INTERVAL DISCRIMINATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; TIME PERCEPTION; HAND MOVEMENT

Studies of incentive processing have repeatedly demonstrated activation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), thalamus, and anterior insula, three key components of reward neurocircuitry. The contribution of the thalamus to this circuitry in humans has been relatively ignored, a gap that needs to be filled, given the central role of this structure in processing and filtering information. This study aimed to understand how these three regions function as a network during gain or loss anticipation in adults and youth. Towards this goal, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to examine effective connectivity among these three nodes in healthy adults and adolescents who performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Seven connectivity models, based on anatomic connections, were tested. They were estimated for incentive anticipation and underwent Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) to determine the best-fit model for each adult and adolescent group. Connection strengths were extracted from the best-fit model and examined for significance in each group. These variables were then entered into a linear mixed model to test between-group effects on effective connectivity in reward neurocircuitry. The best-fit model for both groups included all possible anatomic connections. Three main findings emerged: (1) Across the task, thalamus and insula significantly influenced NAc; (2) A broader set of significant connections was found for the loss-cue condition than the gain-cue condition in both groups; (3) Finally, between-group comparisons of connectivity strength failed to detect statistical differences, suggesting that adults and adolescents use this incentive-processing network in a similar manner. This study demonstrates the way in which the thalamus and insula influence the NAc during incentive processing in humans. Specifically, this is the first study to demonstrate in humans the key role of thalamus projections onto the NAc in support of reward processing. Our results suggest that anticipation of gain/loss involves an 'alerting' signal (thalamus) that converges with interoceptive information (insula) to shape action selection programs in the ventral striatum.

Eleven aged animals, 21-26-years old, were included in the analysis. Regional CMRglc, normalized to values for the entire brain, were determined for the dorsal prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. The aged animals exhibited significant DR deficits relative to a cohort of normal young monkeys. Variability in DR performance among the aged subjects was significantly correlated with relative hippocampal rCMRglc, and chronological age was a reliable predictor of orbitofrontal rCMRglc ratios. This pattern of results suggests that DR impairments in the aged monkey may partly reflect ape-related dysfunction distributed among multiple limbic system structures that participate in normal learning and memory. Overall, the findings support the use of positron emission tomography in efforts to define the relationship between cognitive performance, age, and brain physiology in nonhuman primates.

In the present study, we report that the expression of occ1 mRNA in the macaque neocortex can be classified into two modes. The first mode is associated with excitatory neurons distributed in the major thalamocortical recipient layers that exhibit strong cytochrome oxidase activity. This is highly prominent in V1. The second mode is associated with parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and is distributed across the macaque neocortex, In V1, monocular deprivation showed that occ1 mRNA expression in excitatory neurons was markedly dependent on afferent activity, whereas that in GABAergic interneurons was not. Cross-species comparison showed specific differences in expression. In marmosets, a strong expression was observed in V1 similarly to macaques. The occ1 mRNA expression, however, was generally weak in the mouse neocortex. In rabbit and ferret cortices, the strong expression was observed only in GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that activity-dependent occ1 mRNA expression in the excitatory neurons of V1 was caused by a novel mechanism acquired by primates after their separation from other lineages.",brain evolution; in situ hybridization; Macaca fuscata; TSC-36; V1-specific; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CALBINDIN D-28K; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; FOLLISTATIN-LIKE; MONKEY

Pie describe the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle lesions, review lesions described in literature, and discuss possible pharmacologic mechanisms for soman-induced neuron necrosis. Methods: In this retrospective, histopathologic study, records were obtained for 36 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were euthanized 10 days after soman exposure, from a larger group of 103 monkeys that were exposed to soman and used for pharmacologic and lethality studies. Results: Brain lesions were seen in 9 of 15 animals that convulsed and in only 1 of 21 that did not convulse. The brain lesions in our primates were limited to the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (of one animal), and consisted of neuron necrosis and dropout, spongiosis, gliosis, astrocytosis, and vascularization, Heart lesions consisted of myocardial degeneration and necrosis. Three animals had brain and heart lesions, 7 had brain lesions only, and 3 had heart Lesions only. Skeletal muscle lesions, although minimal to mild, were in most of the animals, whether they had convulsed, but most had muscular tremors. These lesions were in the biceps brachii (11 of 22 monkeys), anterior tibialis (8/22), biceps femoris (7/22), flexor carpi radialis (5/22), gastrocnemius (3/22), and diaphragm (1/22). The limited literature on soman lesions in primate brain and heart, and the limited information on skeletal muscle lesions, is reviewed. Conclusions: Brain lesions were not as wide-spread as reported in other studies of primates and rodents, and were significantly associated with convulsions. Unlike other studies using rodents, we observed poor correlation between heart and brain lesions; thus, a single hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis for the brain and heart lesions may be difficult to establish.",nan; INDUCED SEIZURES; RAT; NEUROPATHOLOGY; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; MEMANTINE; PRIMATES; DAMAGE

Differentiation of the pontine sensory syndrome from the thalamic sensory syndrome has generally been made on the basis of distribution of sensory loss and involvement of specific sensory modalities but not without uncertainties and difficulties. Because the pontine tegmentum plays a pivotal role in generating horizontal eye movement, we attempted to discriminate these 2 syndromes by analyzing horizontal eye movements in stroke patients with pure hemisensory syndrome. Methods-Horizontal saccade, pursuit, vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR), and VOR cancellation (VORC) were evaluated using electro-oculography in 6 patients with hemisensory syndromes, 3 due to pontine stroke and 3 due to thalamic stroke, and all were verified by MRI or CT. In addition, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded. Results-Smooth pursuit and VORC directed toward the side of the lesion were impaired unilaterally in patients with pontine sensory stroke, whereas those 2 movements were intact bilaterally in patients with thalamic sensory stroke. Saccade and VOR were preserved in all patients. SEPs were normal in all patients with pontine and thalamic sensory strokes.

Interpretations of available data have led to opposing 'information funneling' and 'parallel processing' hypotheses. Using motor circuit as a model, we examined whether cortico-subcortical circuits, especially cortico-basal ganglia circuits, are funneled or parallel in the control of volitional movement. Twenty-five healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activated clusters during self-initiated, sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements of the left hand were identified in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), right lateral premotor cortex (PM) and primary motor cortex (M1), and in the right striatum and thalamus. These functionally defined clusters were applied to probabilistic tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI to examine patterns of connectivity. Striatal and thalamic sub-regions with high probabilities of connection to the motor cortices partially overlapped, with connection to the two premotor areas outspreading rostrally relative to M1. We suggest that, on a macroscopic anatomical level, there is overlap as well as segregation among connections of the motor cortices with the striatum and thalamus. This supports the notion that neuronal information of the motor cortices is funneled, and parallel processing is not an exclusive principle in the basal ganglia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on a wiring diagram that spans the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus of the macaque brain, we identify robust modules in the network that provide a mesoscopic-level description of its topological architecture. Surprisingly, we find that the modular architecture facilitates rapid communication across the network, instead of localizing activity as is typically expected in networks having community organization. By considering processes of diffusive spreading and coordination, we demonstrate that the specific pattern of inter-and intramodular connectivity in the network allows propagation to be even faster than equivalent randomized networks with or without modular structure. This pattern of connectivity is seen at different scales and is conserved across principal cortical divisions, as well as subcortical structures. Furthermore, we find that the physical proximity between areas is insufficient to explain the modular organization, as similar mesoscopic structures can be obtained even after factoring out the effect of distance constraints on the connectivity. By supplementing the topological information about the macaque connectome with physical locations, volumes, and functions of the constituent areas and analyzing this augmented dataset, we reveal a counterintuitive role played by the modular architecture of the brain in promoting global coordination of its activity. It suggests a possible explanation for the ubiquity of modularity in brain networks.",nan; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL PATHWAYS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; ORGANIZATION; MONKEY

However, little is known about how prenatal perturbation translates into adult brain dysfunction. Here, we use a longitudinal study design to examine the effects of disruption of early gestational neurogenesis on brain volume in the non-human primate. Methods and Principal Findings: Five Rhesus macaques were exposed to x-irradiation in early gestation (E30-E41), and four control monkeys were sham-irradiated at comparable ages. Whole brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 and 5 years of age. Volumes of whole cerebrum, cortical gray matter, caudate, putamen, and thalamus were estimated using semi-automated segmentation methods and high dimensional brain mapping. Volume reductions spanning all ages were observed in irradiated monkeys in the putamen (15-24%, p = 0.01) and in cortical gray matter (6-15%, p = 0.01). Upon covarying for whole cerebral volume, group differences were reduced to trend levels (putamen: p = 0.07; cortical gray matter: p = 0.08). No group-by-age effects were significant. Conclusions: Due to the small number of observations, the conclusions drawn from this study must be viewed as tentative. Early gestational irradiation may result in non-uniform reduction of gray matter, mainly affecting the putamen and cerebral cortex. This may be relevant to understanding how early prenatal environmental insult could lead to brain morphological differences in neurodevelopmental diseases.",nan; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMATE VISUAL-CORTEX; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RISK; MRI; NEURONS

We now describe the presence and distribution of the PTH2R and TIP39 in the brain of primates using a range of tissues and ages from macaque and human brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry of TIP39 mRNA, studied in young macaque brain, due to its possible decline beyond late postnatal ages, was present only in the thalamic subparafascicular area and the pontine medial paralemniscal nucleus. In contrast, in situ hybridization histochemistry in macaque identified high levels of PTH2R expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, medial geniculate, and the Pontine tegmentum. PTH2R mRNA was also detected in several human brain areas by RT-PCR. The distribution of PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in human, determined by immunocytochemistry, was similar to that in rodents, including dense fiber networks in the medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular, periventricular and infundibular (arcuate) nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, median eminence, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nuclei, medullary dorsal reticular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Co-localization suggested that PTH2R fibers are glutamatergic, and that TIP39 may directly influence hypophysiotropic somatostatin containing and indirectly influence corticotropin releasing-hormone containing neurons. The results demonstrate that TIP39 and the PTH2R are expressed in the brain of primates in locations that suggest involvement in regulation of fear, anxiety, reproductive behaviors, release of pituitary hormones, and nociception.

In this review, we summarize recent findings where molecular biological techniques have revealed a small number of area-specific genes in the nonhuman primate cortex. One of these (occl) is strongly expressed in primary visual cortex and is associated with thalamocortical connections. Another gene, RBP, is more strongly expressed in association areas. It is not clear whether RBP might be linked with any particular connectional system, but several possibilities are raised. We also discuss possible roles of area-specific genes in postnatal development, and conclude with a brief sketch of future directions.

Different types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons provide output to different thalamic nuclei, and it is therefore of interest to understand the sources of functional input to these neurons. We studied the morphologies and local excitatory input to individual layer 6 neurons in rat visual cortex by combining intracellular labeling and recording with laser-scanning photostimulation. As in previous photostimulation studies, we found significant differences in the sources of local excitatory input to different cell types. Most notably, there were differences in local input to neurons that, based on analogy to barrel cortex, are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus. The more striking finding, however, was the paucity of superficial layer input to layer 6 neurons in the rat visual cortex, contrasting sharply with layer 6 neurons in the primate visual cortex. These observations provide insight into differences in function between cortical projections to first-order versus higher-order thalamic nuclei and also show that these circuits can be organized differently in different species.",nan; MACAQUE MONKEY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MAMMALIAN BRAINS; AREA 17; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION; PATHWAYS; INPUT; CELLS; PHOTOSTIMULATION

Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinyl methoxy)-5-(3 '-F-18-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-Nifrolene) using PET","Imaging agents for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors in the brain have been under way for studying various CNS disorders. Previous studies from our laboratories have reported the successful development of agonist, F-18-nifene. In attempts to develop potential antagonists, F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine were previously reported. Further optimization of these fluoropropyl derivatives has now been carried out resulting in 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifrolene) as a new high affinity agent for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifrolene in rat brain homogenate assays - labeled with H-3-cytisine - exhibited a binding affinity of 0.36 nM. The fluorine-18 analog. F-18-nifrolene, was synthesized in approximately 10%-20% yield and specific activity was estimated to be >2000 Ci/mmol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding to anterior thalamic nuclei, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with AN receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >90% by 300 mu M nicotine. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio (>10) was the highest for F-18-nifrolene with several other regions showing selective binding. In vivo rat PET studies exhibited rapid uptake of F-18-nifrolene in the brain with specific retention in the thalamus and other brain regions while clearing out from the cerebellum. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio value in the rat was >4. Administration of nicotine caused a rapid decline in the thalamic 18F-nifrolene suggesting reversible binding to nicotinic receptors. PET imaging studies of F-18-nifrolene in anesthetized rhesus monkey revealed highest binding in the thalamus followed by regions of the lateral cingulated and temporal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least binding. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio in the monkey brain was >3 at 120 min. These ratios of F-18-nifrolene are higher than measured for F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine. F-18-Nifrolene thus shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR.

In this study, to explore potential anatomical bases for these neuronal activities, we injected retrograde tracers (CTB-Alexa-488 and CTB-gold) into the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus and examined the distribution of labeled cell bodies in macaque monkey brains. The Nissl staining showed that the cortex in the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus has consistent layer 4 which means that the cortical region is a part of the granular prefrontal cortex. The injection site belonged to the sulcal portion of area 9m in two cases and the sulcal portion of area 8Bm in one case. In addition to the continuous distribution of labeled cells in the two areas (areas 9m and 8Bm) around the injection site, the labeled cells were densely distributed in the cingulate areas (areas 24, 32, and 23) in all the cases. The dense labeling of cells was also found in other prefrontal areas (areas 46, 10, 11, and 12) in the two cases with injection into the sulcal portion of area 9m, whereas the dense labeling of cells was found in pre-motor areas (F6 and F7) in the case with injection into the sulcal portion of area 8Bm. The dense labeling of cells in the prefrontal and premotor areas was more similar to those previously found after injections into dorsal parts of areas 9 and 8B.

Its therapeutic effect may depend on its ability to enter the brain and bind to the oxytocin receptor. To date, the brain tissue penetrance of intranasal oxytocin has not been demonstrated. In this nonhuman primate study, we administer deuterated oxytocin intranasally and intravenously to rhesus macaques and measure, with mass spectrometry, concentrations of labeled (exogenously administered) and endogenous oxytocin in 12 brain regions two hours after oxytocin administration. Labeled oxytocin is quantified after intranasal (not intravenous) administration in brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, brainstem, and thalamus) that lie in the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. These results suggest that intranasal administration bypasses the blood-brain barrier, delivering oxytocin to specific brain regions, such as the striatum, where oxytocin acts to impact motivated behaviors. Further, high concentrations of endogenous oxytocin are in regions that overlap with projection fields of oxytocinergic neurons. The location and extent of intranasal oxytocin brain penetrance has not been shown. Here the authors show that oxytocin, administered intranasally, enters brain regions along the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and there, reaches biologically relevant concentrations.",nan; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE; ANIMAL-MODELS; DELIVERY; RELEASE; DRUG; SYSTEM; TISSUES; NASAL

SIV infected model for detecting the neurological changes with progression was studied. Methods: In the study, six rhesus macaques infected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were scanned by resting-state fMRI at the following time points: before SIV inoculation (baseline), 12 weeks and 24 weeks post inoculation (12 wpi, 24 wpi). Meanwhile, the immunological parameters including serum percentage of CD4+ T cell, CD4/CD8 ratio and absolute CD4+ T cell number were measured and analyzed. Results: In comparison of baseline, significant decreased ReHo was found in the left superior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, right precuneus, left angular gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus; in contrast increased ReHo in putamen at 12 wpi. Moreover, at the time of 24 wpi, decreased ReHo was observed in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulated gyrus and thalamus, while ReHo was increased in the left putamen, hippocampus, left anterior cingulated cortex and precentral cortex. The correlation analysis revealed that ReHo in the superior frontal gyrus showed negative association with CD4/CD8 ratio and positive with absolute CD4+ T cell number. The correlation analysis showed that percentage of CD4+ was correlated with the ReHo values in right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral thalamus and amygdala positively; negative relationship with left putamen, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior and middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The study first indicates that hippocampus, putamen, frontal and occipital lobe were impaired by using rs-fMRI and correlated with immunological parameters. Thus, ReHo value can be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of spontaneous brain activity changes caused by the progression of neurological impairments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Relative involvements of neurochemically distinct subterritories in the ventral pallidum and adjacent parts of the rostroventral forebrain,"Retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing studies were carried out to determine whether the capacity of the nucleus accumbens to influence the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus via ventral striatopallidothalamic connections disproportionately favors the shell over the core subterritory. After injections of Fluoro-Gold into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in sections also processed for calbindin-D 28-kD and neurotensin immunoreactivities to facilitate identification of subterritories in the ventral pallidum. Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells were counted in series of sections cut through the ventral pallidum, rostral globus pallidus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, and the sublenticular gray region, including parts of the extended amygdala. Data were expressed as cells/unit area and as percentages of all labeled forebrain cells. Mediodorsal nucleus-projecting rostroventral forebrain neurons were most numerous in the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum and pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle. Few were observed in the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. In addition, following injections into the ventral pallidum, anterogradely transported biotinylated dextran amine was evaluated in sections processed for calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Injection into the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum resulted in robust anterograde labeling of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area and weak labeling of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Conversely, after injection into the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, anterograde labeling was weak in the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area, but robust in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. The results are consistent with a predominant accumbens shell influence on the mediodorsal nucleus and with cortico-ventral striatopallidal-thalamocortical pathways that begin and end in different parts of the frontal lobe.

Much is known about the adaptive effects of constant stimulation over prolonged periods. However, there are open questions regarding adaptation to stimuli that are changing over time, interrupted, or repeated. Feature-specific adaptation to repeating stimuli has been shown to occur as early as primary visual cortex (V1), but there is also evidence for more generalized, fatigue-like adaptation that might occur at an earlier stage of processing. Here, we show adaptation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake, fixating monkeys following brief (1 s) exposure to repeated cycles of a 4-Hz drifting grating. We examined the relative change of each neuron's response across successive (repeated) grating cycles. We found that neurons from all cell classes (parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular) showed significant adaptation. However, only magnocellular neurons showed adaptation when responses were averaged to a population response. In contrast to firing rates, response variability was largely unaffected. Finally, adaptation was comparable between monocular and binocular stimulation, suggesting that rapid LGN adaptation is monocular in nature. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural adaptation can be defined as reduction of spiking responses following repeated or prolonged stimulation. Adaptation helps adjust neural responsiveness to avoid saturation and has been suggested to improve perceptual selectivity, information transmission, and predictive coding.

Neuropathological examination revealed glial fibrillary tangles (GPTs) mainly distributed in the putamen, caudate nucleus. thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, red nucleus. globus pallidus, trapezoid body, pyramid, pens and medulla oblongata of the brain, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the thalamic nuclei. These structures were positively stained by the modified Gallyas-Braak (GB) method and immunostained for tau. The tau-positive argyrophilic GFTs were morphologically classified into four types, as in human cases. i.e.. tufts of abnormal fibers (TAFs), thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSAs). glial coiled bodies (GCBs) and argyrophilic threads (ATs) depending on their GB profiles, and GCBs were the major structures in this case. Some of these structures were also immunoreactive for alpha-synuclein. The glial cells possessing the structures were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein. a marker for astrocytes, indicating that the argyrophilic GFTs were present in oligodendroglia. In addition, marked neuronal loss and ubiquitin-positive spheroid bodies were observed in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus. According to the characteristic distribution of the argyrophilic structures in neurons and glial cells as well as clinical signs, the monkey might have suffered from a neurodegenerative disease such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

To address this issue, we analyzed the distribution patterns of cortico-striatal and cortico-brainstem axon terminals and the origin of thalamocortical and intracortical fibers by injecting anterograde/ retrograde tracers into physiologically and morphologically defined jaw movement-related cortical areas. Four areas were identified in the macaque monkey: the primary and supplementary orofacial motor areas (MIoro and SMAoro) and the principal and deep parts of the cortical masticatory area (CMaAp and CMaAd), where intracortical microstimulation produced single twitch-like or rhythmic jaw movements, respectively. Tracer injections into these areas labeled terminals in the ipsilateral putamen in a topographic fashion (MIoro vs. SMAoro and CMaAp vs. CMaAd), in the lateral reticular formation and trigeminal sensory nuclei contralaterally (MIoro and CMaAp) or bilaterally (SMAoro) in a complex manner of segregation vs. overlap, and in the medial parabranchial and Kolliker-Fuse nuclei contralaterally (CMaAd). The MIoro and CMaAp received thalamic projections from the ventrolateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei, the SMAoro from the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei, and the CMaAd from the ventroposteromedial nucleus. The MIoro, SMAoro, CMaAp, and CMaAd received intracortical projections from the ventral premotor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and rostral cingulate motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and area 7b, and various sensory areas. In addition, the MIoro and CMaAp received projections from the three other jaw movement-related areas. Our results suggest that the four jaw movement-related cortical areas may play important roles in the formation of distinctive masticatory patterns.",mastication; basal ganglia; striatum; lateral tegmental field; trigeminal premotor neuron; thalamus; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; LOWER BRAIN-STEM; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; CORTICAL MASTICATORY AREA; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MUSCLE-SPINDLE AFFERENTS; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY

Ten healthy human volunteers underwent brain scan examinations by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two optic flow experiments. In addition to the classical LGN-V1-hMT + pathway, our results showed a significant direct influence of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded in LGN over that in hMT +, not mediated by V1 activity, which strongly supports the existence of a bilateral pathway that connects LGN directly to hMT + and serves visual motion processing. Furthermore, we evaluated the relative latencies among areas functionally connected in the processing of visual motion. Using LGN as a reference region, hMT + exhibited a statistically significant earlier peak of activation as compared to V1. In conclusion, our findings suggest the co-existence of an alternative route that directly links LGN to hMT +, bypassing V1. This direct pathway may play a significant functional role for the faster detection of motion and may contribute to explain persistence of unconscious motion detection in individuals with severe destruction of primary visual cortex (blindsight).

We have developed pain models for cynomolgus macaques because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the cynomolgus macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaques are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. The purpose of this study is to elucidate pain-related brain activation regions in the macaque models using fMRI. Generally, pain testing in animal models has been based on avoidance behavior against pain stimuli. However, we identified pain-related brain activation regions using fMRI under propofol anesthesia as a more objective evaluation method. In the macaque model of chymopapain-induced discogenic low back pain, the activity of the insular cortex occurred in response to lumbar compression stimulation. In the macaque model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, activation of the insular cortex also occurred in response to cold stimuli. As a result of evaluating pregabalin, duloxetine and tramadol, only duloxetine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the macaque model of postoperative pain, activation of the insula cortex was mainly activated by pressure stimulation. As a result of evaluating morphine, pregabalin and diclofenac, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to postoperative pain. However, macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis exhibited a pain response against pressure stimuli to the abdomen, and had activation of the thalamus. As a result of evaluating morphine, meloxicam and acetaminophen, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of thalamus due to abdominal pain from endometriosis. It was suggested that the brain activation regions could change due to various conditions that can cause the pain, as the acute pain increased activation in the insula cortex and the chronic pain increased activation in the thalamus. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fMRI as a pain biomarker, and fMRI analysis using the macaques might provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. Therefore, these study will contribute to the development of new analgesics for each pain as well as to the progress in the areas of brain research.",Thalamus; Insula cortex; Nonhuman primate; Brain activation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; LOW-BACK-PAIN

Although its anatomy is well known, in particular thanks to studies in non-human primates, its role in perception and cognition remains poorly understood. Here, we used resting-state functional connectivity from a large sample of high-resolution data provided by the Human Connectome Project, combined with a large-scale meta-analysis approach to segregate and characterize the functional organization of the pulvinar nucleus. We identified five clusters per pulvinar with distinct connectivity profiles and determined their respective coactivation patterns. Using the Neurosynth database, we then investigated the functional significance of these co-activation networks. Our results confirm the functional heterogeneity of the pulvinar, revealing clearcut differences across clusters in terms of their connectivity patterns and associated cognitive domains. While the anterior and lateral clusters appear to be involved in action and attention domains, the ventromedial and dorsomedial clusters may preferentially subserve emotional processes and saliency detection. In contrast, the inferior cluster shows less specificity but correlates with perception and memory processes. Collectively, our results suggest that the pulvinar underwrites different components of cognition, supporting a central role in the coordination of cortico-subcortical processes mediated by distributed brain networks.",Pulvinar; Thalamo-cortical circuit; Connectivity; Parcellation; Meta-analysis; RESTING-STATE FMRI; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; INFERIOR PULVINAR; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; PARCELLATION; INFORMATION

Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative image analysis was used to measure mRNAs coding for CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and thalamic center median-subfascicular complex (CM-Sf). Then, CRH neurons in the PVN were immunostained and the area of immunostaining was measured. Also, CRH fibers were immunostained in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the area of immunostaining was obtained. Finally, POMC mRNA expression was characterized in the hypothalamic infundibular nucleus. The groups were compared with ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keul's (SNK) post hoc comparison. Results: CRH mRNA was significantly elevated in the caudal PVN in the MSR and SS animals compared to HSR animals (p < 0.05, SNK). There was a significant increase in average and total CRH-positive area in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). There was also a significant increase in CRH volume in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the CM-Sf, the average CRH optical density was significantly higher in the MSR and SS groups than in the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the central nucleus of the amygdala, the area of CRH fiber staining was significantly higher in the SS group than in the MSR or HSR groups (p < 0.05, SNK). There was no difference between the groups in POMC mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Conclusion: Macaques that exhibit immediate suppression of reproductive function upon stress are considered stress sensitive. These animals have elevated CRH in the hypothalamus and limbic structures, which may play a role in suppressing the hypothalamic-gonadal axis upon stress initiation. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

The analyses herein tested whether abnormalities of volumes of brain structures forming nodes of these separate feed-forward and feedback systems are selectively related to each other and whether any of these noncortical regions can account for cognitive and motor deficits occurring as sequelae of chronic alcoholism. Methods: Regional brain measures originated from our prior neuroimaging studies, showing in alcoholics significant volume deficits in the principal structures of interest: cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, pons, and thalamus as well as prefrontal, frontal, and parietal cortex. Neuropsychological functions targeted for analysis-problem solving, visuospatial ability, and static postural stability-showed 0.6 to 1.6 SD deficits in these alcoholic men. Results: In alcoholics, the patterns of correlations were consistent with dissociation of thalamic and pontine circuitry. Pontine and thalamic volumes were not correlated with each other. Pontine volumes correlated with white matter volumes of anterior superior vermis and gray and white matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres but not with cortical regional volumes. Thalamic volumes correlated with gray matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres, parietal cortex, and inferior posterior vermian lobule, which itself correlated with parietal, prefrontal, and frontal cortical volumes. Controls did not show these correlational patterns. Brain structure-function relationships in alcoholics examined with multiple regression identified anterior vermian but not prefrontal or parietal volume as a unique predictor of balance scores; vermian and thalamic but not prefrontal cortical volumes as predictors of card sorting scores; and cerebellar hemispheric white matter but not parietal cortical volume as a predictor of visuospatial ability. Conclusions: Each major node of frontocerebellar circuitry shows volume deficits in alcoholics but can be independently compromised. Disruption of these circuits may underlie alcohol ism-related neuropsychological deficits, either by abnormalities present in individual nodes or by disconnection via interruption of selective circuitry.",cerebellum; frontal lobes; alcohol; brain circuit; thalamus; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; CENTRAL PONTINE MYELINOLYSIS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICAL GRAY-MATTER; CEREBELLAR VERMIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; WHITE-MATTER; ABSTINENT ALCOHOLICS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; MAMMILLARY BODY

The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long-Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to determine the degree of labeled overlap in both of these subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from the vibrissal representation in MI were more extensive than corresponding projections from SI. Both cortical areas sent dense projections to the dorsolateral neostriatum, but the MI vibrissal representation also projected to regions located more rostrally and medially. Despite these differences, both MI and Sl projected to overlapping parts of the dorsolateral neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the medial sector of the posterior complex of the thalamus (POm). Because POm is somatotopically organized and has reciprocal. connections with both Sl and MI cortices, the amount of labeled overlap in POm was used to indicate whether the tracers were injected into corresponding whisker representations of MI and SI. We found that the proportion of labeled overlap in the neostriatum was highly correlated with the amount of labeled overlap in POm. These results indicate that the rodent neostriatum receives convergent projections from corresponding regions in MI and SI cortex. Furthermore, the thalamocortical projections of the POm indicate that it may modulate corticostriatal outputs from corresponding representations in MI and SI.

Despite the systemic impact of hypoxia-ischaemia, the resulting brain damage was previously reported to be largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are, therefore also at risk of injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. Here, we report a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11-35 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic (AMT) segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, the diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit. (C) 2016 The Authors.

NR3A is a recently identified unique modulatory subunit that decreases NMDA receptor current and calcium influx. In rodents, NR3A is developmentally expressed, displaying robust expression early in development that declines with age, reaching low levels in the adult brain. A distinct and highly selective pattern of expression is observed in the developing and mature rodent brain, suggesting that NR3A may play a very specific role in NMDA receptor-mediated processes. NR3A expression in other species, however, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the expression of NR3A mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain. Our results indicate that NR3A mRNA is expressed throughout much of the adult primate brain, and at high levels in specific brain regions including the neocortex, substantia nigra par compacta and cerebellum, as well as select areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and hypothamalamus. Western blot analysis reflects that this protein is translated and expressed in multiple brain regions. In contrast to the rat mRNA, our results suggest that NR3A transcript is widely expressed in the adult primate brain. Particular enrichment in some brain areas may reflect brain-region or circuit-specific functions for this NMDA receptor subunit. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo images were acquired with proton-density, T-1 and T-2(*) weightings. Five GE images with increased susceptibility effects were generated using a GESFID sequence, from which T-2* maps were also reconstructed. The first echo of the GESFID sequence (TE = 12.6 ms) produced the best contrast-to-noise ratio (CIN) between the pallidium and the putamen, the pallidium and the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the surrounding white matter, and the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. An increased T-2*-weighting (TE = 37.2 ms) was necessary to maximize C/N between the putamen and the surrounding white matter, and between the subthalamic nucleus and the surrounding white matter. A dual GE sequence with a short TE ( approximate to 10 ms) and a longer one (approximate to 30 ms) thus effectively localizes basal ganglia subregions at 4.7 T. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We provide histological descriptions of the major sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the superior colliculus (SC) of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus has the six layers typical of strepsirrhine primates, with matching pairs of magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers, one of each pair for each eye. Unlike most primates, magnocellular and parvocellular layers exhibit only small differences in cell size. All layers express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), reflecting terminations of retinal inputs, and the expression of VGLUT2 is much less dense in the koniocellular layers. Parvalbumin is densely expressed in all layers, while SMI-32 is densely expressed only in the magnocellular layers. The adjoining pulvinar complex has a posterior nucleus with strong VGLUT2 expression, reflecting terminations from the SC. The SC is laminated with dense expression of VGLUT2 in the upper superficial gray layer, reflecting terminations from the retina. The ventral (MGNv), medial, and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate complex are only moderately differentiated, although patches of dense VGLUT2 expression are found along the outer border of MGNv. The ventroposterior nucleus has darkly stained cells in Nissl stained sections, and narrow septa separating patchy regions of dense VGLUT2 expression that likely represent different body parts. Overall, these structures resemble those in other strepsirrhine primates, although they are smaller, with the sensory nuclei appearing to occupy proportionately more of the dorsal thalamus than in larger primates.",lateral geniculate nucleus; medial geniculate nucleus; primates; prosimian; pulvinar; >; strepsirrhine; ventroposterior nucleus; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; PROSIMIAN PRIMATE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; GALAGO

A key parameter that the nervous system regulates is the level of force to exert against an object during tasks such as grasping. Previous studies indicate that the basal ganglia do not exhibit increased activity with increasing amplitude of force, although these conclusions are based mainly on the putamen. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which regions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex display increased activity when producing pinch-grip contractions of increasing force amplitude. We found that the internal portion of the globus pallidus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) had a positive increase in percent signal change with increasing force, whereas the external portion of the globus pallidus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, and caudate did not. In the thalamus we found that the ventral thalamic regions increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude. The contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor/somatosensory (M1/S1) cortices had a positive increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude, and the contralateral M1/S1 had a greater increase in percent signal change and activation volume than the ipsilateral side. We also found that deactivation did not change across force in the motor cortex and basal ganglia, but that the ipsilateral M1/S1 had greater deactivation than the contralateral M1/S1. Our findings provide direct evidence that GPi and STN regulate the amplitude of force output. These findings emphasize the heterogeneous role of individual nuclei of the basal ganglia in regulating specific parameters of motor output.",nan; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; THALAMIC INPUTS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; ISOMETRIC FORCE; MACAQUE MONKEYS

Both ligands were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 via nucleophilic displacement of the corresponding 2-chloropyridine precursor with [F-18] potassium fluoride. [F-18]MK-1312 was found to have a suitable signal for quantification of mGluR1 receptors in nonhuman primates and was more thoroughly characterized. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-1312 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the known distribution of mGluR1, with the highest uptake in the cerebellum, moderate uptake in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortical regions, and lowest uptake in the caudate and putamen. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human cerebellum homogenates confirmed that [F-18]MK-1312 binds to a single site with a Bmax/Kd ratio of 132 and 98, respectively. PET studies in rhesus monkey with [F-18]MK-1312 showed high brain uptake and a regional distribution consistent with in vitro autoradiography results. Blockade of [F-18]MK-1312 uptake with mGluR1 allosteric antagonist MK-5435 dose-dependently reduced tracer uptake in all regions of gray matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake. This revealed a large specific signal useful for determination of mGluR1 receptor occupancy in rhesus monkey.

Evidence for more direct sensorimotor links is now presented to show that cerebral cortex rarely, if ever, receives messages representing receptor activity only; thalamic inputs to cortex also carry copies of current motor instructions. Pathways afferent to the thalamus represent the primary input to neocortex. Generally they are made up of branching axons that send one branch to the thalamus and another to output centers of the brain stem or spinal cord. The information transmitted through the classical sensory pathways to the thalamus represents not only information about the environment and the body, but also about instructions currently on their way to motor centers. The proposed hierarchy of direct corticocortical connections of the sensory pathways is not the only possible hierarchy of cortical connections. There is also a hierarchy of the corticofugal pathways to motor centers in the midbrain, and there are transthalamic corticocortical pathways that may show a comparable hierarchy. The extent to which these hierarchies may match each other, and relate to early developmental changes are poorly defined at present, but are important for understanding mechanisms that can link action and perception in the developing brain.",nan; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RETICULARIS TEGMENTI PONTIS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION

Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the medial pulvinar, however, reveal retrogradely filled neurons up to 2.0 mm from the injection edge. Serial section reconstruction (n = 18) confirmed that retrogradely filled neurons projected to the injection site and showed that they had additional long-range collaterals within the posterior pulvinar. Arrays of small, beaded terminations occurred in multiple foci along the collaterals. Terminal arrays were up to 1.0 mm in length; foci were separated by about 0.7 mm. Somata were large (average area = 220 mu m(2)), and dendritic arbors were radiate and also large (about 1.0 mm in diameter), but without either the appendages of classical interneurons or the hairlike spines characteristic of radiate pulvinocortical projection neurons. Double labeling for BDA and parvalbumin (PV) or BDA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) indicated that these large neurons were positive for both PV and GABA. Double labeling for PV and GABA, or PV and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) revealed a small number of similarly large neurons in the posterior pulvinar that were positive for both substances. Thus, we propose that these neurons are a novel class of inhibitory interneuron, longer range than the classic thalamic local circuit interneurons. Future questions include how these neurons relate to other inhibitory systems and specific postsynaptic populations and whether they are located preferentially within the posterior pulvinar, possibly related to the multimodal character of this thalamic region.",axon collaterals; biotinylated dextran amine; divergence; inhibition; intrathalamic; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; INFERIOR PULVINAR; THALAMIC NUCLEI; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE HISTOCHEMISTRY; NEUROCHEMICAL SUBDIVISIONS; ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS; ANTEROGRADE TRACER; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS

We correlated changes in PV and Cal staining patterns with the well-documented developmental sequence for primate striate cortex neuron generation and maturation, synaptogenesis, and thalamocortical axon interactions in an attempt to deduce a functional role for these proteins. Our major finding is that Cal and PV have diametrically opposed developmental patterns except in layer 1. At F60 days both are present only in neurons of layer 1 and the number of labeled cell bodies and processes increases up to F125 days. Almost all Cal+ and PV+ cells in layer 1 disappear by P12 weeks. Cal is present by F113 days in pyramidal and stellate neurons, particularly layers 4-6. The number and staining density of cells in layers 2-6 increases up to birth and then both decline by P9-12 weeks. Supragranular layers show a second increase in Cal labeling from P20-36 weeks, and then there is a slow decline to the adult pattern which is reached by P1-2 years. Cell bodies in layers 4A, 4C-alpha, and deep 4C-beta are heavily Cal+ during pre-and early post-natal periods, but upper 4C-beta remains unlabeled. PV is not seen until F155-162 days in layers 2-6. Large stellate and a few pyramidal cells appear first in layers 5/6 and 4C-alpha, but PV+ cell stellate neurons are found in all layers except 4C-beta by P6 weeks. Layer 4C-beta contains a few PV+ cell bodies at P3 weeks, and light neuropile 4C-beta exceeds that of 4C-alpha. Striate cortex has an adult pattern of cell number and neuropile density by P20 weeks. These developmental patterns suggest that the highest density of Cal cell body staining does not correlate with synaptogenesis, or the postnatal critical period of visually driven, binocular interactions. Rather Cal appears when lateral geniculate axons arrive in cortex, persists over the entire span of thalamocortical interactions, and disappears during the decline of cortical plasticity. The appearance of PV is highly correlated with the onset of complex visually driven activity at birth, while both the number of PV+ cell bodies and the density of PV+ neuropile reach adult levels coincident with the completion of thalamocortical connections.",IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; VISION; MACAQUE; CALCIUM; nan

We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV ofMacaca fascicularisandmulattamonkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with smallen passantboutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod.

Design: EEG, EMG, and EOG were recorded continuously via implanted telemetry from 5 unrestrained male rhesus monkeys housed individually under a 16:8 light-dark cycle (LD 16:8; L = 13 lux; D = 0 lux). Results: In a LID 16:8 cycle, all 5 monkeys demonstrated a long period of consolidated sleep during the 8-h dark period. On average, sleep accounted for 89.2% of the 8-h dark period and 25.2% of the 16-hour light period. REM sleep occupied 23% of total sleep time over 24 h, or 10.7% of the total time. The average length of the consolidated sleep (CS) period was 10.5 h, although the time of CS onset was variable. In contrast, the end of CS, and thus the onset of consolidated wakefulness (CW) demonstrated very little variation, typically occurring within 2 min of light onset. Ultradian NREM-REM cycles with periods of approximately 60 min were also observed. EEG delta activity during NREM sleep, thought to reflect the homeostatic sleep process, peaked at 3-4 h after CS onset. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of longterm, unrestrained sleep monitoring in nonhuman primates using fully-implantable biotelemetry. With minor exceptions, most notably a delay in peak delta activity, sleep-wake architecture, regulation, and consolidation in rhesus monkeys strongly resembles that of humans. These results demonstrate that the unrestrained rhesus monkey is an excellent biomedical model for human sleep.",NREM; nonhuman primate; telemetry; EEG; slow wave activity; REM; EEG POWER-DENSITY; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; INTERNIGHT RELIABILITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; NOCTURNAL SLEEP; YOUNG-ADULTS

As a result of this reorganization, intact inputs from the face expand into the deafferented hand representations. Dorsal column injuries also result in permanent deficits in the use of digits for precision grip and a loss of fractionated movements of the digits. We determined whether the chronic loss of sensory inputs and the behavioral deficits caused by lesions of the dorsal columns in adult macaque monkeys affect organization of the motor cortex. The results show that, in the primary motor cortex, intracortical microstimulation evokes extension-flexion movements of the thumb at significantly fewer sites compared with the normal monkeys. There is a corresponding increase in the adduction-abduction movements. Furthermore, there is a significant increase in the thresholds of the currents required to evoke movements of the digits. Thus, long-term sensory loss in adult monkeys does not change the overall topography of the movement representation in the motor cortex but results in changes in the details of movement representations.",nan; DORSAL COLUMN LESIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FASCICULUS-CUNEATUS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS

Recent electrophysiological reports suggest that while initial propofol infusion provokes an increase in fast rhythms (from beta to gamma range), slow activity (from delta to alpha range) rises selectively during loss of consciousness. Dynamic causal modeling was used to investigate the neural mechanisms mediating these changes in spectral power in humans. We analyzed source-reconstructed data from frontal and parietal cortices during normal wakefulness, propofol-induced mild sedation, and loss of consciousness. Bayesian model selection revealed that the best model for explaining spectral changes across the three states involved changes in corticothalamic interactions. Compared with wakefulness, mild sedation was accounted for by an increase in thalamic excitability, which did not further increase during loss of consciousness. In contrast, loss of consciousness per se was accompanied by a decrease in backward corticocortical connectivity from frontal to parietal cortices, while thalamocortical connectivity remained unchanged. These results emphasize the importance of recurrent corticocortical communication in the maintenance of consciousness and suggest a direct effect of propofol on cortical dynamics.",nan; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; NEURAL MASS MODEL; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; VEGETATIVE STATE; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; NEURONAL PATHWAYS; DEFAULT NETWORK; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX

Here we describe responses of macaque PIVC neurons to three-dimensional (3D) vestibular and optic flow stimulation. We found robust vestibular responses to both translational and rotational stimuli in the retroinsular (Ri) and adjacent secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. PIVC neurons did not respond to optic flow stimulation, and vestibular responses were similar in darkness and during visual fixation. Cells in the upper bank and tip of the lateral sulcus (Ri and S2) responded to sinusoidal vestibular stimuli with modulation at the first harmonic frequency and were directionally tuned. Cells in the lower bank of the lateral sulcus (mostly Ri) often modulated at the second harmonic frequency and showed either bimodal spatial tuning or no tuning at all. All directions of 3D motion were represented in PIVC, with direction preferences distributed approximately uniformly for translation, but showing a preference for roll rotation. Spatiotemporal profiles of responses to translation revealed that half of PIVC cells followed the linear velocity profile of the stimulus, one-quarter carried signals related to linear acceleration (in the form of two peaks of direction selectivity separated in time), and a few neurons followed the derivative of linear acceleration (jerk). In contrast, mainly velocity-coding cells were found in response to rotation. Thus, PIVC comprises a large functional region in macaque areas Ri and S2, with robust responses to 3D rotation and translation, but is unlikely to play a significant role in visual/vestibular integration for self-motion perception.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; OPTOKINETIC AFTER-NYSTAGMUS; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; ALERT MONKEY; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; THALAMUS NEURONS

In the same animals, neuroanatomical tracers were placed into electrophysiologically identified sites in PV and/or the second somatosensory area (S2). Foci of anterograde and retrograde label were related to electrophysiological maps of cortical areas and cortical and thalamic architecture. The results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Multiunit recordings from cortex on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus demonstrate that PV is somatotopically organized, with the face representation adjoining area 3b and the hindlimb and tail representations away from this border in cortex deep on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus. The forelimb representation is caudal in PV adjacent to the S2 forelimb representation. The body surface representation in PV approximates a mirror image of that in S2; (2) Areas PV and S2 are less myelinated and have less cytochrome oxidase enzyme activity than area 3b; (3) The ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI) of the thalamus provides the major somatosensory projections to PV. PV is reciprocally connected with VPI and anterior pulvinar; (4) PV has ipsilateral cortical connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, and M1 and higher order somatosensory fields, and at least most of these connections are somatotopically matched; and (5) Callosal connections of PV are with S2 and PV of the other cerebral hemisphere.

For example, many nuclei in the human thalamus, with projections to the cerebral cortex, contain a large number of neurons with intense BuChE activity. Thalamocortical projections subserve a variety of cognitive functions. Due to genetic mutations, there are individuals who do not have detectable BuChE activity (silent BuChE). While the prevalence of silent BuChE is only 1:100,000 in European and American populations, it is 1:24 in the Vysya community in Coimbatore, India. To examine whether there are differences in cognitive functions between individuals with silent BuChE and those expressing normal BuChE (wild-type), twelve healthy individuals with silent BuChE and thirteen healthy individuals with wildtype BuChE, all from the Vysya community in Coimbatore, were tested for cognitive function using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics test battery. The silent BuChE group was slightly faster on simple reaction tasks, but slower on a visual perceptual matching task. Furthermore, discriminant function analyses correctly classified 11/12 silent and 8/13 wild-type BuChE subjects (76% correct classification overall) based on BuChE status. Different profiles of cognitive test performance between individuals with silent and wild-type BuChE were observed.

In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a 'fast lane' reserved to highspeed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.

In the developing animal brain, including those of non-human primates (NHPs), anaesthetics induce apoptotic cell death. We previously reported that a 5h isoflurane (ISO) exposure in infant NHPs increases apoptosis 13-fold compared with control animals. However, the majority of paediatric surgeries requiring anaesthesia are of shorter durations. We examined whether 3 h ISO exposure similarly increases neuroapoptosis in the NHP developing brain. Methods: Six-day-old NHP infants (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to 3h of a surgical plane of ISO (n = 6) or to room air (n = 5). Following exposure, NHP brains were screened for neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis using activated caspase-3 immunolabelling and unbiased stereology. Results: ISO treatment increased apoptosis (neurones + oligodendrocyte) to greater than four times that in the control group [mean density of apoptotic profiles: 57 (SD 22) mm(-3) vs 14 (SD 5.2) mm(-3), respectively]. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis was evenly distributed throughout the white matter whereas neuroapoptosis occurred primarily in the cortex (all regions), caudate, putamen and thalamus. Conclusions: A 3 h exposure to ISO is sufficient to induce widespread neurotoxicity in the developing primate brain. These results are relevant for clinical medicine, as many surgical and diagnostic procedures in children require anaesthesia durations similar to those modelled here.

Migration of layer IV neurons into the cortical plate just precedes thalamocortical invasion, suggesting that these neurons could cue or tropically direct thalamic ingrowth, To explore the interactions of layer IV neurons and their thalamocortical input, we administered a mitotic inhibitor methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) intraperitoneally to timed pregnant hamsters on E14 when layer IV neurons are normally being generated in striate cortex. Reduced numbers of cortical neurons overall, the absence of small-diameter granule neurons, and the absence of the zone of reduced density of callosally projecting neurons suggest that neither the depletion of layer IV cells in the ventricular zone nor thalamic afferents in the subplate or cortical plate respecify the later generated cohort of neurons (presumptive layer II/III neurons) to acquire morphological and connectional properties of layer IV. Dil injections into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) of animals from embryonic (E15) and postnatal (P7) ages shaw that the final position of thalamic axons with respect to layer V is not affected by the absence of E14 neurons. In the normal visual cortex, geniculocortical axons have begun their arborization in their presumptive target layer in the upper cortex immediately below the undifferentiated cortical plate on P4, while in MAM animals, this process occurs 1 d later. The extent and density of arborization is much reduced in the thinner cortex of the MAM animals. We thus find no evidence for instruction of migrating neurons by thalamocortical areas to assume the layer IV phenotype; if instruction does occur it must take place in a very restricted time window. Thalamic axons can also find their laminar position in the absence of cells of this phonotype.",nan; MAMMALIAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LARVAL FROG RETINA; GOLDEN-HAMSTER; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; NEUROTOXIC DESTRUCTION; TERMINAL ARBORS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ADULT-RAT

However, the actual function of these large nuclei of the thalamus remains unknown. In contrast to the nearby lateral geniculate nucleus, the LP-P complex does not receive any substantial direct projections from the retina. Its main visual inputs come from the mesencephalon and the neocortex. Most cells in the LP-P complex behave like cortical units. They are tuned to the orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies of the visual stimulus. In addition, most units are binocular and sensitive to relative retinal disparity. Despite their multiple inputs, the LP-P complex cells form an homogeneous population and their overall properties do not reflect those of a given cortical or subcortical area. On the basis of its afferent and efferent connectivity, it has been proposed that the LP-P complex may serve as a relay of an extrageniculate ascendant pathway which originates from the superior colliculus, and/or provide another route for the geniculo-striate input to reach the extrastriate areas. Despite the fact that there is some electro-physiological evidence of such functions, it is now often suggested that the LP-P complex may integrate its multiple inputs and be involved in functions which go beyond those of a simple thalamic relay.

The molecular weight of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the homogenate of spinal cord was 25 KDa, 30 KDa, and 34 KDa, respectively. Immunolabeling revealed GDNF was ubiquitously distributed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, basal nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. TGF-beta 1 was least distributed and found only in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and PDGF-BB expression was also limited and present only in the brainstem and spinal cord. Besides, TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF were localized in the astrocytes and microglia of spinal cord and hippocampus, and their expression was mainly found in the cytoplasm and primary dendrites. The mRNA of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was localized to neuronal subpopulations in the spinal cord and cerebellum. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1, GDNF and PDGF-BB may be associated with neuronal survival, neural regeneration and functional recovery in the CNS of adult rhesus macaques, providing the potential insights into the development or refinement of therapies based on these factors.",Transforming growth factor beta1; Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; Platelet-derived growth factor-BB; Rhesus macaque; Cellular distribution; GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR GDNF; FACTOR MESSENGER-RNA; TGF-BETA; SPINAL-CORD; PROGENITOR CELLS; TRANSFORMING GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA-1; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA

Results have revealed that (1) the forelimb is represented predominantly in the PMdr, while only a few sites representing other body parts are distributed as embedded within the forelimb representation; (2) the corticostriatal input zone is located in the striatal cell bridges and their surroundings; (3) the cells of origin of the thalamocortical projections to the PMdr are located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus, the oral divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, area X, the caudal divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the intralaminar nuclear group; (4) the PMdr is interconnected primarily with higher-order motor-related areas and dorsal area 46. These data indicate that the input-output pattern of the PMdr resembles those of the presupplementary motor area and the rostral cingulate motor area, and that the PMdr may play critical roles in higher-order motor functions.

Cell bodies were described from Nissl material. Golgi-impregnated dendritic arborizations were reconstructed from serial sections and digitized in three dimensions by computer-assisted microscopy. The central complex was subdivided into three parts on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and hodological criteria: pars parafascicularis (medial), pars media (intermediate), and pars paralateralis (lateral). The mean cross-sectional areas of cell bodies were identical (181 mum2) in the three parts in macaques. In humans they were larger in the pars parafascicularis (304 mum2) than in the other parts (248 and 240 mum2). Small local circuit neurons were found throughout the complex. Large projection neurons differed statistically in the three parts. In macaques, pars parafascicularis neurons had few dendritic stems and tips (3-11) and a short total dendritic length (2,000 mum). Pars paralateralis neurons had more ramified (5-60) and longer (5,800 mum) dendrites. They bore numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons had intermediate characteristics (5-9; 2,400 mum). In humans, pars parafascicular neurons had similar topological characteristics (3-12) but longer dendrites (3,000 mum) than in the monkey. Pars paralateralis neurons had more branched (6-71) and longer (9,000 mum) dendrites, with more numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons also had intermediate characteristics (4-25; 3,800 mum). The present study supports a tripartite subdivision of the primate central complex and demonstrates significant interspecies differences.

The motor circuits within the striato-pallidal complex are thought to facilitate desired movement and inhibit unwanted movement through their influence via thalamus, mainly on precentral motor cortical regions. Lesions in the motor thalamus, or in the globus pallidus, therefore might be expected to impair voluntary movement. But stereotaxic lesions in patients with Parkinson's disease directed at the motor thalamus verified at autopsy, and lesions in the globus pallidus, which improve rigidity and tremor apparently do not worsen parkinsonian hypokinesia and bradykinesia; nor do they regularly cause dyskinesias. Reasons for this discrepancy are reviewed. It is concluded that the motor circuits of the basal ganglia are part of a distributed motor system which can operate, albeit imperfectly, in the absence of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical feedback. There may, however be subtle defects in motor performance after thalamic and pallidal lesions which have escaped attention. Further consideration leads to two hypotheses concerning normal basal ganglia motor function. First it seems most likely that it is a pause in firing of medial pallidal and substantia nigra reticulata neurons that by disinhibition of thalamic targets, permits movements generated by cortical motor areas. An increase in firing of medial pallidal neurons, which so far has been the major focus of attention, may be more concerned with inhibition of unwanted movement. Secondly, we suggest that the basal ganglia play a particular role in motor control. A change in firing of medial pallidal neurons appears to occur too late to initiate a new movement. However the motor circuit within the striato-pallidal system routinely receives a continuous delayed read-out of cortical motor activity and issues an output directed via thalamus mainly to premotor cortical regions. This may permit the routine automatic execution of sequences of movements generated in cortical motor areas. There is evidence that other regions of the striatum respond to significant external or internal cues as dictated by their cortical inputs, the significance being determined by memory, novelty, emotional and other contexts. We suggest that such events capture the attention of the non-motor striatum, which then interrupts the routine operation of the motor circuit, perhaps at the level of the medial pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata, to permit new cortical motor action.",BASAL GANGLIA FUNCTION; STEREOTAXIC SURGERY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; PRIMATE GLOBUS PALLIDUS; MONKEY CAUDATE NEURONS; SINGLE CELL DISCHARGE; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; OCULOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BEHAVING MONKEY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

Retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected in different loci of the parietal cortex. Injected areas were verified cytoarchitectonically and confirmed by analyzing the retrograde thalamic labeling pattern obtained. Anterograde fluorescent tracers were placed in the intermediate and lateral deep cerebellar nuclei. The topographical overlap between cerebellar terminals and parietal-projecting thalamic neurons was analyzed. In the central lateral (CL) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei, cells projecting to anterior somatosensory (S1) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortices were demonstrated to receive direct cerebellar input. In particular, two patterns of organization were revealed. In CL, the PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, both receiving cerebellar fibers, were intermingled. In VL, PPC, and S1-projecting neurons were instead segregated, and the areas containing labeled neurons received separate contingents of cerebellar fibers. These patterns suggest that in CL axons originating from the same or neighboring cerebellar neurons can terminate on both PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, while in VL cerebellar information is funneled to S1 and PPC through two segregated parallel pathways. The significance of the observed organization is discussed comparing findings in other species and in relation with electrophysiological and functional studies on cerebelloparietal interrelationships.

Here we show that endogenous neural precursors can be induced in situ to differentiate into mature neurons, in regions of adult mammalian neocortex that do not normally undergo any neurogenesis. This differentiation occurs in a layer- and region-specific manner, and the neurons can re-form appropriate corticothalamic connections. We induced synchronous apoptotic degeneration(7,8) of corticothalamic neurons in layer VI of anterior cortex of adult mice and examined the fates of dividing cells within cortex, using markers for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) and progressive neuronal differentiation. Newly made, BrdU-positive cells expressed NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, in regions of cortex undergoing targeted neuronal death and survived for at least 28 weeks. Subsets of BrdU+ precursors expressed Doublecortin, a protein found exclusively in migrating neurons(9,10), and Hu, an early neuronal marker(11,12). Retrograde labelling from thalamus demonstrated that BrdU+ neurons can form long-distance corticothalamic connections. Our results indicate that neuronal replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury may be possible through manipulation of endogenous neural precursors in situ.",nan; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; NEURAL STEM-CELLS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; MAMMALIAN FOREBRAIN; EMBRYONIC NEURONS; GENERATED NEURONS; GROWTH-FACTOR; MOUSE BRAIN; RAT; MIGRATION

This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described.

Lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at cervical levels in monkeys result in expansion of the intact chin inputs into the deafferented hand representation in area 3b, second somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas of the somatosensory cortex, ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus, and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. Here, we describe the extent and nature of reorganization of the cuneate and gracile nuclei of adult macaque monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns, and compare it with the reorganization of area 3b in the same monkeys. In both, area 3b and the cuneate nucleus chin inputs expand to reactivate the deafferented neurons. However, unlike area 3b, neurons in the cuneate nucleus also acquire receptive fields on the shoulder, neck, and occiput. A comparison with the previously published results shows that reorganization in the cuneate nucleus is similar to that in VPL. Thus, the emergent topography following deafferentations by spinal cord injuries undergoes transformation as the reorganized inputs ascend from subcortical nuclei to area 3b.

Several brain imaging studies among patients with CPSP demonstrate that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this condition is the maladaptive plasticity of pain-related brain regions. However, the temporal profile of the regional plastic changes, as suggested by brain imaging of CPSP patients, as well as their cellular basis, is unknown. To investigate these issues, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical analysis with our established CPSP monkey model. From 8 weeks after a hemorrhagic lesion to the unilateral ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the monkeys exhibited significant behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting allodynia. The present VBM results revealed a decrease in gray matter volume in the pain-related areas after several weeks following the lesion. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining in the ipsilesional posterior insular cortex (ipsi-PIC) and secondary somatosensory cortex (ipsi-SII), where the significant reduction in gray matter volume was observed in the VBM result, displayed a significant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals compared to intact monkeys. Our results suggest that progressive changes in neuronal morphology, including synaptic loss in the ipsi-PIC/SII, are involved in the CPSP.",allodynia; chronic pain; insular cortex; macaque; thalamic syndrome; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RECEPTOR-BINDING; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; INTERNEURONS; STIMULATION; RESPONSES

Area GrFO displays strong connections with areas DO, PrCO, and ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPF) area 12l, and even more with the mostly hand-related ventral premotor (PMv) area F5a. Other connections involve the mostly face/mouth-related PMv area F5c, the arm-related area F6/pre-SMA, the hand-related fields of VLPF areas 46v and 12r, and area SII, mostly the hand representation. Furthermore, area GrFO shows rich connectivity with several components of the limbic system including orbitofrontal areas 12o, 12m, and 11, the agranular and dysgranular insula, the agranular cingulate area 24, and the amygdala. Thalamic afferents originate primarily from the parvocellular and the magnocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus and from midline and intralaminar nuclei. This connectivity pattern clearly distinguishes area GrFO from areas DO and PrCO, characterized by a connectivity mostly involving oral sensorimotor and gustatory areas/subcortical structures. The present data suggest, based on connectivity patterns, an involvement of area GrFO in the cortical circuits for controlling goal-directed hand and face/mouth actions. In this context, area GrFO could represent a gateway for the access of limbic inputs, for example about subjective values, emotional significance of stimuli or internal states, to the PMv areas involved in selecting appropriate goal-directed hand and mouth/face actions.",Hand motor control; Limbic system; Gustatory cortex; Premotor cortex; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL LARYNX AREA; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBJECTIVE VALUE

To study this role, a clearer understanding of pregeniculate organization is required. Based on its connectivity and neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that this nucleus is composed of several subnuclei, suggesting the term, pregeniculate complex (PrGC). The PrGC includes a weakly developed dorsal lamina, rostrally, and a well-developed ventral lamina. The ventral lamina includes the retinorecipient and superior sublayers, rostrally, and the medial division, caudally. A thin lamina of cells lateral to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is contiguous with the PrGC; we term this the lateral division. The PrGC and the lateral division each project to the SC/NOT; the superior sublayer and medial division of the PrGC are connected reciprocally to the SC/NOT. Immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and substance P (SP) further delineate the PrGC subnuclei. The retinorecipient sublayer stains most intensely for GABA and SP. The superior sublayer and medial division also stain strongly for GABA and SP. Essentially all neurons in the lateral division are GABA-positive. The combination of tract tracing and immunocytochemistry demonstrate differences in the connectivity of the PrGC subnuclei and the lateral division with the SC/NOT. This, combined with the differential localization of GABA in the PrGC, provides a basis for further study of its functional role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Under standardized conditions and polysomnographic control, the patients underwent repeated 24-hour study sessions covering the entire clinical course of the disease. Hormones were assayed at 30-min intervals. Four healthy volunteers were used as controls. A sleep/wake cycle was always absent in fatal familial insomnia. Serum somatotropin and prolactin concentrations never exceeded the normal range of variation. The nocturnal elevation of somatotropin disappeared simultaneously with sleep loss, whereas a significant 24-hour component of variations in serum prolactin levels was present for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle, with normally placed nocturnal acrophases. Complete obliteration of the 24-hour component was achieved for prolactin only in the advanced stages, through a progressive decrease in 24-hour amplitude of variation. Selective and progressive degeneration of the mediodorsal and anterior ventral nuclei of the thalamus causes an early obliteration of the 24-hour rhythm of somatotropin and a later disappearance of circadian prolactin rhythmicity. The persistence of a significant circadian rhythm for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle indicates that prolactin rhythmicity is not exclusively sleep-entrained.",SOMATOTROPIN; PROLACTIN; INSOMNIA; THALAMIC DISEASES; CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS; CLINICAL NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY; GROWTH-HORMONE SECRETION; SLEEP-WAKING CYCLE; PRION PROTEIN GENE; PLASMA PROLACTIN; THALAMIC NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTISOL; RELEASE; WAKEFULNESS; LESIONS

This study is focused on the second of these. In monkeys, deafferented for two years by section of the cuneate fasciculus at the C1 level, there was extensive withdrawal of axon terminals from thalamus and cortex, detectable a decade before visible atrophy of their parent neuronal somata in the cuneate nucleus or thalamus.

Donepezil, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AChEI), has been recommended as a treatment option for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to characterize the effects of donepezil on rCMRglu using FDG-PET in non-human primates. We investigated the effects of administration of donepezil (500 mu g/kg, i.m.), the non-selective muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist scopolamine (30 mu g/kg, i.m.), and the coadministration of both drugs on the rCMRglu of conscious young rhesus monkeys. Donepezil increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except in the thalamus. Scopolamine treatment also increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except the cerebellum and thalamus. However, these effects disappeared with coadministration of the drugs. This PET study showed that administration of donepezil or scopolamine alone increased the rCMRglu in conscious rhesus monkeys. We also found that the donepezil-induced increase was abolished by simultaneous administration of scopolamine, suggesting that muscarinic ACh receptor function plays an important role in the effect of donepezil.",FDG-PET; Donepezil; Scopolamine; Muscarinic ACh receptor; Rhesus monkey; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GLUCOSE METABOLIC-RATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; TREATED PATIENTS; AGED RATS; MEMORY; GALANTAMINE; HUMANS

Hitherto, experimental studies have suggested that STN-HFS reduces the activity of STN neurons. However, some recent reports have challenged this view, showing that STN-HFS might also increase the activity of globus pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons that are under strong excitatory drive of the STN. In addition, most results emanate from studies applying acute STN-HFS, while parkinsonian patients receive chronic stimulation. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the effect of chronic (10 days) STN-HFS in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated nonhuman primate. For this purpose, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, a measure of global synaptic activity, was assessed in the basal ganglia and the motor thalamus after chronic unilateral STN-HFS. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mRNA expression, a marker of efferent metabolic activity, was additionally assessed in the globus pallidus. Chronic STN-HFS (i) reversed abnormally decreased 2-DG uptake in the STN of parkinsonian nonhuman primates, (ii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG accumulation in the GPi while COI mRNA expression was increased, suggesting global activation of GPi neurons, and (iii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG uptake in the ventrolateral motor thalamus nucleus. The simultaneous decrease in 2-DG uptake and increase in COI mRNA expression are difficult to reconcile with the current model of basal ganglia function and suggest that the mechanisms by which STN-HFS exerts its clinical benefits are more complex than a simple reversal of abnormal activity in the STN and its targets.",basal ganglia; deep brain stimulation; globus pallidus internalis; motor thalamus; STN; subthalamic nucleus; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; MPTP-INDUCED PARKINSONISM; INDUCED CELLULAR DEFECTS; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; NUCLEUS STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION

Such changes were further examined by studying immunoreactivity for calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin, three calcium-binding proteins that mark distinct subpopulations of GABA neurons, in macaques that had been monocularly deprived by intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin. Deprivation for 5 d dr longer produced a reversal in the normal pattern of calbindin immunostaining in layer III, from one In which intense neuronal immunostaining surrounded the cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs to one in which it occupied the puffs; Over the same period, calbindin immunostaining in other layers was reduced across the entire width of deprived-eye columns or extended into flanking regions of normal-eye columns. In contrast, reduction in parvalbumin immunostaining occurred only in deprived-eye columns and included only terminals with short periods of deprivation (up to 17 d) bet both terminals and somata with longer periods. No change in calretinin immunoreactivity was observed. These findings demonstrate that GABA neurons of macaque V1 vary in their response to monocular deprivation according to their neurochemistry and position, suggesting that the weight of inputs from the two eyes and the intrinsic characteristics of each GABA population determine how a neuron responds to a change in visual input.",nan; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CALBINDIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY

In the old world monkey, such a CD circuit for saccades has been identified extending from superior colliculus through MD thalamus to frontal cortex, but there is little evidence that this circuit actually contributes to visual perception. We tested the influence of this CD circuit on visual perception by first training macaque monkeys to report their perceived eye direction, and then reversibly inactivating the CD as it passes through the thalamus. We found that the monkey's perception changed; during CD inactivation, there was a difference between where the monkey perceived its eyes to be directed and where they were actually directed. Perception and saccade were decoupled. We established that the perceived eye direction at the end of the saccade was not derived from proprioceptive input from eye muscles, and was not altered by contextual visual information. We conclude that the CD provides internal information contributing to the brain's creation of perceived visual stability. More specifically, the CD might provide the internal saccade vector used to unite separate retinal images into a stable visual scene.",corollary discharge; efference copy; FEF; macaque; MD; visual perception; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSITION INFORMATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SIGNALS SENT; TIME-COURSE; MOVEMENTS

[1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 335:73-91). Inferior temporal areas TEO and TE were injected with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and tritiated amino acids, respectively, or vice versa, in 1-week-old (N = 6) and 3-4-year-old (N = 6) Macaca mulatta, and the distributions of labeled cells and terminals were examined in subcortical structures. Although the connections of inferior temporal cortex with subcortical structures were found to be similar in infant and adult monkeys, several projections appear to undergo refinement during development. Quantitative analysis showed that 1) whereas the projection from TE to the superior colliculus is consistent (5 of 5 cases) and widespread in infants, it is less reliable (2 of 7 cases) and limited in areal extent in adults; 2) although the projections from TE to nucleus medialis dorsalis and the tail of the caudate are present in infants and adults, they are reduced in adults; and 3) TEO receives input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in both infants and adults, but the number of cells giving rise to this projection is lower in adults. There was also a suggestion that TE projects to nucleus paracentralis in infants (2 of 5 cases) but not in adults (0 of 7 cases). No differences between infants and adults were apparent in other subcortical connections, including those with the pulvinar, reticular nucleus, claustrum, and putamen.

The neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. We postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), or serotonin (SERT) transporter activities. In vivo, we determined DAT and NET occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the DAT, NET, SERT, and rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (TA1). In rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal DAT was detected by [C-11]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-4-(fluorophenyl) tropane and of thalamic NET by [C-11](S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl) morpholine. In vitro, modafinil effects in DAT-human embryonic kidney (HEK), NET-HEK, and SERT-HEK cells were investigated alone or combined with the TA1 receptor. Modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal DAT sites (5 mg/kg: 35 +/- 12%, n = 4; 8 mg/kg: 54 +/- 3%, n = 3). In thalamus, modafinil occupied NET sites (5 mg/kg: 16 +/- 7.8%, n = 6; 8 mg/ kg: 44 +/- 12%; n = 2). In vitro, modafinil inhibited [H-3] dopamine (IC50 = 6.4 mu M), [H-3] norepinephrine (IC50 = 35.6 mu M), and [H-3] serotonin (IC50 > 500 mu M) transport via the human DAT, NET, and SERT. Modafinil did not activate the TA1 receptor in TA1-HEK cells, but it augmented a monoamine transporter-dependent enhancement of phenethylamine activation of TA1 in TA1-DAT and TA1-NET cells, but not in TA1-SERT cells. The present data provide compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the DAT and NET in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.",nan; ANTINARCOLEPTIC DRUG; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; COCAINE; PET; AMPHETAMINE; WAKEFULNESS; MONKEYS; BINDING; RAT; BRAIN

Rapid adaptation in behavior has been attributed to frontal cortical circuits, but it is not clear if sensory cortexes also play an essential role in such tasks. In this study we tested whether the auditory cortex was necessary for rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds. We used a two-alternative choice sound-categorization task for rats in which the boundary that separated two acoustic categories changed several times within a behavioral session. These shifts in the boundary resulted in changes in the rewarded action for a subset of stimuli. We found that extensive lesions of the auditory cortex did not impair the ability of rats to switch between categorization contingencies and sound discrimination performance was minimally impaired. Similar results were obtained after reversible inactivation of the auditory cortex with muscimol. In contrast, lesions of the auditory thalamus largely impaired discrimination performance and, as a result, the ability to modify behavior across contingencies. Thalamic lesions did not impair performance of a visual discrimination task, indicating that the effects were specific to audition and not to motor preparation or execution. These results suggest that subcortical outputs of the auditory thalamus can mediate rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds.",auditory cortex; auditory thalamus; rat; flexibility; lesion; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BILATERAL ABLATION; MODULATED TONES; DISCRIMINATION; AMYGDALA; LOCALIZATION; PLASTICITY; LESIONS; DEACTIVATION; MACAQUES

Although many of the connections linked neighboring areas, others selectively connected relatively distant areas. Most, but not all, of the connections were reciprocal. Altogether, the connections formed at least two distinct networks within the OMPFC. The ''orbital'' prefrontal network linked most of the areas within the orbital cortex, with very few connections to medial prefrontal areas. Areas Iam, Iapm, Ial, 121, 12m, and 12r in the caudal and lateral parts of the orbital cortex (which received inputs from several sensory modalities) had convergent connections with areas 131, 13m, and 13b in the central orbital cortex, with further connections to the rostral orbital area 11l. For the connections between areas Iapm, Iam, Ial, 13m, 131, and 11l, rostrally directed fibers arose mainly in layer V, whereas caudally directed fibers originated mainly in layer III. The ''medial'' prefrontal network selectively involved medial areas 14r, 14c, 24, 25, 32, and 10m, rostral orbital areas 10o and 11m, and agranular insular area Iai in the posterior orbital cortex. Two orbital areas, 13a and 12o, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections. The two networks also had distinct connections with other cortical regions, with limbic structures, and with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Their role in guidance of affective behavior is discussed.

Areas V1, V2, and VS/MT are conserved across mammals and are central for visual behavior. To facilitate the generation of biologically accurate computational models of primate early visual processing, here we provide an overview of over 350 published studies of these three areas in the genus Macaca, whose visual system provides the closest model for human vision. The literature reports 14 anatomical connection types from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to V1 having distinct layers of origin or termination, and 194 connection types between V1, V2, and VS, forming multiple parallel and interacting visual processing streams. Moreover, within V1, there are reports of 286 and 120 types of intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively. Physiologically, tuning of neuronal responses to 11 types of visual stimulus parameters has been consistently reported. Overall, the optimal spatial frequency (SF) of constituent neurons decreases with cortical hierarchy. Moreover, VS neurons are distinct from neurons in other areas for their higher direction selectivity, higher contrast sensitivity, higher temporal frequency tuning, and wider SF bandwidth.

Previous studies have demonstrated marked differences in the relative sizes of ON and OFF responses of neurons in the whisker/barrel system. In particular, OFF responses are unexpectedly large in thalamic neurons. Extracellular unit recordings were used to examine whether varying the time between stimulus onset and offset differently affects OFF responses of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, ventrobasal thalamus, and somatosensory cortical layer IV. Controlled whisker stimuli were used to deflect individual vibrissal hairs in different directions. We hypothesized that, in part because of the gradual waning of central inhibition evoked by stimulus onset, OFF responses of thalamic and cortical neurons but not trigeminal ganglion cells would increase in size with longer duration stimuli, with relative changes being greatest in the cortex. 2. OFF response magnitudes for thalamic and cortical neuronal populations increased as the stimulus duration was increased from 200 to 1,400 ms. Increases were greater at nonoptimal deflection angles. Similarly, individual cells having smaller OFF responses for the short-duration stimulus tended to display proportionately greater increases when the stimulus was lengthened. OFF responses of trigeminal ganglion cells were largely unaffected by stimulus duration. 3. Barrel neurons were subclassified as regular-spike units (RSUs) or fast-spike units (FSUs) on the basis of the time course of their action potentials. ON and OFF responses were smaller in the former and, when the stimulus was lengthened, percentage increases in their OFF responses were greater than those in FSUs. Results illustrate nonlinear transformations of the thalamic input signal by RSUs, which are presumed to be excitatory barrel neurons, and extend previous findings of response similarities between thalamocortical units (TCUs) and FSUs, the latter of which are thought to be inhibitory.ate hyperpolarization. In behaving animals, thalamic inhibition and the LTS mechanism could counterbalance each other to maintain TCUs within an optimal range of responsiveness.",nan; INTRINSIC FIRING PATTERNS; MONKEYS MACACA-MULATTA; BARREL CORTEX; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VENTROBASAL THALAMUS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; VIBRISSA UNITS; ACTIVE TOUCH; SMI CORTEX

To test the mode of functional connectivity in the basal gan glia circuitry, we studied the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in the globus pallidus (GP) of a behaving rhesus monkey. The cross-correlograms of pairs of neurons in the GP were compared with those of neurons in the thalamus and frontal cortex and to the cross-correlograms of pallidal pairs after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. 2. In contrast with cortical and thalamic neuronal activity, almost all pairs (n = 76/81 pairs; 93.8%, 1,629/1,651 histograms; 98.7%) of GP neurons in the normal monkey were not driven by a common input. 3. The monkey was systemically treated with MPTP until the appearance of parkinsonian signs and an intermittent 7- to 11-Hz action/postural tremor. After the MPTP treatment, many pallidal neurons (49/140; 35%) became oscillatory, and 19% (n = 31/162) of pallidal pairs had oscillatory cross-correlograms. 4. These results support the model of parallel processing in the basal ganglia of normal monkeys and suggest a breakdown of the independent activity in the parkinsonian state.",nan; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SINGLE-UNITS; PRIMATE; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; STIMULATION; AFFERENTS

After intracortical microstimulation mapping of the forelimb area in the primary motor cortex of four macaque monkeys, a retrograde tracing study with fluorescent dyes was attempted to label simultaneously neurons in cortical and subcortical sites projecting to the distal forelimb representation area and those projecting to the proximal representation area of the primary motor cortex. Neurons projecting to distal and proximal forelimb parts of the primary motor cortex were largely separate in the following areas: the premotor area, primary somatosensory area, secondary somatosensory area, area 5, and thalamus. In contrast, there was no precise topographic organization of labeled projection neurons in the following areas: the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, primary motor cortex adjacent to the injection sites, claustrum, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The present study revealed that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives both segregated and intermixed inputs from cortical and subcortical sources. In particular, the fact that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives topographically organized inputs from the premotor area and nontopographically organized inputs from the supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area indicates possible different functional roles of frontal premotor areas in control of coordinated distal and proximal forelimb movements.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; FORELIMB MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; FLUORESCENT DYES; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CINGULATE CORTEX; MOVEMENTS; NEURONS

This morphological study of riMLF neurons in the rhesus monkey was undertaken to further our understanding of the functional circuitry of the oculomotor system. Our study employed Nissl, Golgi, and computer-assisted methods. The cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the riMLF and its relationships to neighboring structures were determined in both Nissl and Golgi preparations. Five (I-V) distinct morphological types of riMLF neurons were distinguished in the Golgi impregnations on the basis of soma size, dendritic size, numbers of primary dendrites, number of dendritic branch points, as well as form, number, and distribution of dendritic appendages. Type I neurons impregnated most frequently and had the most extensive and highly branched dendritic tree. Type II neurons displayed thick dendrites with complex dendritic appendages, but the dendritic tree was much more compact than that of type I cells. Type III and type V cells had fusiform somas and relatively unbranched dendritic trees but differed greatly in size as well as dendritic morphology. The type IV cell was the smallest neuron and had many characteristics of the local interneurons found in other thalamic, subthalamic, hypothalamic, and midbrain centers. The type V was the largest neuron, least frequently impregnated, and found only at rostral riMLF levels. Digitized reconstructions of each type of neuron were rotated by the computer, which revealed that the dendritic trees of types I, III, and V occupy a disk-like compartment in the riMLF neuropil. In contrast, the trees of types II and IV occupy a roughly spherical compartment. We suggest that three of the cell types are well suited for specific purposes: type II cells for receiving topographically organized inputs that contain spatial information, type I cells for short-lead burst neuron output to the motor neurons or other premotor centers, and type TV cells for inhibitory inputs to type I cells.

We report here the development of 3-(2-(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifzetidine) as a new putative high-affinity antagonist for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifzetidine in rat brain homogenate assays containing alpha 4 beta 2 sites labeled with H-3-cytisine exhibited a binding affinity: Ki=0.67 nM. The fluorine-18 analog, 3-(2-(5)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-nifzetidine), was synthesized in 20%-40% yield, and apparent specific activity was estimated to be above 2 Ci/mu mol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifzetidine to thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >85% by 150 mu M nicotine. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of F-18-nifzetidine in anesthetized rhesus monkey showed slow uptake in the various brain regions. Retention of (1)8(F)-nifzetidine was maximal in the thalamus and lateral geniculate followed by regions of the temporal and frontal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least uptake. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio was about 2.3 at 180 min postinjection and continued to rise. F-18-Nifzetidine shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. However, the slow kinetics suggests a need for >3-h PET scans for quantitative studies of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

An NPY Y1 PET tracer is useful for determining the level of target engagement by NPY Y1 antagonists in preclinical and clinical studies. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of [F-18]Y1-973, a novel PET tracer for NPY Vi. [F-18]Y1-973 was radiolabeled by reaction of a primary chloride with [F-18]KF/K2.2.2 followed by deprotection with HCl. [F-18]Y1-973 was produced with high radiochemical purity (>98%) and high specific activity (>1000 Ci/mmol). PET studies in rhesus monkey brain showed that the distribution of [F-18]Y1-973 was consistent with the known NPY Y1 distribution; uptake was highest in the striatum and cortical regions and lowest in the pons, cerebellum nuclei, and brain stem. Blockade of [F-18]Y1-973 uptake with NPY Y1 antagonist Y1-718 revealed a specific signal that was dose-dependently reduced in all regions of grey matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake, indicative of an NPY Y1 specific signal. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]Y1-973 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the in vivo PET studies. Highest binding density was observed in the dentate gyrus, caudate-putamen, and cortical regions; moderate binding density in the hypothalamus and thalamus; and lowest binding density in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human caudate-putamen homogenates confirmed a similarly high B-max/K-d ratio for [F-18]Y1-973, suggesting the tracer may provide a specific signal in human brain of similar magnitude to that observed in rhesus monkey. [F-18]Y1-973 is a suitable PET tracer for imaging NPY Y1 in rhesus monkey with potential for translation to human PET studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The object of this study is to confirm by immunoelectron-microscopy the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic connections containing parvalbumin in the monkey visual cortex, by the demonstration of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity in symmetric and asymmetric synapses. We analyzed the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive profiles at the ultrastructural level in the primary visual cortex of old world monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). It has been shown by others that parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells resemble non-spiny stellate cells, double-bouquet cells, chandelier and basket cells2,8,16,21. These neurons are known to be inhibitory and to form symmetric synapses. In fact, we observed that the vast majority of parvalbumin-immunoreactive synaptic contacts in the primary visual cortex of Macaca fascicularis are of the symmetric type (81.7%). Since parvalbumin-positive asymmetric contacts are also present (18.3%) and occur mostly in the thalamic recipient layers, 4C and 4A (9.9%), these afferents probably derive from parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons located in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.",IMMUNOELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; PARVALBUMIN; MONKEY VISUAL CORTEX; BINDING PROTEIN PARVALBUMIN; VISUAL-CORTEX; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OLD-WORLD; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; HETEROGENEITY; ORGANIZATION; LOCALIZATION; NEOCORTEX

However, the effectiveness of this technique has been limited by few methods to quantify in three dimensions the relative locations of brain structures, recording chambers and microelectrode trajectories. Here we present such a method. After surgical implantation, recording chambers are fitted with a plastic cylinder that is filled with a high-contrast agent to aid in the segmentation of the cylinder from brain matter in an MRI volume. The resulting images of the filled cylinder correspond to a virtual cylinder that is projected along its long axis - parallel to the trajectories of microelectrodes advanced through the recording chamber - through the three-dimensional image of the brain. This technique, which does not require a stereotaxic coordinate system, can be used to quantify the coverage of an implanted recording chamber relative to anatomical landmarks at any depth or orientation. We have used this technique in conjunction with Caret [Van Essen DC, Drury HA, Dickson J, Harwell J, Hanlon D, Anderson CH. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex.

Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent K+ conductances contribute to a slow AHP in thalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons: a novel target for orexin receptors. J Neurophysiol 104: 2052-2062, 2010. First published August 18, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00320.2010. Thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) neurons exhibit a postburst apamin-resistant slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) that is unique to midline thalamus, displays activity dependence, and is abolished in tetrodotoxin. Analysis of the underlying sI(AHP) confirmed a requirement for Ca2+ influx with contributions from P/Q-, N-, L-, and R subtype channels, a reversal potential near E-K(+) and a significant reduction by UCL-2077, barium or TEA, consistent with a role for K-Ca channels. sI(AHP) was significantly reduced by activation of either the cAMP or the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Further analysis of the sAHP revealed an activity-dependent but Ca2+-independent component that was reduced in high [K+](o) and blockable after Na+ substitution with Li+ or in the presence of quinidine, suggesting a role for K-Na channels. The Ca2+-independent sAHP component was selectively reduced by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. The sAHP contributed to spike frequency adaptation, which was sensitive to activation of either cAMP or PKC signaling pathways and, near the peak of membrane hyperpolarization, was sufficient to cause de-inactivation of low threshold T-Type Ca2+ channels, thus promoting burst firing. PVT neurons are densely innervated by orexin-immunoreactive fibers, and depolarized by exogenously applied orexins. We now report that orexin A significantly reduced both Ca2+-dependent and -independent sI(AHP), and spike frequency adaptation. Furthermore orexin A-induced sI(AHP) inhibition was mediated through activation of PKC but not PKA. Collectively, these observations suggest that K-Ca and K-Na channels have a role in a sAHP that contributes to spike frequency adaptation and neuronal excitability in PVT neurons and that the sAHP is a novel target for modulation by the arousal-and feeding-promoting orexin neuropeptides.",nan; ACTIVATED POTASSIUM CHANNEL; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; IN-VITRO; RAT-BRAIN; INTERMEDIATE-CONDUCTANCE; CHOLINERGIC ACTIONS; BURSTING NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MIDLINE NEURONS; CA2+ CHANNELS

CORTICAL AND SUBCORTICAL AFFERENTS,"In order to compare the frontal cortex of rat and macaque monkey, cortical and subcortical afferents to subdivisions of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in the rat were analyzed with fluorescent retrograde tracers. In addition to afferent inputs common to the whole MFC, each subdivision of the MFC has a specific pattern of afferent connections. The dorsally situated precentral medial area (PrCm) was the only area to receive inputs from the somatosensory cortex. The specific pattern of afferents common to the ventrally situated prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas included projections from the agranular insular cortex, the entorhinal and piriform cortices, the CA1-CA2 fields of the hippocampus, the subiculum, the endopiriform nucleus, the amygdalopiriform transition, the amygdalohippocampal area, the lateral tegmentum, and the parabrachial nucleus. In all these structures, the number of retrogradely labeled cells was larger when the injection site was located in area IL. The dorsal part of the anterior cingulate area (ACd) seemed to be connectionally intermediate between the adjacent areas PrCm and PL; it receives neither the somatosensory inputs characteristic of area PrCm nor the afferents characteristic of areas PL and IL, with the exception of the afferents from the caudal part of the retrosplenial cortex. A comparison of the pattern of afferent and efferent connections of the rat MFC with the pattern of macaque prefrontal cortex suggests that PrCm and ACd areas share some properties with the macaque premotor cortex, whereas PL and IL areas may have characteristics in common with the cingulate or with medial areas 24, 25, and 32 and with orbital areas 12, 13, and 14 of macaques.

Recovery of hand function is rapid, and, although it is incomplete, within a few months, the monkey uses the initially disabled hand and fingers with considerable skill. We examined the accompanying changes in the pattern of projection of corticospinal neurons to the cervical spinal cord that occurred following such a lesion. Spinal section was done both in newborn and juvenile macaques, and the postlesion period was followed for up to 150 weeks. Corticospinal neuron populations were visualized by using both anterogradely and retrogradely transported labels, and their origins, spinal pathways, and terminations were examined at intervals during the period of recovery of hand function. Immediately following unilateral section of the spinal cord at C3, sampled counts of soma profiles of retrogradely labeled neurons indicated that there was a profound reduction in the corticospinal projection to the hemicord caudal to the lesion. The few labeled corticospinal axons spared by the lesion bypassed the spinal lesion by descending in the contralateral cord and then crossing the midline caudal to the lesion. A few corticospinal axons may also have bypassed the lesion in the ipsilateral ventromedial column when this was not fully interrupted by the lesion. In every monkey, we observed a similar, profound reduction in the corticospinal (and rubrospinal) projections to the hemicord caudal to the lesion: This pattern did not alter significantly over an extended recovery period. An unchanging corticospinal projection to the cervical spinal cord contralateral to the lesion was also visualized in each monkey and resembled that seen in the normal macaque. Although the resolution of the labeling and counting procedures used precluded the identification of small increases in the numbers of corticospinal neurons projecting to the hemicord caudal to the lesion, we concluded that there was no substantial reconstruction of this projection over a recovery period of more than 2 years.

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10-15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28-35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.",alpha oscillation; episodic memory; memory consolidation; remote memory; theta oscillation; visual search; SHARP-WAVE RIPPLES; VISUAL EXPLORATION; POSTEROMEDIAL CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RESPONSES; MONKEYS; ACTIVATION; THALAMUS; SYSTEMS

The retrograde tracer experiments demonstrate projections to the FAG that arise primarily from the medial prefrontal areas 25, 32, and 10m, anterior cingulate, and dorsomedial areas 24b and 9, select orbital areas 14c, 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l, and ventrolateral area 6v. Only scattered cells were retrogradely labeled in other areas in the PFC. Caudal to the PFC, projections to the PAG also arise from the posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal dysgranular, and granular parts of the temporal polar cortex, the ventral insula, and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Cells were also labeled in subcortical structures, including the central nucleus and ventrolateral part of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal PAG columns. The projections from medial prefrontal areas 10m, 25, and 32 end predominantly in the dorsolateral columns, bilaterally. Fibers from orbital areas 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l terminate primarily in the ventrolateral column, whereas fibers from dorsomedial areas 9 and 24b terminate mainly in the lateral column. The PFC areas that project to the PAG include most of the areas previously defined as the medial prefrontal network. The areas that comprise this network represent a visceromotor system, distinct from the sensory related orbital network.

The present study examined with quantitative immunohistochemical methods the presence of glutamate in spinothalamic tract terminals of owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus). Such terminals in the posterior region, in which a nucleus was recently identified as a specific pain and temperature relay in macaques and humans, were labeled by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, injected into the spinal dorsal horn. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated with a postembedding immunogold procedure using a well-characterized glutamate antiserum. Quantitative analysis of the immunogold labeling demonstrated that the spinothalamic tract terminals contained more than twice the tissue average of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Enrichment of glutamate-like immunoreactivity was also found in terminals of presumed cortical origin. Presynaptic dendrites, cell bodies and non-vesicle-containing dendrites diplayed low levels of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.69; P<0.0001) was found between the density of synaptic vesicles and the density of gold particles in spinothalamic tract terminals, in contrast to a weak negative relationship (r=-0.28; P=0.089) present in GABAergic presynaptic dendrites. These data provide strong evidence that the gold labeling in the spinothalamic tract terminals represents transmitter labeling, implying that glutamate is a neurotransmitter for ascending nociceptive and thermoreceptive information in primates.",immunohistochemistry; thalamus; glutamate; pain; monkey; NON-NMDA RECEPTORS; SUBSTANCE-P; DORSAL HORN; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; IMMUNOGOLD ANALYSIS; SYNAPTIC TERMINALS; CAT THALAMUS; SPINAL-CORD; AMINO-ACIDS; RAT

In two cases the lesions were limited to the left thalamus, and in the third the right thalamus was involved. These deficits were associated with ipsilateral diencephalic, striatal, and dorsolateral prefrontal hypoperfusion. The damage implicated the ventral anterior nucleus, the mamillothalamic tract, and the rostroventral internal medullary lamina. These findings suggest that medial thalamic damage involving the ventral and rostral sector of the dorsal thalamus will concurrently affect functionally and neurally distinct limbodiencephalic pathways and diencephalic connections with the frontal cortex. A review of the neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings from previously reported cases with vascular lesions of the thalamus further supports this contention. The presence of frontal lobe-related cognitive deficits, though not obligatorily related to the memory problems, may contribute to some aspects of the memory deficits and affect the nature of the memory disorder observed in some cases with diencephalic amnesia.",nan; DISTURBANCE FOLLOWING INFARCTION; PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTION; LEFT DORSOMEDIAL NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; KORSAKOFFS SYNDROME; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL FOREBRAIN; MEMORY SYSTEM; LESIONS; PROJECTIONS

Various mechanisms, including divergence of preexisting connections, expression of latent synapses, and sprouting of new synapses, have been proposed to explain such phenomena, which probably underlie altered sensory experiences associated with limb amputation and peripheral nerve injury in humans. Putative cortical mechanisms have received the greatest emphasis but there is increasing evidence for substantial reorganization in subcortical structures, including the brainstem and thalamus, that may be of sufficient extent to account for or play a large part in representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex. Recent studies show that divergence of ascending connections is considerable and sufficient to ensure that small alterations in map topography at brainstem and thalamic levels will be amplified in the projection to the cortex. In the long term, slow, deafferentation-dependent transneuronal atrophy at brainstem, thalamic, and even cortical levels are operational in promoting reorganizational changes, and the extent to which surviving connections can maintain a map is a key to understanding differences between central and peripheral deafferentation.",divergence and convergence; neuronal atrophy; reorganization; thalamus; brainstem; lemniscal pathways; neurotransmitters; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; ADULT OWL MONKEYS; INTRATHALAMIC AUGMENTING RESPONSES; BICUCULLINE-INDUCED ALTERATIONS; FREQUENCY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; PRINCIPAL SENSORY NUCLEUS; PRIMARY AFFERENT-FIBERS; CUNEATE NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS

To examine the role of the anterior ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VLa) in motor control, extracellular single-cell recordings were made from the VLa nucleus in three conscious monkeys performing visually triggered, rapid movements requiring flexion and extension of the wrist joint. The movement paradigms consisted of three components: an initial hold period, a ballistic movement, and a final hold period. 2. Cerebellar nuclear stimulation was used to physiologically identify thalamic neurons receiving input from the cerebellum. Neurons subsequently confirmed histologically as lying within the VLa nucleus were located anterior to those ''driven'' by cerebellar stimulation. 3. The activities of 261 VLa neurons displaying movement-related behavior were examined. In the absence of movement, the activity of these neurons ranged from 5 to 80 spikes/s, the majority of cells (222/261; 85%) firing between 10 and 30 spikes/s. Neural activity was not influenced by afferent input from skin, joint, or muscle but altered markedly when the animal engaged in active movement. 4. The relationship between neural activity and movement at a specific joint was determined in 189 of the 261 neurons. The majority of these neurons (161/189; 85%) modulated their activity in response to movement confined to a single joint; the remaining neurons displayed multijoint motor responses, their activity being best related to a motor act, such as grasping, reaching, or feeding. There was no clear segregation in the representation of body parts in the VLa nucleus to suggest the presence of clearly defined somatotopy. 5. The activities of wrist-related neurons (45 of the 261) were examined to determine the motor characteristics of the VLa nucleus. Three distinctive activity patterns were exhibited by these neurons during the performance of the movement paradigms: 1) a phasic burst of <300 ms in duration (34/45; 76%); 2) a sustained change in neural activity lasting >300 ms (typically up to 1,000 ms; 4/45; 9%); and 3) both a phasic and a sustained response, the sustained response occurring either prior or subsequent to the phasic response (7/45; 15%). 6. The movement-related activity of the wrist-related neurons occurred late, 52% firing after the onset of the forearm electromyogram (EMG). In 47% of the neurons, discharge rate was related to movement direction and, in a smaller proportion (13%), joint position. No relationship was found between neural activity patterns and amplitude of movement or velocity of movement. 7. The timing and pattern of neural activity in VLa indicates that it is unlikely that cells in this nucleus are involved in the selection or activation of muscles for the initiation of a motor action or the coding of the physical parameters of movement.",nan; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MACACA-MULATTA; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SEQUENTIAL MOVEMENTS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; NEURONAL DISCHARGE; BEHAVING MONKEY

Here we have explored the types of neurons in the macaque vestibular nuclei targeted by nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition using orthodromic identification from the caudal vermis. We found that all nodulus-target neurons are tuned to vestibular stimuli, and most are insensitive to eye movements. Such non-eye-movement neurons are thought to project to vestibulo-spinal and/or thalamo-cortical pathways. Less than 20% of nodulus-target neurons were sensitive to eye movements, suggesting that the caudal vermis can also directly influence vestibulo-ocular pathways. In general, response properties of nodulus-target neurons were diverse, spanning the whole continuum previously described in the vestibular nuclei. Most nodulus-target cells responded to both rotation and translation stimuli and only a few were selectively tuned to translation motion only. Other neurons were sensitive to net linear acceleration, similar to otolith afferents. These results demonstrate that, unlike the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus which target a particular cell group, nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition targets a large diversity of cell types in the vestibular nuclei, consistent with a broad functional significance contributing to vestibulo-ocular, vestibulo-thalamic and vestibulo-spinal pathways.",nan; ANGULAR VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; SECONDARY VESTIBULOCEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; INNERVATING OTOLITH ORGANS; INDIVIDUAL PURKINJE-CELLS; MODULATE SIMPLE SPIKES; DORSAL Y-GROUP; SQUIRREL-MONKEY

The radiosynthesis of 2-F-18-fluoro-3-[2-((S)-3-pyrrolinyl)methoxy]pyridine (F-18-nifene) was accomplished in 2.5 h with an overall radiochemical yield of 40-50%, decay corrected. The specific activity was estimated to be approx. 37-185 GBq/mu mol. In vitro alltoradiography in rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifene to anteroventral thalamic (AVT) nucleus, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. Rat cerebellum showed some binding, whereas regions in the hippocampus had the lowest binding. The highest ratio of > 13 between AVT and cerebellum was measured for F-18-nifene in rat brain slices. The specific binding was reduced (> 95%) by 300 mu M nicotine in these brain regions. Positron emission tomography imaging Study of F-18-nifene (130 MBq) in anesthetized rhesus monkey was carried Out using all ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. PET Study showed selective maximal uptake in the regions of the anterior medial thalamus, ventro-lateral thalamus, lateral geniculate, cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex including the subiculum. The cerebellum in the monkeys showed lower binding than the other regions, Thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio peaked at 30-35 min postinjection to a value of 2.2 and subsequently reduced. The faster binding profile of F-18-nifene indicates promise as a PET imaging agent and thus needs further evaluation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The relative balance of flexible, goal-directed responding as compared to inflexible habitual responding is highly dependent on experience (e.g., training history in a task) and conditions under which the behavior was formed. Reinforcer devaluation tasks have been used widely across species to study the neurobiology of goal-directed behavior. In rodents, under some conditions, extended training in reinforcer devaluation tasks transforms goal-directed responses into habits, rendering the animals insensitive to devaluation. In nonhuman primates, no studies have previously evaluated the impact of extended training. Here we trained four macaques in a variant of the standard reinforcer devaluation task (Malkova et al., 1997), in which we presented objects with either a standard number of exposures (i.e., up to 55) or with a high number of exposures (i.e., up to 454). We tested for goal-directed behavior at three time points during the course of this extended training with different combinations of high- and low-repetition objects and stratified results based on whether the preferred or nonpreferred reinforcer was devalued. We found robust devaluation effects across all three cycles of training; however, the magnitude of the effect was modulated by reinforcer preference and by the relative training history of the objects. These data argue against habit formation after overtraining in the reinforcer devaluation task in macaques, a finding that is consistent with reports in humans and with tasks in rodents that employ multiple stimuli, reinforcers, and instrumental actions.",goal-directed behavior; nonhuman primate; neuroeconomics; behavioral flexibility; outcome devaluation; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; MOTIVATIONAL CONTROL; TRANSIENT INACTIVATION; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; REWARD DEVALUATION

Whether human children are vulnerable to this toxicity mechanism remains unknown, as there are no imaging techniques to capture it. Apoptosis is characterized by distinct structural features, which affect the way damaged tissue scatters ultrasound compared to healthy tissue. We evaluated whether apoptosis, triggered by the anesthetic sevoflurane in the brains of neonatal rhesus macaques, can be detected using quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Neonatal (n = 15) rhesus macaques underwent 5 h of sevoflurane anesthesia. QUS images were obtained through the sagittal suture at 0.5 and 6 h. Brains were collected at 8 h and examined immunohistochemically to analyze apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Significant apoptosis was detected in white and gray matter throughout the brain, including the thalamus. We measured a change in the effective scatterer size (ESS), a QUS biomarker derived from ultrasound echo signals obtained with clinical scanners, after sevoflurane-anesthesia in the thalamus. Although initial inclusion of all measurements did not reveal a significant correlation, when outliers were excluded, the change in the ESS between the pre- and post-anesthesia measurements correlated strongly and proportionally with the severity of apoptotic death. We report for the first time in vivo changes in QUS parameters, which may reflect severity of apoptosis in the brains of infant nonhuman primates. These findings suggest that QUS may enable in vivo studies of apoptosis in the brains of human infants following exposure to anesthetics, antiepileptics and other brain injury mechanisms.",Apoptosis; Sevoflurane; Quantitative ultrasound; Thalamus; Brain injury; Neonatal; Development; Imaging; Primate; ACOUSTIC SCATTERING SOURCES; NORMAL RENAL PARENCHYMA; REFERENCE PHANTOM; EARLY EXPOSURE; CELL-DEATH; ISOFLURANE EXPOSURE; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BACKSCATTER; FETAL; CANCER

Large injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase or small injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were made in the medial geniculate complex of Macaca fuscata. The terminal distributions of labeled axons in the cortex were correlated with auditory cortical fields demonstrable by different intensities of immunoreactivity for parvalbumin. Fibers from the ventral nucleus terminated mainly in layer TV and deep portion of layer III (IIIB), with additional terminations in layers I-IIIA and in layer VI. In layers IIIB-IV, a major terminal plexus was formed by a small number of dense patches, 300-500 mu m in diameter, surrounded by smaller satellite patches. The patches conformed to a similarly lobulated pattern of parvalbumin fiber immunoreactivity. Terminations of some individually labeled thalamocortical fibers were restricted to a single patch, whereas others innervated more than one patch by collateral branches. Fibers from the dorsad nuclei ending in areas of less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity surrounding the primary auditory cortex formed much larger terminal patches centered largely in layer IIIB. Fibers from the magnocellular nucleus had relatively few terminal branches but innervated extremely wide areas by collaterals of single axons. Two types of axons arose from the magnocellular nucleus, one terminating preferentially in middle cortical layers and the other exclusively in layer I. These may arise respectively from parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cell populations in the magnocellular nucleus.

Lamina I axons in the contralateral spinal white matter were of particular interest, because these include spinothalamic tract (STT) axons. These were clearly concentrated in the middle of the lateral funiculus, that is, in the location of the classically described lateral STT of humans. At the C1-2 level, they were more ventrally located. There was evidence of a general topography, in that lumbar axons were located superficially and cervical axons were located medially. There was some dispersion, in that a few axons were also found move dorsally and more ventrally (especially at the midthoracic level), and there was some variability between cases. In addition, ascending axons were more widely distributed in the ipsilateral white matter. These observations are consistent with prior anterograde findings in the cat. Together with clinical and other evidence, these observations indicate that lamina I neurons have an integral role in the effects of spinal lesions on pain, temperature, and itch sensations.",spinothalamic; anterolateral cordotomy; pain; lamina I; monkey; SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT NEURONS; DORSAL HORN NEURONS; LEUKOAGGLUTININ PHA-L; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTOR; NOXIOUS HEAT STIMULI; BEHAVIORAL THERMOSENSITIVITY; SENSORY ABNORMALITIES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THERMAL STIMULI

However, visual field specializations have not been studied in the dorsal visual stream, dedicated to processing visual motion and visually guided behaviors. To investigate this, we injected retrograde neuronal tracers occupying the whole visuotopic representation of the middle temporal (MT) visual area in marmoset monkeys and studied the distribution and morphology of the afferent primary visual cortex (V1) projections. Contrary to previous reports, we found a heterogeneous population of V1-MT projecting neurons distributed in layers 3C and 6. In layer 3C, spiny stellate neurons were distributed mainly in foveal representations, while pyramidal morphologies were characteristic of peripheral eccentricities. This primate adaptation of the V1 to MT pathway is arranged in a way that we had not previously understood, with abundant stellate projection neurons in the high-resolution foveal portions, suggesting rapid relay of motion information to visual area MT. We also describe that the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), which is the main thalamic input to area MT, shows a retinotopic organization, likely reflecting the importance of this pathway during development and the establishment of area MT topography.",nonhuman primate; spiny stellate neurons; pulvinar; retinotopy; primary visual cortex; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; EARLY MATURATION; PULVINAR

This radioligand binds with high affinity and specificity to monkey cortical sections. Specific inhibitors of converting enzyme, lisinopril and perindoprilat compete for the radioligand binding to monkey cortex sections with inhibitory constants of 10 nM. High concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in most components of the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus, putamen, the internal and external globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The distribution of converting enzyme in the caudate nucleus and putamen is heterogeneous, with prominent patches of higher activity. The patches in the caudate nucleus correspond closely with the acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. In the hypothalamus, very high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk and high concentrations occur in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moderate, diffuse binding is observed in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and in the anterior, lateral, ventromedial, posterior and arcuate nuclei. In the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural and subfornical organs exhibit high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the pineal body display moderate enzyme activities whereas the area postrema is devoid of labelling. The interpeduncular nucleus and, in the hippocampal formation, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are also intensely labelled. High levels of angiotensin converting enzyme activity are also detected throughout the cerebral cortex with laminations of higher activity corresponding to cell dense layers of the cortex. Layered binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex, with the most intense labelling in the molecular layer. Moderate concentrations of converting enzyme also occur in the paraventricular, medial habenula, lateral habenula and central median nuclei of the thalamus, the amygdala, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus. The dorsal vagal complex, inferior olivary nucleus and the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus all display high levels of binding. Moderate, diffuse labelling is found throughout the reticular region and is also present in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Although the overall distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme in the monkey brain resembles that in the rat, there are some striking differences. These include the high levels of binding throughout the monkey cerebral cortex and in the interpeduncular and suprachiasmatic nuclei.",nan; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; II RECEPTOR-BINDING; RAT-BRAIN; STRIATONIGRAL PATHWAY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANCE-P; LOCALIZATION; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; FOREBRAIN; STRIATUM

The present study examined stimulus-evoked brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female cynomolgus macaques following unilateral L7 spinal nerve ligation and the effects of clinical analgesics pregabalin, duloxetine, and morphine on brain activation in these macaques. A modified straight leg raise test was used to assess pain severity in awake animals and to evoke regional brain activation in anesthetized animals. The potential effects of clinical analgesics on both awake pain behavior and regional brain activation were examined. Following spinal nerve ligation, both male and female macaques showed significantly decreased ipsilateral straight leg raise thresholds, suggesting the presence of radicular-like pain. Morphine treatment increased straight leg raise thresholds in both males and females whereas duloxetine and pregabalin did not. In male macaques, the ipsilateral straight leg raise activated contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII), and thalamus. In female macaques, the ipsilateral leg raise activated cingulate cortex and contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex. Straight leg raises of the contralateral, unligated leg did not evoke brain activation. Morphine reduced activation in all brain regions in both male and female macaques. In males, neither pregabalin nor duloxetine decreased brain activation compared with vehicle treatment. In females, however, pregabalin and duloxetine decreased the activation of cingulate cortex compared with vehicle treatment. The current findings suggest a differential activation of brain areas depending on sex following a peripheral nerve injury. Differential brain activation observed in this study could underlie qualitative sexual dimorphism in clinical chronic pain perception and responses to analgesics. Future pain management approaches for neuropathic pain will need to consider potential sex differences in pain mechanism and treatment efficacy.",biomarkers; functional magnetic resonance imaging; lumbar radicular pain; Macaca fascicularis; neuroimaging; neuropathic pain; sciatica; straight leg raise; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; OSTEOARTHRITIS; NOCICEPTION; DULOXETINE; PREGABALIN; RECEPTORS; ANALGESIA; PLACEBO; MODEL

It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages in binge alcohol drinking (occasional consumption of four to five drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy alcohol drinking (binge drinking on >5 d in a month). Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years of age) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following similar to 6 and similar to 12 months of daily (22 h/d) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1ml/1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol drinking reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.",underage drinking; brain growth; magnetic resonance imaging; thalamus; white matter; ethanol; self administration; HEAVY-DRINKING; USE DISORDERS; CEREBELLAR VOLUME; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MATURATION; MONKEYS; AGE; INTOXICATION; CHILDHOOD; CORTEX

The local-global paradigm dissociates two hierarchical levels of auditory predictive coding by examining the brain responses to first-order (local) and second-order (global) sequence violations. Using the macaque model, we previously demonstrated that, in the awake state, local violations cause focal auditory responses while global violations activate a brain circuit comprising prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices. Here we used the same local-global auditory paradigm to clarify the encoding of the hierarchical auditory regularities in anesthetized monkeys and compared their brain responses to those obtained in the awake state as measured with fMRI. Both, propofol, a GABAA-agonist, and ketamine, an NMDA-antagonist, left intact or even enhanced the cortical response to auditory inputs. The local effect vanished during propofol anesthesia and shifted spatially during ketamine anesthesia compared with wakefulness. Under increasing levels of propofol, we observed a progressive disorganization of the global effect in prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices and its complete suppression under ketamine anesthesia. Anesthesia also suppressed thalamic activations to the global effect. These results suggest that anesthesia preserves initial auditory processing, but disturbs both short-term and long-term auditory predictive coding mechanisms. The disorganization of auditory novelty processing under anesthesia relates to a loss of thalamic responses to novelty and to a disruption of higher-order functional cortical networks in parietal, prefrontal and cingular cortices.

However, the neuronal specificity achieved with both methods is not well understood. Here we compare cell-targeted optogenetics and electrical microstimulation in the macaque monkey brain to functionally map the koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) projection to primary visual cortex (V1). Selective activation of the LGN konio neurons with CamK-specific optogenetics caused selective electrical current inflow in the supra-granular layers of V1. Electrical microstimulation targeted at LGN konio layers revealed the same supra-granular V1 activation pattern as the one elicited by optogenetics. Taken together, these findings establish a selective koniocellular LGN influence on V1 supra-granular layers, and they indicate comparable capacities of both stimulation methods to isolate thalamo-cortical circuits in the primate brain.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONS IN-VIVO; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; MONKEY; PATHWAYS; SYSTEM; STIMULATION

In the present study, we compared the patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate (marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the species but also on the input projections.",lentiviral vector; pseudotyping; retrograde gene transfer; cerebral cortex; thalamus; neuron specificity; inflammation; primates; GENE-TRANSFER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EFFICIENT; ACCESS; TRANSDUCTION; TRANSPORT; CIRCUIT; NUCLEUS; OUTPUT

In particular, the norepinephrine transporter is a target in the brain of many therapeutic and abused drugs. We used the selective ligand [H-3]nisoxetine, therefore, to describe autoradiographically the normal regional distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate central nervous system, thereby providing a baseline to which alterations due to pathological conditions can be compared. The norepinephrine transporter in the monkey brain was distributed heterogeneously, with highest levels occurring in the locus coeruleus complex and raphe nuclei, and moderate binding density in the hypothalamus, midline thalamic nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and brainstem nuclei such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Low levels of binding to the norepinephrine transporter were measured in basolateral amygdala and cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. The distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate brain was comparable overall to that described in other species, however disparities exist between the rodent and the monkey in brain regions that play a role in such critical processes as memory and learning. The differences in such areas point to the possibility of important functional differences in noradrenergic information processing across species, and suggest the use of caution in applying findings made in the rodent to the human condition.

These fibers are composed of a dense plexus of thin beaded axons which ensheath an unstained central core. Such structures are not confined to the globus pallidus, but are also present in the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the hypothalamus, the dorsal part of the amygdala, and ventrally in the basal forebrain. The present study describes the relationship between projections from the rostral and ventral striatum and the enkephalin- and substance P-positive wooly fibers. Following injections of either tritiated amino acids or the lectin PHaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the ventral striatum, anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals in the forebraine were visualized simultaneously with enkephalin- or substance P immunoreactivity in the same tissue section in order to determine: (i) the extent to which the woolly fiber distribution represents striatal output systems; (ii) whether woolly fibers can be considered as a marker for the entire striatal forebrain projection; and (iii) whether enkephalin and substance P are involved differentially in distinct ventral striatopallidal pathways. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin labeling is seen in the globus pallidus and adjacent structures either as single, beaded fibers or in a profile strikingly similar to that of woolly fibers. In tissue sections treated for a double immunohistochemical protocol, following which the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin-immunoreactive fibers turn black and the peptidergic woolly fibers brown; many of the lectin-positive fibers are seen to enter the peptide-positive woolly fiber plexus. Likewise, following the injections with tritiated amino acids in the ventral striatum, coarse structures that have dimensions resembling those of the woolly fibers are identified. In sections immunohistochemically stained and subsequently treated for autoradiography, peptide-positive woolly fibers can be identified underlying the silver strains. In sections stained for both peptide immunoreactivity and tracer substances, enkephalin or substance P-positive woolly fibers are present in all pallidal regions that receive ventral striatal input. However, the ventral striatum also sends fibers to the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the dorsal part of the amygdala, the septum, the preoptic area, and other areas of the basal forebrain. In these nuclei the peptide-positive woolly fiber distribution is less extensive than the terminal labeling. The distribution of substance P-positive fibers in the subcommissural pallidal region is more limited than the distribution of enkephalinergic fibers. The distribution of substance P wooly fibers coincides well with the distribution of inputs from the most ventral striatal region including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen. These results suggest that enkephalin- and substance P-positive woolly fibers outside the pallidum appear to represent striatal efferent projections. However, these peptide-positive woolly fibers are not a marker for the full extent of the striatal projections. Finally, substance P immunoreactivity in the region beneath the anterior commissure arises from the most ventral portion of the ventral striatum, in particular the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen.",nan; SUBSTANCE-P IMMUNOREACTIVITY; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; OLFACTORY TUBERCLE; PROJECTIONS; RAT

In contrast, the projections from the pulvinar nucleus to the cortex are less clearly defined. The pulvinar projects predominantly to layer I in V1, and layer IV in extrastriate areas. These projection patterns suggest that the pulvinar nucleus most strongly influences (drives) activity in cortical areas beyond V1. Should this hypothesis be true, one would expect the spatiotemporal responses evoked by pulvinar activation to be different in V1 and extrastriate areas, reflecting the different connectivity patterns. We investigated this issue by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical visual areas' activity following thalamic electrical microstimulation in tree shrews, using optical imaging and voltage-sensitive dyes. As expected, electrical stimulation of the dLGN induced fast and local responses in V1, as well as in extrastriate and contralateral cortical areas.

In slow-wave sleep, spindles (7-16 Hz) are a prominent spontaneous oscillation generated by thalamic circuits and triggered by cortical slow waves. In wakefulness and under anesthesia, brief peripheral sensory stimuli can evoke 10-Hz reverberations due potentially to similar thalamic mechanisms. Functionally, sleep spindles and peripherally evoked spindles may play a role in memory consolidation and perception, respectively. Yet, rarely have the circuits involved in these two rhythms been compared in the same animals and never in primates. Here, we investigated the entrainment of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons to both rhythms in ketamine-sedated macaques. First, we compared spontaneous spindles in sedation and natural sleep to validate the model. Then, we quantified entrainment with spike-field coherence and phase-locking statistics. We found that S1 neurons entrained to spontaneous sleep spindles were also entrained to the evoked spindles, although entrainment strength and phase systematically differed. Our results indicate that the spindle oscillations triggered by top-down spontaneous cortical activity and bottom-up peripheral input share a common cortical substrate. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Brief sensory stimuli evoke 10-Hz oscillations in thalamocortical neuronal activity and in perceptual thresholds. The mechanisms underlying this evoked rhythm are not well understood but are thought to be similar to those generating sleep spindles. We directly compared the entrainment of cortical neurons to both spontaneous spindles and peripherally evoked oscillations in sedated monkeys. We found that the entrainment strengths to each rhythm were positively correlated, although with differing entrainment phases, implying involvement of similar networks.",entrainment; primate; sleep spindles; somatosensory cortex; PHASE-LOCKING; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SLEEP SPINDLES; MECHANISMS; INTERNEURONS; POTENTIALS; PATTERNS; NUCLEUS

We further analyzed this structural functional relationship by comparing the developmental pattern of TNAP activity to the maturation of the thalamocortical afferents in the primate brain (Callithrix jacchus). Cortical expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity reflects the sequential maturation of the modality-specific sensory areas. Within the visual cortex, the regional and laminar distribution of AP correlates with the differential maturation of the magno- and parvocellular streams. AP activity, which is transiently expressed in the white matter, exhibits a complementary distributional pattern with myelin staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that AP activity is localized exclusively to the myelin-free axonal segments, including the node of Ranvier. It was also found that AP activity is gradually expressed in parallel with the maturation of synaptic contacts in them neuropile. These data suggest the involvement of AP, in addition to neurotransmitter synthesis previously suggested in the adult, in synaptic stabilization and in myelin pattern formation and put forward a role of AP in cortical plasticity and brain disorders.

We examined vestibular input to the periarcuate cortex in the Japanese monkey by analyzing laminar field potentials evoked by electrical Stimulation of the vestibular nerve. Laminar field potential analysis in the depths of the cerebral cortex showed that vestibular-evoked potentials consisted of early-positive and late-negative potentials and early-negative and late-positive potentials in the superficial and deep layers of the periarcuate cortex. respectively. with latencies of 4.8-6.3 ms, Suggesting that these potentials were directly conveyed to the cortex through the thalamus. These potentials were distributed continuously in the fundus, dorsal and ventral banks of the spur and the bottom of the junctional part of the arcuate sulcus and spur. This vestibular-projecting area overlapped the cortical distribution of corticovestibular neurons that were retrogradely labeled by tracer injection into the vestibular nuclei (previously reported area 6pa), and also the distribution of smooth pursuit-related neurons recorded in the periarcuate cortex including area 8 in a trained monkey.

Given the high prevalence of pain in diabetic patients and crosstalk between chemokines and opioids, it is pivotal to know whether neuroinfiammation-associated mediators are dysregulated in the central nervous system of diabetic primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether mRNA expression levels of glial markers, chemokines, and opioid receptors are altered in the spinal cord and thalamus of naturally occurring type 2 diabetic monkeys (n = 7) compared with age-matched non-diabetic monkeys (n = 6). By using RT-qPCR, we found that mRNA expression levels of both GFAP and IBA1 were up-regulated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of diabetic monkeys compared with non-diabetic monkeys. Among all chemokines, expression levels of three chemokine ligand-receptor systems, i.e., CCL2-CCR2, CCL3-CCR1/5, and CCL4-CCR5, were up-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys. Moreover, in the SDH, seven additional chemokine receptors, i.e., CCR4, CCR6, CCR8, CCR10, CXCR3, CXCR5, and CXCR6, were also up-regulated in diabetic monkeys. In contrast, expression levels of MOP, KOP, and DOP, but not NOP receptors, were down-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys, and the thalamus had fewer changes in the glial markers, chemokines and opioids. These findings indicate that neuroin-fiammation, manifested as glial activation and simultaneous up-regulation of multiple chemokine ligands and receptors, seems to be permanent in type 2 diabetic monkeys. As chemokines and opioids are important pain modulators, this first-in-primate study provides a translational bridge for determining the functional efficacy of spinal drugs targeting their signaling cascades.

Our specific goals were to assess the prevalence and the degree of orientation tuning in the monkey LGN and to determine if the preferred stimulus orientations of LGN neurons varied as a function of receptive-field position. The primary motivation for this research was to gain insight into the receptive-field configuration of LGN neurons and consequently into the neural mechanisms which determine the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields in primates. In both the parvocellular and magnocellular layers, the responses of the majority of individual neurons to sine-wave gratings varied as a function of stimulus orientation. The influence of stimulus orientation was, however, highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the stimulus; the greatest degree of orientation bias was observed for spatial frequencies higher than the cell's optimal spatial frequency. On a population basis, the degree of orientation bias was similar for all major classes of LGN neurons (e.g. ON vs. OFF center; parvocellular vs. magnocellular) and did not vary systematically with receptive-field eccentricity. At a given receptive-field location, LGN neurons, particularly cells in the parvocellular laminae, tended to prefer either radially oriented stimuli or stimuli oriented more horizontally than their polar axis. Our analyses of the orientation-dependent changes in spatial-frequency response functions, which was based on the Soodak et al., (1987; Soodak, 1986) two-dimensional, difference-of-Gaussian receptive-field model, suggested that the orientation bias in LGN neurons was due to an elongation of the receptive-field center mechanism which in some cases appeared to consist of multiple subunits. Direct comparisons of the orientation-tuning characteristics of LGN cells and their retinal inputs (S potentials) indicated that the orientation bias in the monkey LGN reflects primarily the functional properties of individual retinal ganglion cells.

We report the development and evaluation of a putative antagonist, 5-(3'-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (nifrolidine) as a PET agent for nicotine alpha(4)beta(2) receptors. Methods: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine was measured in rat brain slices labeled with I-125-iodoepibatidine or I-125-bungaratoxin. Selectivity of binding was measured in the presence of cytisine. F-18 radiolabeling was performed by reacting the tosylate precursor with F-18-fluoride followed by cleprotection. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain slices with 5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (F-18-nifrolidine) were read on a phosphor imager. Rats were injected with F-18-nifrolidine (3.7 MBq each), and brain regions were counted at various times (2-120 min). Blocking studies were performed by subcutaneous injection of nicotine (10 mg/kg). A PET study of F-18-nifrolidine (approximately 148 MBq) was performed on an anesthetized rhesus monkey using a high-resolution scanner. Results: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine exhibited an inhibition constant of 2.89 nmol/L for the alpha(4)beta(2) sites. Radiosynthesis and high-performance liquid chromatography purifications yielded the product in approximately 20%-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield to provide 18F-nifrolidine specific activities of approximately 111-185 GBq/mumol. In vitro autoradiography in rat brain slices revealed selective binding of F-18-nifrolidine to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, ventral posteriomedial thalamus, dorsolateral geniculate, and, to a lesser extent, cortex and striata, which are known to contain alpha(4)beta(2) sites. This specific binding was completely abolished by 300 mumol/L nicotine. Ex vivo rat brain distribution studies indicated selective binding in the thalamus with a maximal thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. The PET study revealed selective maximal uptake (0.01 % injected dose/mL) in regions of the thalamus (anteroventral and anteromedial mus, ventrolateral thalamus) and extrathalamic regions such as cingulate gyrus, lateral geniculate, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. Conclusion: Binding of F-18-nifrolidine to alpha(4)beta(2) receptor-rich regions in rats and monkeys indicates promise as a PET agent. Additionally, the thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio approached a plateau of 1.7 in 120 min, indicating relatively faster kinetics compared with previously reported imaging agents.",alpha(4)beta(2) nicotine receptors; PET; F-18; nifrolidine; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; HUMAN-BRAIN; BINDING-SITES; IMAGING AGENT; AGONIST; SUBTYPES; ANALOGS; LIGAND; BIODISTRIBUTION

CPSP is hypothesized to be caused by maladaptive reorganization between various brain regions. The treatment for CPSP has not been established; however, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex has a clinical effect. To verify the functional reorganization hypothesis for CPSP development and rTMS therapeutic mechanism, we longitudinally pursued the structural and functional changes of the brain by using two male CPSP model monkeys (Macaca fuscata) developed by unilateral hemorrhage in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Application of rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex relieved the induced pain of the model monkeys. A tractography analysis revealed a decrease in the structural connectivity in the ipsilesional thalamocortical tract, and rTMS had no effect on the structural connectivity. A region of interest analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed inappropriately strengthened functional connectivity between the ipsilesional mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala, which are regions associated with emotion and memory, suggesting that this may be the cause of CPSP development. Moreover, rTMS normalizes this strengthened connectivity, which may be a possible therapeutic mechanism of rTMS for CPSP.",nan; nan

However, it is unclear whether the same intervention would be effective for thermal hyperalgesia. Therefore, using the macaque model, we examined behavioural responses to thermal stimuli following pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII. Methods Two CPSP model macaques were established based on collagenase-induced unilateral hemorrhagic lesions in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. To evaluate pain perception, withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 37, 45, 50, 52, and 55 degrees C to hands were measured. Several weeks after the lesion induction, pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII by microinjection of muscimol was performed. The effect of inactivation on withdrawal latency was assessed by comparison with withdrawal latency after vehicle injection. Results Several weeks after induction of the thalamic lesions, both macaques demonstrated a reduction in withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation (<50 degrees C) on the contralesional hand, indicating the occurrence of thermal hyperalgesia. When the PIC/SII were inactivated by muscimol, the withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 50 and 52 degrees C were significantly increased compared to those after vehicle injection. Conclusions Our data emphasize that increased activity in the PIC/SII after appearance of thalamic lesions can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities, and the modulation of PIC/SII activity may be a therapeutic approach for thermal hyperalgesia. Significance CPSP is caused by stroke lesions in the sensory system and characterized by mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia. Inactivation of the PIC/SII has an analgesic effect on mechanical allodynia; however, it is not clear whether the same intervention could reduce thermal hyperalgesia. Here, using the macaque model, we demonstrated that inactivation of these cortices reduces hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli. This result emphasizes that increased PIC/SII activity can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities.",nan; CENTRAL POSTSTROKE PAIN; INSULAR CORTEX; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; ALLODYNIA; STIMULATION; LESION; MODEL; HEAT

Not only were movements evoked from motor areas (PMC and M1), but they were also evoked from posterior parietal (5, 7a, 7b) and anterior parietal areas (3b, 1, 2). Large representations of digit movements involving only the index finger (D2) and thumb (D1), were elicited from areas 1, 2, 7b, and M1. Other movements evoked from these regions were similar to ethologically relevant movements that have been described in other primates. These include combined forelimb and mouth movements and full hand grasps. However, many other movements were much more complex and could not be categorized into any of the previously described ethological categories. Movements involving specific digits, which mimic precision grips, are unique to macaques and have not been described in New World or prosimian primates. We propose that these multiple and expanded motor representations of the digits co-evolved with the emergence of the opposable thumb and alterations in grip type in some anthropoid lineages.",grasping; posterior parietal cortex; primate; reaching; somatosensory cortex; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; IPSILATERAL CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; COMPLEX MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; AREA 5; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; POSTSPIKE FACILITATION

Because nerve fibers reflect local skin deformations, they individually carry ambiguous signals about object features. In contrast, cortical neurons exhibit heterogeneous response properties that reflect computations applied to convergent input from multiple classes of afferents, which confer to them a selectivity for behaviorally relevant features of objects. The conventional view is that these complex response properties arise within the cortex itself, implying that sensory signals are not processed to any significant extent in the two intervening structures-the cuneate nucleus (CN) and the thalamus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the responses evoked in the CN to a battery of stimuli that have been extensively used to characterize tactile coding in both the periphery and cortex, including skin indentations, vibrations, random dot patterns, and scanned edges. We found that CN responses are more similar to their cortical counterparts than they are to their inputs: CN neurons receive input from multiple classes of nerve fibers, they have spatially complex receptive fields, and they exhibit selectivity for object features. Contrary to consensus, then, the CN plays a key role in processing tactile information.",touch; neural coding; receptive fields; vibration; integration; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; TARGET NEURONS; ISOFLURANE; HAND; CORTEX; TOUCH; RAT; REPRESENTATION; TRANSMISSION

According to the classical view, orientation tuning arises from the integration of untuned input from thalamic neurons with aligned but spatially displaced receptive fields (RFs). In a recent microneurography study with human subjects, the precise temporal structure of the responses of individual mechanoreceptive afferents to scanned edges was found to carry information about their orientation. This putative mechanism could in principle contribute to or complement the classical rate-based code for orientation. In the present study, we further examine orientation information carried by mechanoreceptive afferents of Rhesus monkeys. To this end, we record the activity evoked in cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents when edges are indented into or scanned across the skin. First, we confirm that information about the edge orientation can be extracted from the temporal patterning in afferent responses of monkeys, as is the case in humans. Second, we find that while the coarse temporal profile of the response can be predicted linearly from the layout of the RF, the fine temporal profile cannot. Finally, we show that orientation signals in tactile afferents are often highly dependent on stimulus features other than orientation, which complicates putative decoding strategies. We discuss the challenges associated with establishing a neural code at the somatosensory periphery, where afferents are exquisitely sensitive and nearly deterministic.",nan; RAPIDLY ADAPTING MECHANORECEPTORS; METRIC-SPACE ANALYSIS; VISUAL-CORTEX; CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS; STIMULUS ORIENTATION; FLUTTER-VIBRATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HUMAN HAND; PRECISION; PERCEPTION

Nuclei involved in representation and regulation of the organism's internal state contain CB, whereas those involved in the representation of the external environment and the representation or execution of externally directed actions contain only PV. Moreover, our findings indicate that different nuclei known as components of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) contain either CB or PV or both, suggesting that this system in primates operates with both CB and PV. In line with previously reported findings, we also found that unmyelinated pathways contain only CB, whereas myelinated pathways contain PV. Distribution of CB and PV in the macaque brainstem follows a pattern comparable to, but in some instances significantly different than, the pattern previously reported in the rat. We argue that the nonoverlapping distribution of CB and PV among different structures of the brainstem might reflect underlying differences in the physiological, anatomic, and perhaps phylogenetic properties of these structures. Considering our recent findings of selective vulnerability of brainstem structures to Alzheimer's disease, the present data suggest that the majority of macaque brainstem nuclei that contain CB are vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangles in humans. By contrast, only few nuclei that contain PV exhibit pathologic changes. Some of these nuclei are affected with a high number of neuritic plaques without ever developing neurofibrillary tangles.",brain; myelin; primate; evolution; calcium; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; LAMINA-I NEURONS; INTRALAMINAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY-MATTER; PONTINE PARABRACHIAL AREA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PHA-L

It has been disputed whether visual experience is necessary for the formation of ocular dominance columns. To settle this issue, fetal monkeys were delivered prematurely by Caesarean section at embryonic day 157 (E157), 8 d before the end of normal gestation, To avoid light exposure, the Caesarean section and all subsequent feedings and procedures were done in absolute darkness, using infrared night-vision goggles. Tritiated proline was injected into the right eye 1 d after delivery (E158). One week later at postnatal age 0 (P0), the equivalent of a full-term pregnancy (E165/P0), alternate sections of unfolded and flattened visual cortex were prepared for autoradiography or cytochrome oxidase (CO). All three newborns studied at E165/P0 had well segregated ocular dominance columns organized into the characteristic mosaic present in adults. In the upper layers, a mature pattern of CO patches (also known as blobs or puffs) was visible, aligned with the ocular dominance columns in layer IVc. Every other row of patches in layers II,III was labeled by [H-3]proline, In V2, a distinct system of alternating thick-pale-thin-pale CO stripes was present. These findings indicate that stimulation of the retina by light is not necessary for the development of columnar systems in the visual cortex.

In controls, cholinergic innervation of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus was distributed heterogeneously in densely labelled patches surrounded by less heavily stained matrix. In patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, the density of choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 75% in the matrix and 60% in the patches. The number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cell bodies decreased by 84% in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, but more moderately (-33%) in the substantia innominata. In patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type, choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 34% in the matrix, but 46% in the patches. Choline acetyltransferase-labelled cell bodies were spared in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, whereas severe loss (-80%) was observed in the substantia innominata. These results suggest that cholinergic innervation of mediodorsal nucleus matrix derives mainly from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and mediodorsal nucleus patches from the substantia innominata.

However, the postnatal development of the amygdala is not easily explored at the cellular level in humans. Here we performed a stereological analysis of the macaque monkey amygdala in order to characterize the cellular changes underlying its normal structural development in primates. The lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei exhibited the same developmental pattern, with a large increase in volume between birth and 3 months of age, followed by slower growth continuing beyond 1 year of age. In contrast, the medial nucleus was near adult size at birth. At birth, the volume of the central nucleus was half of the adult value; this nucleus exhibited significant growth even after 1 year of age. Neither neuronal soma size, nor neuron or astrocyte numbers changed during postnatal development. In contrast, oligodendrocyte numbers increased substantially, in parallel with an increase in amygdala volume, after 3 months of age. At birth, the paralaminar nucleus contained a large pool of immature neurons that gradually developed into mature neurons, leading to a late increase in the volume of this nucleus. Our findings revealed that distinct amygdala nuclei exhibit different developmental profiles and that the amygdala is not fully mature for some time postnatally. We identified different periods during which pathogenic factors might lead to the abnormal development of distinct amygdala circuits, which may contribute to different human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with alterations of amygdala structure and functions.

Although many anatomical and physiological studies suggest a role for the PPTN in the control of conditioned behavior and associative learning, the detailed characteristics of saccade- and visual-related activities of PPTN neurons remain unclear. We recorded the activity of PPTN neurons in monkeys (Macaca fuscata ) during visually guided saccade tasks, and examined the response properties of saccade- and visual-related activities such as time course, direction selectivity and contextual modulation. Saccade-related activity occurred either during saccade execution or after saccade end. The preferred directions of the neuronal activity were biased toward the contralateral and upward sides. Half of the saccade-related neurons showed activity modulation only for task saccades and not for spontaneous saccades outside the task. Visually-responsive neurons responded with short latencies. Some responded to the appearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally selective manner, and others responded to both the appearance and disappearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally non-selective manner. Many of these neurons exhibited distinct visual responses to the appearance of two different stimuli presented under different stages of the task, whereas a population of the neurons responded equally to the disappearance of the two stimuli. Thus, many PPTN neurons exhibited context-dependent activity related to the visuomotor events, consistent with a role in controlling conditioned behavior.",brainstem; cholinergic neuron; Macaca fuscata; Parkinson's disease; visuomotor control; CONDITIONED MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CENTRAL THALAMUS

However, the effect of fetal irradiation on cognitive functions that are vulnerable in schizophrenia (e.g., working memory) has not been examined. Methods: Four fetally irradiated macaque monkeys (FIMs) and four age-matched controls (CONs) were tested as juveniles (12-30 months) and again as adults (similar to 5 years) on delayed spatial response (DR), a working memory task that is dependent on intact prefrontal cortical circuitry. Results: As juveniles, seven of eight monkeys learned DR; one FIM refused to test. Performance in the two groups was not different. As adults, only one FIM achieved criterion on DR. Three of four FIMs did not reach criterion at the 0-sec delay interval of the DR task, whereas all four CONs mastered DR at the maximum tested delay of 10 sec. FIMs completed fewer DR test sessions compared with CONs. In contrast, all FIMs and three of four CONs learned an associative memory task, visual pattern discrimination. Conclusions: Fetal exposure to irradiation resulted in an adult-onset cognitive impairment in the working memory domain that is relevant to understanding the developmental etiology of schizophrenia.",Attention; neurodevelopment; prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia; thalamus; working memory; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; WORKING-MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEYS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYMPTOMS; LESIONS; RISK

Here, we extend this work by estimating the time course of fMRI signal changes in the cortical and subcortical regions found to exhibit evidence for task-related activation. Our results indicate that there are separate loci of signal changes in the thalamus (dorsomedial and pulvinar) that exhibit notable differences in times of onset, peak and return to baseline of signal changes. The signal changes in the pulvinar demonstrate the slowest transients of all the cortical and subcortical regions we examined. Evaluation of cortical regions demonstrated salient differences as well, with the signal changes in Brodmann area 6 (BA6) rising, peaking, and returning to baseline earlier than those detected in other regions. We conclude that BA6 mediates early designation or refinement of search criteria, and that the pulvinar may be involved in the binding of feature stimuli for an integrated object memory.",semantic memory; thalamus; fMRI; TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; VERB GENERATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; KNOWLEDGE; ACTIVATION; BINDING
