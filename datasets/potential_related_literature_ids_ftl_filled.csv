Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus.",C1V1; ChR2; motor cortex; motor thalamus; optogenetics; single unit recording; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; FINE-STRUCTURE; RELAY NUCLEI

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.

Anterograde and retrograde labeling patterns in the thalamus were charted and individual labeled axons traced in continuous serial sections. Both anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus was extensive, spanning several millimeters mediolaterally and including ventral lateral, ventral anterior, centromedian, and centrolateral nuclei. Paracentral, mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and medial pulvinar nuclei were also labeled. Two basic types of corticothalamic axons were identified: small to medium-width, type 1 axons that formed large terminal fields with small boutons, and thick, type 2 axons that formed small terminal fields with large boutons. Within each group, subtypes were identified based on specific features of the axons and terminals: two subtypes of type 1 axons and four subtypes of type 2 axons. The results revealed multiple modes of corticothalamic connectivity: sparsely distributed type I axons, dense plexuses of type 1 axons, type 2 axon terminal fields either singly or in clusters, and mixed plexuses of type 1 and type 2 axons. Only some cells in the plexuses were retrogradely labeled; some plexuses did not contain any labeled neurons, and many retrogradely labeled neurons were in the regions devoid of anterograde labeling. These connectivity patterns differed between thalamic nuclei. The results revealed much more complex relationships between M1 and thalamus than were previously thought to exist. It is suggested that this connectivity is neither of exclusively a feedback nature nor perfectly reciprocal but is subserved by a multitude of channels, most likely originating from different populations of cortical neurons, and feeding into a variety of functionally different neuronal networks, with each processing specific information.

(1990). HRP was injected into various regions of the cortex in different animals and hemispheres (see Fig. 1), and plots were made of the retrogradely stained thalamic projection neurons. The thalamocortical projection is virtually identical in both rodent species. It is topological throughout in that nearby cortical injections label nearby, though overlapping cell groups in the thalamus. Cortical injections in a rostro-caudal progression labelled thalamic projection zones on top of each other, layered like tiles on a roof or fish scales, beginning in the rostromedial and ending in the caudo-dorsal thalamus. The progression vector of thalamic zones projecting successively from more rostral to more caudal cortical zones is twisted and turns from a predominantly mediolateral direction in the anterior thalamus to an essentially ventro-dorsal direction in the posterior thalamus (Figs. 8 and 9). In the marmoset, the thalamo-cortical topography follows the same topological rule, with the exception of the lateral geniculate body which is translocated latero-ventrally and separated from the rest of the thalamus as in all primates. This suggests a general thalamo-cortical mapping rule common to all mammals which can be related to gradients and timing of cell birth in the thalamus. It is proposed that this mapping rule is the consequence of successive appositions of neurons in the medio-ventral thalamus during ontogenetic development.",THALAMOCORTICAL TOPOGRAPHY; TOPOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION; MARMOSET; COMPARATIVE ANATOMY; RODENTS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; THALAMO-CORTICAL PROJECTION; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; MOTOR CORTEX

Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and different parts of the prefrontal cortex are essential in cognitive processes, such as learning and adaptive decision-making. Cortico-thalamocortical interactions involving other dorsal thalamic nuclei, including the anterior thalamus and pulvinar, also influence these cognitive processes. Our work, and that of others, indicates a crucial influence of these interdependent cortico-thalamocortical neural networks that contributes actively to the processing of information within the cortex. Each of these thalamic nuclei also receives potent subcortical inputs that are likely to provide additional influences on their regulation of cortical activity. Here, we highlight our current neuroscientific research aimed at establishing when cortico-MD thalamocortical neural network communication is vital within the context of a rapid learning and memory discrimination task. We are collecting evidence of MD-prefrontal cortex neural network communication in awake, behaving male rhesus macaques. Given the prevailing evidence, further studies are needed to identify both broad and specific mechanisms that govern how the MD, anterior thalamus and pulvinar cortico-thalamocortical interactions support learning, memory and decision-making. Current evidence shows that the MD (and the anterior thalamus) are crucial for frontotemporal communication, and the pulvinar is crucial for frontoparietal communication. Such work is crucial to advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical and physiological bases of these brain functions in humans. In turn, this might offer avenues to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the cognitive deficits often observed in many debilitating neurological disorders and diseases and in neurodegeneration.",anterior thalamus; behaviour; decision making; mediodorsal thalamus; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; prefrontal cortex; pulvinar; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PULVINAR INACTIVATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MEDIAL THALAMUS; LESIONS; AMYGDALA; PROJECTIONS; SELECTION; DISCONNECTION

The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation. The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions. Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere-the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated. There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion. This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere. The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric nystagmus or perceived body motion. Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways. Furthermore, the normal interaction between the two sensory systems-the vestibular and the visual-appears to be impaired.",vestibular system; thalamic lesion; PET; imaging; thalamo-cortical system; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; CALORIC STIMULATION; HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE; GALVANIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL PROJECTION

Glutamatergic inputs to these cells arise predominantly from corticothalamic (in both basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving ventral motor thalamic territories; BGMT and CBMT, respectively) and cerebellothalamic terminals (in CBMT). In Parkinson's disease patients and animal models, neuronal activity is abnormal within both BGMT and CBMT. Historically, such motor thalamic dysregulation has been largely attributed to changes in inhibitory tone from the basal ganglia output nuclei, ignoring the potential role of other thalamic inputs in such processes, particularly within the CBMT, which is largely devoid of direct basal ganglia afferents. We have recently reported changes in the abundance and structural morphology of corticothalamic terminals in BGMT of parkinsonian monkeys. In this study, we assessed potential changes in the prevalence of cortical (vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive, vGluT1-positive) and subcortical (vGluT2-positive) glutamatergic inputs in contact with GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CBMT of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. Our findings revealed that interneurons represent a major target of both sets of glutamatergic terminals. In both BGMT and CBMT of control and parkinsonian monkeys, 29%-38% of total asymmetric axodendritic synapses (putative glutamatergic) were formed by vGluT1-positive terminals and 11%-17% of total vGluT1-positive terminals targeted dendrites of GABAergic interneurons.

They are highly expressed in brain and are believed to play an integral role in neural cellular responses to receptor activation. A role for ERKs has been postulated in Alzheimer's disease, where they have been implicated in phosphorylation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles. We explored the neuroanatomic distribution of ERK immunoreactivity in the rhesus monkey brain. The hippocampal formation, especially the messy fiber zone and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are the most heavily immunostained areas. Cerebral cortex is, in general, more intensely stained in the supragranular layers. The caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra contain more immunoreactivity than the claustrum, globus pallidus, or thalamus with the exception of midline thalamic structures. These results suggest a marked regional and laminar distribution of ERKs in the primate brain.",MAP KINASE; ERK; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY; RHESUS MONKEY; ALZHEIMERS DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TAU-PROTEIN; PHOSPHORYLATION; TYROSINE; INSULIN; FAMILY

We aimed to determine the somatotopy and morphological features of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL. Retrograde tracing studies revealed that whisker-related VL neurons were found relatively anterior and medial to those labeled following injection of retrograde tracer into hindpaw motor areas. Simultaneous injections of fluorescent microspheres in both cortical regions did not result in double-labeled neurons in VL. Quantitative analysis of dendritic and somatic morphologies did not reveal any differences between hindpaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons within VL. The morphology of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL is similar to those in other mammals and suggests that mouse can be used as a model system for studying thalamocortical transformations within the motor system as well as plasticity following sensory deprivation or enrichment.</.",thalamus; ventral lateral thalamus; whiskers; somatotopy; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; PROJECTION NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; RAT; INPUT; NUCLEUS; CAT; CONNECTIONS; PREMOTOR

Here, we placed anatomical tracers in multiple locations of PPC to reveal the origins and targets of thalamic connections of four PPC domains for different types of hindlimb, forelimb, or face movements. Thalamic connections of all four domains included nuclei of the motor thalamus, ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, as well as parts of the sensory thalamus, the anterior pulvinar, posterior and ventral posterior superior nuclei, consistent with the sensorimotor functions of PPC domains. PPC domains also projected to the thalamic reticular nucleus in a somatotopic pattern. Quantitative differences in the distributions of labeled neurons in thalamic nuclei suggested that connectional patterns of these domains differed from each other.",anatomical tracing; long-train stimulation; motor thalamus; primate; pulvinar; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; IPSILATERAL CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; COMPLEX MOVEMENTS; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; PULVINAR NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits.

These cortical subpopulations display different axonal outgrowth kinetics and innervate distinct thalamic nuclei in a temporal pattern determined by cortical layer identity and subclass specificity. Guidance by molecular cues, structural cues, and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to this development. There is a substantial rearrangement of the corticofugal connectivity outside the thalamus at the border of and within the reticular thalamic nucleus, a region that shares some of the characteristics of the cortical subplate during development. The early transient circuits are not well understood, nor the extent to which this developmental pattern may be driven by peripheral sensory activity.

Detailed anatomy and functional connectivity patterns of the thalamocortical system are essential to understanding the cortical organization and pathophysiology of a wide range of thalamus-related neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The current study used resting-state fMRI to investigate the topography of the human thalamocortical system from a functional perspective. The thalamus-related cortical networks were identified by performing independent component analysis on voxel-based thalamic functional connectivity maps across a large group of subjects. The resulting functional brain networks were very similar to well-established resting-state network maps. Using these brain network components in a spatial regression model with each thalamic voxel's functional connectivity map, we localized the thalamic subdivisions related to each brain network. For instance, the medial dorsal nucleus was shown to be associated with the default mode, the bilateral executive, the medial visual networks; and the pulvinar nucleus was involved in both the dorsal attention and the visual networks. These results revealed that a single nucleus may have functional connections with multiple cortical regions or even multiple functional networks, and may be potentially related to the function of mediation or modulation of multiple cortical networks. This observed organization of thalamocortical system provided a reference for studying the functions of thalamic sub-regions.

Thalamocortical neurons in most of these nuclei are modulated by the affective and cognitive signals which funnel through the basal ganglia. We review how PFC-connected thalamic nuclei likely contribute to all aspects of cognitive control: from the processing of information on internal states and goals, facilitating its interactions with mnemonic information and learned values of stimuli and actions, to their influence on high-level cognitive processes, attentional allocation and goaldirected behavior. This includes contributions to transformations such as rule-to-choice (parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus), value-to-choice (magnocellular mediodorsal nucleus), mnemonic-to-choice (anteromedial nucleus) and sensory-to-choice (medial pulvinar). Common mechanisms appear to be thalamic modulation of cortical gain and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. The anatomy also implies a unique role for medial PFC in modulating processing in thalamocortical circuits involving other orbital and lateral PFC regions. We further discuss how cortico-basal ganglia circuits may provide a mechanism through which PFC controls cortico-cortical functional connectivity.",Cognitive control; Prefrontal cortex; Thalamus; Mediodorsal nucleus; Ventroanterior nucleus; Intralaminar nuclei; Anteromedial nucleus; Pulvinar; Thalamocortical; Corticothalamic; Basal ganglia; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; OCULOMOTOR DELAYED-RESPONSES; LATERAL MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; MEDIAL PULVINAR CONNECTIONS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; CM-PF COMPLEX

However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9-17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

MMN is thought to represent a comparison of the features of the present stimulus versus a mnemonic template formed by the prior stimuli. METHODS: We used concurrent thalamic and primary auditory cortical (A1) laminar recordings in 7 macaques to evaluate the relative contributions of core (lemniscal) and matrix (nonlemniscal) thalamic afferents to MMN generation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that deviance-related activity is observed mainly in matrix regions of auditory thalamus, MMN generators are most prominent in layer 1 of cortex as opposed to sensory responses that activate layer 4 first and sequentially all cortical layers, and MMN is elicited independent of the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles. Consistent with prior reports, MMN-related thalamocortical activity was strongly inhibited by ketamine.

However, injections in the motor area resulted in retrograde and anterograde labelling of nuclei in both the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus. These nuclei included the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the intralaminar nuclei (ILN), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and midline nuclei. Large unilateral injections located mainly laterally in the thalamus labelled cells, contralaterally, in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus but never in VL, ILN and MD. The present results confirm previously described bilateral thalamocortical projections from the VL to the somatosensorimotor area in this species (Regidor and Divac, Brain Behav. Evol., 39, 265 - 269, 1992) and in addition demonstrate that (i) bilateral thalamocortical projections are established preferentially with the motor area, (ii) several nuclei are involved in such connections, (iii) these connections are reciprocal and topographically organized, and (iv) labelling in the contralateral thalamus observed in the present study is not a result of transneuronal transport of the tracer through thalamothalamic connections.

Methods: Thirty minutes before intraperitoneal induction of SE by Coriaria lactone (CL), rhesus monkeys were treated with LEV (15 or 150 mg/kg) delivered intravenously as a single bolus. CL dose and epileptic behavior were recorded. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before and during the experiment. All rhesus monkeys were killed after 1-month video monitoring and processed for pathological investigation of neuronal injury, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. Results: No animal exhibited spontaneous seizures during 1-month video monitoring. Development of acute SE was significantly inhibited in the group given 150 mg/kg LEV, compared with controls and the 15 mg/kg LEV group. Delayed latency, reduction of SE duration, decreased cumulative time of tonic convulsions, slight severity of SE, and a high CL induction dose were observed in the high LEV dose group (p < 0.05). The EEG showed less frequent epileptic discharges in the group administered with 150 mg/kg LEV. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, ultrastructural examination, TUNEL and GFAP staining revealed serious damage, including neuron loss, swollen mitochondrion, and strong positivity for TUNEL in the hippocampus and thalamus of controls, whereas moderate damage in the group administered with 15 mg/kg LEV, and very mild damage in the 150 mg/kg LEV group. Gliosis was found in the hippocampus of controls, not in the LEV groups and normal rhesus monkey.

In three macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we observed up to five finger-like protrusions that emanated from the posterior pole of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extended posteriorly between the lateral pulvinar and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. These anomalous fingers measured up to 1.7 mm in length and contained dense accumulations of neurons and glia. The fingers received a direct retinal input from the contralateral eye indicating that they were part of the LGN rather than of other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In order to determine with which subcompartment(s) of the LGN the fingers were associated (parvocellular, magnocellular, or intercalated layers), we examined the immunochemical properties and size of neurons in the fingers and LGN subcompartments. We concluded that the fingers were not associated with the intercalated layers, since neurons in the fingers did not stain with an antibody to calbindin-D28k, whereas intercalated neurons stained intensely with this antibody. In addition, neurons located in the fingers were significantly smaller than those found in the magnocellular layers but were not significantly different in size from neurons in the parvocellular layers. We therefore consider that the fingers are an anomaly of the parvocellular subcompartment of the LGN. Interestingly, in two of the three cases with anomalous fingers, we also observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae, suggesting that these two anomalies were related. In five additional animals, however, we observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae without anomalous fingers. Thus, if there are common mechanisms underlying the development of both anomalous fingers and subsidiary layers, our data indicate that they do not always result in the concomitant expression of both anomalies.","thalamus; lamination; retinal projections; (primates) monkey, Macaca fascicularis; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; MONOCULAR ENUCLEATION; RETINAL PROJECTIONS; PULVINAR NUCLEUS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-SYSTEM; PATTERNS; IMMUNOREACTIVITY"

Here we demonstrate temporally induced elevation of visual responsiveness in cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cat and monkey following a period of high intensity (elevated contrast) stimulation. This augmentation is seen in 40-70% (monkey-cat) of cells tested and of all subtypes. Peaking at similar to 3 min following the period of intense stimulation, it can last for 10-12 min and can be repeated and summed in time. Furthermore, it is dependent on corticofugal input, is seen even when high contrast stimuli of orthogonal orientation are used and therefore results from a/any prior increase in activity in the retino-geniculo-striate pathway. We suggest that this reflects a general mechanism for control of visual responsiveness; both a flexible and dynamic means of changing effectiveness of thalamic activity as visual input changes, but also a mechanism which is an emergent property of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop.",context dependent; contrast mediated; cortico-geniculate; response enhancement; thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; RABBIT FOLLOWING STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; AUGMENTING RESPONSES; LASTING POTENTIATION; PERFORANT PATH; DENTATE AREA; CORTEX

Area 46 has complex connections with somatosensory, visual, visuomotor, motor, and limbic systems and a key role in cognition, which frequently declines with age. An important question is what alterations might account for this decline. We are nowhere near having a complete answer, but as will be shown in this review, it is now evident that there is no single underlying cause. There is no significant loss of cortical neurons and although there are a few senile plaques in rhesus monkey cortex, their frequency does not correlate with cognitive decline. However, as discussed in this review, the following do correlate with cognitive decline. Loss of white matter has been proposed to result in some disconnections between parts of the central nervous system and changes in the structure of myelin sheaths reduce conduction velocity and the timing in neuronal circuits. In addition, there are reductions in the inputs to cortical neurons, as shown by regression of dendritic trees, loss of dendritic spines and synapses, and alterations in transmitters and receptors. These factors contribute to alterations in the intrinsic and network physiological properties of cortical neurons. As more details emerge, it is to be hoped that effective interventions to retard cognitive decline can be proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI

This study attempts to identify the correlation between thalamic relay cells and functional activity evoked in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) of cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys. Wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA:HRP) was iontophoretically injected into physiologically determined sites in the somatosensory cortex, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminals in corresponding somatosensory thalamic regions. In the same animals, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) experiments were carried out 2 days later, using the somatic stimuli identified as best exciting the cortical neurons. Stimulation to the limbs produced crescent-shaped clusters of metabolic label arranged in a somatotopically organized fashion in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Following WGA:HRP injections into area 3b, the stimulus-evoked 2DG label was colocalized with the retrograde and anterograde tracer. This finding suggests that the location of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity can be predicted by the presence of transported WGA:HRP clusters.",SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; WGA-HRP; 2-DEOXYGLUCOSE; CYTOCHROME OXIDASE; THALAMIC ROD; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VENTROBASAL COMPLEX; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; THALAMUS; HISTOCHEMISTRY; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTION; MACAQUE

In this paper this issue is addressed by investigating the connectivity pattern of a brain structure with many, well characterized structural connections, namely the thalamus. Diffusion-weighted and resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected in a group of 38 healthy participants. Probabilistic tractography was performed to parcellate the thalamus into regions structurally connected to different cortical areas. The resulting regions were used as seeds for seed-based analysis of RS fMRI data. The tractographic parcellation was thus cross-validated against functional connectivity data by evaluating the overlap between the functional and structural thalamo-cortical connections originating from the parcellated regions. Our data show only a partial overall correspondence between structural and functional connections, in the same group of healthy individuals, thus suggesting that the two approaches provide complementary and not overlapping information. Future studies are warranted to extend the results we obtained in the thalamus to other structures, and to confirm that the mechanisms behind functional connectivity are more complex than just expressing structural connectivity.",Resting-state fMRI; Tractography; Diffusion; Thalamo-cortical connections; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NETWORKS; MRI; SEGMENTATION; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL

Neurosurgeons mostly use the stereotactic atlas of Schaltenbrand with Hassler's nomenclature of the thalamus. Neuroanatomists use different nomenclatures for the primate thalamus. The cytoarchitectonic definition of nuclei is difficult in the motor thalamus. and it would be best to define the nuclei based on their subcortical afferents. However, tracing studies are not available in humans. Thus, human thalamic nomenclature is based entirely on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and transfer of knowledge by analogy from monkey to man. Problems arise when trying to transfer the detailed knowledge from monkey to the human brain. By doing so, different authors have come to different conclusions concerning the subcortical afferents of Hassler's motor nuclei, which inevitably leads to confusion when attempting neurophysiological interpretations of the surgical data. The present review draws attention to the discrepancies and open questions in the literature. There is a need to better define the limits of the sensory and cerebellar afferent receiving thalamic nuclei as well as those of the cerebellar and pallidal afferent receiving territories in humans.

After tracer injections in the mediodorsal nuclei on either side, neurons were retrogradely labeled in all the areas of the contralateral prefrontal cortex in which ipsilateral labeling was also observed. Contralateral corticothalamic cells accounted for 15% of the labeled neurons in the orbital and agranular insular areas, while their proportion was lower (3%) in the anterior cingulate cortex. Up to 70% of the contralateral cortical neurons were double labeled by bilateral injections in the mediodorsal nuclei. At the electron microscopic level, unilateral injections of biotinylated dextran-amine in the orbitofrontal cortex resulted in anterograde labeling of small terminals and a few large boutons in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus, while only small boutons were identified contralaterally. The diameter of postsynaptic dendritic profiles contacted by labeled small cortical endings was significantly larger in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus than contralaterally. These findings demonstrate that dense contralateral cortical projections to the mediodorsal nucleus derive from the orbital and agranular insular areas, and that crossed corticothalamic afferents are mostly formed by collaterals of the ipsilateral connections. Our observations also point out the heterogeneity of corticothalamic boutons in the rat mediodorsal nucleus and morphological differences in the synaptic organization of prefrontal fibers innervating the two sides, indicating that ipsilateral cortical afferents may be more proximally distributed than crossed cortical fibers on dendrites of mediodorsal neurons.

The results indicate that corticothalamic connections of the STS in general reciprocate thalamocortical connections. The cortex of the upper bank of the STS-multimodal areas TPO and PGa-projects to four major thalamic targets: the pulvinar complex, the mediodorsal nucleus, the limitans-suprageniculate nucleus, as well as intralaminar nuclei. Within the pulvinar complex, the main projections of the upper bank of the STS are directed to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Rostral upper bank regions tend to project caudally and medially within the PM nucleus, caudal upper bank regions, more laterally and ventrally. The mid-portion of the upper bank tends to occupy the central sector of the PM nucleus. There are also relatively minor projections from upper bank regions to the lateral pulvinar (PL) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei. In contrast to the upper bank, the projections from the lower bank are directed primarily to the pulvinar complex, with only minor projections to intralaminar nuclei. The rostral portion of the lower bank projects mainly to caudal and medial regions of the PM nucleus, whereas the caudal lower bank projects predominantly to the lateral PM nucleus, and also to the PL, PO, and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei. The mid-portion of the lower bank projects mainly to central and lateral portions of the PM nucleus, and also to the PI and PL nuclei. The rostral depth of the STS projects mainly to the PM nucleus, with only minor connections to the PO, PI, and PL nuclei. The mid-portion of multimodal area TPO of the upper bank, areas TPO2 and TPO3, projects preferentially to the central sector of the PM nucleus.

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.",clustering coefficient; characteristic path length; transmission coefficient; modularity; small-world; brain networks; SMALL-WORLD; ORGANIZATION; BRAIN

This study aimed to investigate the functional connectivity of the thalamus in youth with ADHD, using both anatomically and functionally defined thalamic seed regions. Methods:Resting-state functional MRIs obtained from the publicly available ADHD-200 database were analyzed. Thalamic seed regions were defined functionally and anatomically based on Yeo's 7 resting-state-network parcellation atlas and the AAL3 atlas, respectively. Functional connectivity maps of the thalamus were extracted, and thalamocortical functional connectivity was compared between youth with and without ADHD. Results:Using the functionally defined seeds, significant group differences in thalamocortical functional connectivity and significant negative correlations between thalamocortical connectivity and ADHD symptom severity were observed within the boundaries of corresponding large-scale networks. However, in the analysis using the anatomically defined thalamic seeds, significant group differences in connectivity and significant positive correlations were observed outside the expected boundaries of major anatomic projections. The thalamocortical connectivity originating from the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus was significantly correlated with age in youth with ADHD. Limitations:The small sample size and smaller proportion of girls were limiting factors. Conclusion:Thalamocortical functional connectivity based on the intrinsic network architecture of the brain appears to be clinically relevant in ADHD. The positive association between thalamocortical functional connectivity and ADHD symptom severity may represent a compensatory process recruiting an alternative neural network.",nan; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; ORGANIZATION; THALAMUS; COMPENSATION; NETWORKS; NUCLEUS

Unbiased estimates were selectively obtained for the parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and interlaminar plus superficial (I + S) layers of the nucleus. The dLGN had a mean volume of 56.5 mm(3), and contained on average 1.79 million neurons. The P layers contributed 64% of the volume and 83% of the neurons in the dLGN; the corresponding proportions for the other layers were 13% and 9% (M), and 23% and 8% (I + S). Interindividual variability was large for neuron counts, which varied within a two-fold range, and lower for volume estimates.

According to Hassler, this area includes ventro-oralis posterior (Vop) and ventral intermedius (Vim) nuclei, although some investigators believe that Vop is associated with the pallidothalamic pathway. We sought to correlate our experimental data on distribution of nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents to the monkey thalamus with Hassler's motor thalamic parcelations. We concluded that Hassler's parcelations retained their value, although some adjustments were needed to relate them to the current neuroanatomic data; particularly, the cerebellothalamic zone that represents the monkey ventral lateral nucleus (VL) corresponds topographically to Hassler's Vop, Vim, and most of Voi. Electron microscopic tracing studies have shown very complex circuitry in this region of the monkey thalamus, as the cerebellar and cortical afferents innervating it are engaged in complex synapses with thalamocortical projection neurons, and this interaction is strongly modulated by local circuit neurons and the input from the reticular thalamic nucleus, which are both inhibitory and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic. Spinothalamic afferents also reach the VL. but this input is less studied in the monkey. The circuitry subserving the activity of thalamocortical projection neurons in the VL should be considered while interpreting the functional data obtained in stereotactic surgery.

Recent work in macaques suggests that the thalamus conveys corollary discharge information of upcoming saccades passing from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye field. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the thalamus in humans by assessing the effect of thalamic lesions on the processing of corollary discharge information. Thirteen patients with selective thalamic lesions and 13 healthy age-matched control subjects performed a saccadic double-step task in which retino-spatial dissonance was induced, i.e. the retinal vector of the second target and the movement vector of the second saccade were different. Thus, the subjects could not rely on retinal information alone, but had to use corollary discharge information to correctly perform the second saccade. The amplitudes of first and second saccades were significantly smaller in patients than in controls. Five thalamic lesion patients showed unilateral deficits in using corollary discharge information, as revealed by asymmetries compared with the other patients and controls. Three patients with lateral thalamic lesions including the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) were impaired contralaterally to the side of damage and one patient with a lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) was impaired ipsilaterally to the lesion. The largest asymmetry was found in a patient with a bilateral thalamic lesion. The results provide evidence for a thalamic involvement in the processing of corollary discharge information in humans, with a potential role of both the VL and MD nuclei.",saccades; thalamus; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; DOUBLE-STEP SACCADES; PARIETAL CORTEX; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; VISUAL SPACE; LESIONS; MOVEMENTS

TrkC-like immunoreactivity was widespread and consisted primarily of varicose fibers. The most dense populations of fibers were in the basal forebrain (in the cholinergic cell groups Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4), in the raphe complex throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and in the locus coeruleus. Other fibers were present in the thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray matter of the midbrain, dorsal midline of the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The only neuronal cell bodies with consistent labeling were located in the lateral hypothalamus. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum showed variable labeling. Specific labeling of varicosities and cell bodies was abolished by omission of the primary antiserum or by preabsorption with the TrkC peptide antigen. We conclude that TrkC-like immunoreactivity can be detected in a wide variety of subcortical locations in the adult rhesus monkey. Labeling was particularly prominent in the vicinity of the major cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic nuclei, known from other studies to be vulnerable in the ageing brain. This suggests that the ligand for TrkC, neurotrophin-3, may persist as a survival factor for critical neurons into adulthood. (C) 1998 IBRO.

Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two alpha-, two beta- and one gamma- or delta-subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits alpha 1, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were found in all layers, alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, all three beta-subunits, gamma 2, and delta. Subunits alpha 3 and alpha 5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2, and delta were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2, whereas alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 1, and gamma 2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, and delta, and in the central amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit alpha 3-IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.","antibody alpha 1 (BD24); RRID:AB_2108828, ab alpha 2; RRID:AB_2827793, ab alpha 3; RRID:AB_2827797, ab alpha 4; RRID:AB_2827798, ab alpha 5; RRID:AB_2827799, ab beta 1; RRID:AB_2827800, ab beta 2; RRID:AB_2827801, ab beta 3; RRID:AB_2827802, ab gamma 2; RRID:AB_2827803, ab delta; RRID:AB_2827804, ab GAD67; RRID:AB_2278725, ab NeuN; RRID:AB_2278725; amygdala; basal ganglia; benzodiazepine; GABA(A) receptor subunits; goat biotinylated anti-rabbit ab; RRID:AB_2336810; horse anti-mouse ab; RRID:AB_2336811; immunohistochemistry; monkey; primate; thalamus; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; MESSENGER-RNAS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES; LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION"

Here, we demonstrate by combined retrograde tracing and immunocytochemistry that at least some of these are pulvinocortical relay neurons, and further report several distinctive features. First, in contrast with non-giant relay neurons, the giant neurons are often solitary and isolated from a main projection focus. The question thus arises of whether their cortical projections may be non-reciprocal or otherwise distinctive. Second, these neurons are positive for GluR4; but third, they are otherwise neurochemically heterogeneous, in that about one-third are positive for both parvalbumin (PV) and CB. Presumably, these subpopulations are also functionally heterogeneous. These results provide further evidence for the idea of multiple, interleaved organizations within the pulvinar; and they imply that thalamocortical projections are more disparate than has yet been appreciated. Finally, we found that giant CB+ neurons have a distinctive meshwork of large, PV+ terminations, prominent at the first dendritic branch point.

Here we report on the distribution of response modalities to 487 intraoperative thalamic stimulations performed in 24 neurogenic pain (NP), 17 parkinsonian (PD) and 10 neuropsychiatric (Npsy) patients. Threshold responses were subdivided into somatosensory, motor and affective, and compared between medial (central lateral nucleus) and lateral (ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral medial) thalamic nuclei and between patients groups. Major findings were as follows: in the medial thalamus, evoked responses were for a large majority (95%) somatosensory in NP patients, 47% were motor in PD patients, and 54% affective in Npsy patients. In the lateral thalamus, a much higher proportion of somatosensory (83%) than motor responses (5%) was evoked in NP patients, while the proportion was reversed in PD patients (69% motor vs. 21% somatosensory). These results provide the first evidence for functional cross-modal changes in lateral and medial thalamic nuclei in response to intraoperative stimulations in different functional disorders. This extensive functional reorganization sheds new light on wide-range plasticity in the adult human thalamocortical system. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Each radiotracer is a propylsulfonamide-containing benzamide and was labeled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18. [C-11]CMPyPB was synthesized by the alkylation of a 3-hydroxypyridine precursor using [C-11]MeI, and [F-18]MK-6577 was synthesized by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction using a 2-chloropyridine precursor. Each tracer shows good uptake into rhesus monkey brain with the expected distribution of highest uptake in the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum and lower uptake in the striatum and gray matter of the frontal cortex. In vivo blockade and chase studies of [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal and reversible binding. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal in both rhesus monkey and human brain slices and a distribution consistent with the in vivo results and those reported in the literature. In vivo metabolism studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that only more-polar metabolites are formed for each tracer. Of these two tracers, [F-18]MK-6577 was more extensively characterized and is a promising clinical positron emission tomography tracer for imaging GlyT1 and for measuring GlyT1 occupancy of therapeutic compounds.

However, the mechanisms through which these therapeutic benefits are mediated remain poorly understood. Although the regulatory role of mGluR5 on glutamatergic transmission has been examined in various basal ganglia nuclei, very little is known about the localization and function of mGluR5 in the ventral motor and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the main targets of basal ganglia output in mammals. Thus, we used immuno-electron microscopy to map the cellular and subcellular localization of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) in the ventral motor and caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, using double immuno-electron microscopy, we examined the subsynaptic localization of mGluR5 in relation to cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Four major conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, mGluR1a and mGluR5 are expressed postsynaptically on the plasma membrane of dendrites of projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving regions of the ventral motor thalamus and in CM. Second, the plasma membrane-bound mGluR5 immunoreactivity is preferentially expressed perisynaptically at the edges of cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Third, the mGluR5 immunoreactivity is more strongly expressed in the lateral than the medial tiers of CM, suggesting a preferential association with thalamocortical over thalamostriatal neurons in the primate CM. Overall, mGluR5 is located to subserve powerful modulatory role of cortical and subcortical glutamatergic transmission in the primate ventral motor thalamus and CM.",Globus pallidus; Cerebellum; Rhesus monkey; mGluR; Parkinson's disease; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; DOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; BASAL-GANGLIA; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

The sections through the anterior part of a rhesus monkey brain (250 sections stained for myeloarchitecture and 250 sections stained for cytoarchitecture) were digitally photographed, three-dimensionally aligned to each other, and three-dimensionally reconstructed. For three-dimensional registration of the sections rigid transformations were applied with the Euclidian distance as fit criterion. Afterwards, the derived volume was used for manual segmentation of several central structures of the monkey brain (caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, ventricles, cortex, hippocampus. amygdala, etc.).

Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem, These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.",pulvinar; bursts; corticothalamic; drivers; modulators; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; VISUAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

Layers, loops and the emergence of fast synchronous rhythms","A large-scale computer model was constructed to gain insight into the structural basis for the generation of fast synchronous rhythms (20-60 Hz) in the thalamocortical system. The model consisted of 65 000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS

Lesions of the anterior thalamus in macaques produce impairments which resemble those seen after lesions of the fornix-mamillary pathway, which carries projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus, while lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, which receives inputs from frontal and temporal cortex, produce moderate impairments on a wider range of memory tasks. In the present study, we have made bilateral excitotoxic lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus, or both, in marmoset monkeys. Monkeys with lesions of both thalamic nuclei were severely impaired on retention and new learning of examples of the visuospatial conditional task, a task which is specifically impaired by lesions of the fornix or hippocampus. They were not impaired on performance of a visuovisual conditional task on which monkeys with hippocampal lesions are impaired, nor were they impaired on any visual discrimination task, including the concurrent discrimination task on which monkeys with temporal neocortical ablations are impaired. Monkeys with separate lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus were not impaired on any of these tasks. These results suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus and the anterior thalamus are both involved in processing the output of the hippocampal-fornix-thalamic circuit. Dense amnesia may result from damage to circuits additional to the temporal lobe efferents to either the anterior or the mediodorsal nuclei. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary of Review-Thalamic nuclei are composed of 5 major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions. Posterior choroidal lesions result in visual field deficits, variable sensory loss, weakness, dystonia, tremors, and occasionally amnesia and language impairment. Conclusions-These vascular syndromes reflect the reciprocal cerebral cortical-thalamic connections that have been interrupted and provide insights into the functional properties of the thalamus.",cerebral cortex; cognition; diaschisis; language; memory; thalamus; ARTERY TERRITORY INFARCTION; TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA; POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; MEDIAL PULVINAR NUCLEUS; PSYCHIC SELF-ACTIVATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

The main sources of thalamocortical inputs to the auditory cortex are the medial geniculate complex (MGC), medial pulvinar (PM), and several adjoining nuclei in the posterior thalamus. The distribution of inputs varies topographically by cortical area and thalamic nucleus, but in a manner that has not been fully characterized in primates. In this study, the thalamocortical connections of the lateral belt and parabelt were determined by placing retrograde tracer injections into various areas of these regions in the marmoset monkey. Both regions received projections from the medial (MGm) and posterodorsal (MGpd) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC); however, labeled cells in the anterodorsal (MGad) division were present only from injections into the caudal belt. Thalamic inputs to the lateral belt appeared to come mainly from the MGC, whereas the parabelt also received a strong projection from the PM, consistent with its position as a later stage of auditory cortical processing. The results of this study also indicate that the organization of the marmoset auditory cortex is similar to other primates. Anat Rec, 2012.

Thalamocortical inputs arise in parallel from four divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), which have regionally distinct projection patterns. These inputs terminate in layers IIIb and/or IV, and are assumed to be glutamatergic, although this has not been verified. In the present study, immunoreactivity (-ir) for the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2, was used to estimate the regional and laminar distribution of the glutamatergic thalamocortical projection in the macaque auditory cortex. Coronal sections containing auditory cortex were processed for VGluT2 and other markers concentrated in the thalamorecipient layers: cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and parvalbumin. Marker expression was studied with wide field and confocal microscopy. The main findings were: (1) VGkuT2-ir was highest in the core, intermediate in the belt, and sparse in the parabelt; (2) VGluT2-ir was concentrated in the neuropil of layers IIIb/IV in the core and layer IIIb in the belt; (3) VGluT2-ir matched regional and laminar expression of the other chemoarchitectonic markers. The results indicate that the glutamatergic thalamic projection to auditory cortex, as indexed by VGluT-2-ir, varies along the core-belt-parabelt axis in a manner that matches the gradients of other markers. These chemoarchitectonic features are likely to subserve regional differences in neuronal activity between regions of auditory cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the sensorimotor nuclei of the thalamus in humans using task-based fMRI at a field strength of 9.4T by assessing the individual subject-specific sensorimotor BOLD response during a combined active motor (finger-tapping) and passive sensory (tactile-finger) stimulation. We demonstrate that both tasks increase BOLD signal response in the lateral nuclei group (VPL, VA, VLa, and VLp), and in the pulvinar nuclei group (PuA, PuM, and PuL). Finger-tapping stimuli evokes a stronger BOLD response compared to the tactile stimuli, and additionally engages the intralaminar nuclei group (CM and Pf). In addition, our results demonstrate reproducible thalamic nuclei activation during motor and tactile stimuli.

One likely source is the central thalamus, which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Because the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye position signals arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, because the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye position signals in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye position signals in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye position signals were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye position signals to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that 2 distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye position signals from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways.

Small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons were microiontophoretically injected with biotin-dextran or biocytin and their labeled axons were individually reconstructed from serial horizontal sections immunostained for calbindin-D28k to delineate striatal patch/matrix compartments. Reconstruction of >40 axons shows that all Cg3 corticofugal fibers, including corticothalamic axons from layer VI, course through the patch network in the rostromedial sector of the striatum. Corticostriatal projections arise from two types of layer V cells: (i) long-range corticofugal neurons, whose main axons reach the brainstem and/or spinal cord, and (ii) neurons arborizing into both striatum and claustrum, either ipsi-. contra- or bilaterally. The axons of these two types of neurons arborize profusely in striatal patches and only sparsely in the matrix. Layer VI neurons do not arborize in the striatum but target principally the thalamus. The same corticothalamic axon can innervate the anterior, rostral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These findings support the concept that no corticofugal fiber system exists that is solely devoted to the striatum. They also shed new light on how neural information from prelimbic cortex is conveyed to various subcortical limbic structures in the rat.",nan; SENSORY-MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MACAQUE MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LAMINAR ORIGIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION

Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. Methods: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. Results: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. Conclusion: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGrNs of humans.

The cartographic method relied on the use of intracerebral, ventricular landmarks (CA: anterior commissure and CP: posterior commissure). The basal ganglia outlines, first drawn in transverse sections perpendicular to the CA-CP plane, were reconstructed on the horizontal and midsagittal planes. Maps from several individuals were superimposed and statistical variations studied. The results confirm that the length between the two CA and CP points is statistically greater (7%) in the Macaca mulatta than Macaca fascicularis but reveal considerable inter-individual differences. The closer a given nucleus is from a ventricular reference point, the more stable its outline. Superimpositions led to a statistical determination of the stereotaxic coordinates required to reach a given target center.

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PHA-L

Young are born after 26-28 days of gestation and do not open their eyes until around 140 days after birth. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin was injected in the visual thalamus in adults and in pouch young aged from 22 days after birth, just after thalamic axons first reach the visual cortex, to 118 days, when cortical lamination resembles the adult. From 22 to 65 days, the developing visual cortex consists of a marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP), and intermediate zone (IZ) including the superficial subplate (SP), subventricular zone, and ventricular zone. There is a thin compact cell zone (CCZ) at the top of the CP and below it a less densely packed region that increases in thickness with age. Retrogradely labelled cells in two bands were first seen at 40 days, one in the CCZ and the other at the base of the CP. Two bands of cells were seen at all subsequent times if the injection covered both LGNd and LP, and by 76 days, these cells were located within cytoarchitectonically recognizable layers V and VI. Anterograde label prior to 45 days was distributed densely and evenly throughout the IZ and the CP up to the CCZ. Label in MZ was first seen at 25 days and was substantial by 54 days. Anterograde label then became gradually reduced in the IZ, whereas in the CP it remained evenly and densely distributed until 82 days. At this age, coincident with the emergence of layer IV, label within the CP first showed variations in density and by 99 days was concentrated over layer IV and, to a lesser extent, over layer VI. By 118 days label resembled the adult after injections covering both LGNd and LP, with label concentrated in layer I, IV, and VI with a less dense projection to lower layer III and upper layer V. There is a relatively earlier initial ingrowth of axons into the visual cortex in the wallaby and throughout development thalamocortical axons appear to be more widely distributed in the depth of the visual cortex than has been demonstrated for placental mammals. They are densely distributed up to the thin CCZ of the CP long before lamination of the cortex emerges beneath this zone. Soon after retrogradely labelled cells are first seen, the two bands of these cells that project to the LGNd and LP and ultimately reside in layers V and VI are also located in the region below the CCZ occupied by thalamocortical afferents. The question arises as to whether there is a waiting period in the SP in the wallaby. If there is not, this may be a genuine difference with placental mammals or a result of the more sensitive technique used here to demonstrate thalamocortical afferents.",GENICULOCORTICAL; LAMINATION; SEGREGATION; MAMMALIAN; ANATOMY; RHESUS-MONKEY; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; MACROPUS-EUGENII; TAMMAR WALLABY; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; OCULAR DOMINANCE; ACCESSIBLE MODEL; CONNECTIONS; CATS

By using both passively and actively transported axonal tracers in fetal and postnatal ferrets, we have analyzed the development of projections from the cortex to a number of thalamic nuclei. We report that the projections of a cortical area to its corresponding thalamic nuclei follow highly cell-specific programs of development, Axons from cells in the deepest layers of the cerebral cortex (layer 6 and superficial subplate neurons) appear to grow very slowly and be delayed for several weeks in the cerebral white matter, reaching the thalamus over a protracted period, Neurons of layer 5, on the other hand, develop their projections much faster; despite being born after the neurons of deeper layers, layer 5 neurons are the first to extend their axons out of the cortical hemisphere and innervate the thalamus, Layer 5 projections are massive in the first postnatal weeks but may become partly eliminated later in development, being overtaken in number by layer 6 cells that constitute the major corticothalamic projection by adulthood. Layer 5 projections are area-specific from the outset and arise as collateral branches of axons directed to the brainstem and spinal cord. Our findings show that the early development of corticofugal connections is determined not by the sequence of cortical neurogenesis but by developmental programs specific for each type of projection neuron, In addition, they demonstrate that in most thalamic nuclei, layer 5 neurons (and not subplate or layer 6 neurons) establish the first descending projections from the cerebral cortex.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTION; THALAMUS; FERRET; AXONAL GROWTH; VISUAL CORTICAL-NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FERRET; AXONS; SUBPLATE; PATHWAYS; ESTABLISHMENT; CONNECTIVITY; GENESIS

Regional net accumulation rate constants were derived from kinetic (two-tissue compartment model with irreversible tracer trapping) and graphic (Patlak) analyses, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input. The kinetic data analysis showed that the rate constant for the transfer of [C-11]HTP into the brain (K-1) was higher than that for [C-11]AMT in the striatum and thalamus but was similar in other brain regions. The rate constant for tracer trapping (k(3)) was also higher for [C-11]HTP than for [C-11]AMT in the striatum (0.046 +/- 0.024 versus 0.019 +/- 0.006 min(-1)) and thalamus (0.039 +/- 0.013 versus 0.016 +/- 0.007 min(-1)). In agreement with previously reported regional HTP accumulation rates, the net accumulation rate constant (K-acc) for [C-11]HTP was also higher in these regions than in other brain regions; this is in contrast to the uniform distribution of [C-11]AMT Kacc values. This suggests that the regional net accumulation rates obtained with these two PET tracers will be of different magnitude, which might be related to the activity of each targeted enzyme.",biosynthesis; 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan; alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan; positron emission tomography; rhesus monkey; serotonin; METHYL-L-TRYPTOPHAN; SUB-CORTICAL STRUCTURES; IN-VIVO; AMINO-ACIDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SYNTHESIS RATES; 5-HT SYNTHESIS; PET; METABOLISM; KINETICS

Here, we present an approach that combines primate-optimized tissue sectioning and clearing with ultrahigh-speed fluorescence microscopy implementing improved volumetric imaging with synchronized on-the-fly-scan and readout technique, and is capable of completing whole-brain imaging of a rhesus monkey at 1 x 1x 2.5 mu m(3) voxel resolution within 100 h. We also developed a highly efficient method for long-range tracing of sparse axonal fibers in datasets numbering hundreds of terabytes. This pipeline, which we call serial sectioning and clearing, three-dimensional microscopy with semi-automated reconstruction and tracing (SMART), enables effective connectome-scale mapping of large primate brains. With SMART, we were able to construct a cortical projection map of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and identify distinct turning and routing patterns of individual axons in the cortical folds while approaching their arborization destinations.",nan; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TISSUE; VISUALIZATION; PROJECTIONS; HISTOLOGY; CIRCUITS; THALAMUS; SPEED

However, recent studies in the monkey have documented projections from MD to the more caudal, agranular regions of the frontal cortex, suggesting that the connections of MD may be characterized by a breadth of distribution and diversity of functional roles too great to be useful as a unifying and defining feature for a specific cortical territory. In this study, we placed tracer injections in the lateral divisions of MD in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the relative proportions of connections devoted to diverse regions of the frontal cortex (FC). Three different patterns of label were observed in the cortex, associated with different locations within lateral MD. We have designated these as the ventrolateral MD-arcuate FC circuit, having most label in areas 8 and 6; the caudoventral MD-dorsomedial FC circuit, having most label in areas 24 and presupplementary motor area (SMA); and the anterodorsal MD-anterior FC circuit, with the most label in areas 9, 46, 12, and 10. Only two of the nine cases injected in lateral MD were predominantly connected with the anterior FC. Thus, particular locales within lateral MD are connected with multiple, functionally diverse cortical regions, including several not classically recognized as prefrontal areas. This divergence may distinguish MD-frontocortical and reciprocal corticothalamic pathways from the largely segregated pathways arising from the other thalamic nuclei that are interconnected with the frontal cortex, such as those from the ventrolateral nuclear group.

Here, we describe a set of computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques. Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications. Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through more accurate computational models of DBS.",thalamus; high-field imaging; susceptibility weighted imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; fiber; tractography; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION; AFFINE REGISTRATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEFORMABLE ATLAS; MR-IMAGES; IRON

How the brain decides the timing of self-initiated movements remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways play this role, but the subcortical signals that determine movement timing have not been identified. The present study reports that a subset of thalamic neurons predicts the timing of self-initiated saccadic eye movements. When monkeys made a saccade in response to the fixation point ( FP) offset in the traditional memory saccade task, neurons in the ventrolateral and the ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus exhibited a gradual buildup of activity that peaked around the most probable time of the FP offset; however, neither the timing nor the magnitude of neuronal activity correlated with saccade latencies, suggesting that the brain is unlikely to have used this information to decide the times of saccades in the traditional memory saccade task. In contrast, when monkeys were required to make a self-timed saccade within a fixed time interval after an external cue, the same neurons again exhibited a strong buildup of activity that preceded saccades by several hundred milliseconds, showing a close correlation between the times of neuronal activity and the times of self-initiated saccades. The results suggest that neurons in the motor thalamus carry subjective time information, which is used by cortical networks to determine the timing of self-initiated saccades.",saccade; self-timing; thalamus; motor system; physiology; primate; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; GENERATED LIMB MOVEMENTS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTERNAL GENERATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

Magnetic resonance and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study, wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain, especially the temporal lobe and thalamus, were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp, ictal and cortical electroencephalography, MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients, Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition, hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however, corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor.

To aid in functional and structural data analysis, we have created a comprehensive parcellation of the rhesus macaque subcortex using a high-resolution ex vivo structural imaging scan. This anatomical scan and its parcellation were warped to the updated NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2), an in vivo population template, where the parcellation was refined to produce the Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (SARM) with 210 primary regions-of-interest (ROIs). The subcortical parcellation and nomenclature reflect those of the 4th edition of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos et al., in preparation ), rather than proposing yet another novel atlas. The primary ROIs are organized across six spatial hierarchical scales from small, fine-grained ROIs to broader composites of multiple ROIs, making the SARM suitable for analysis at different resolutions and allowing broader labeling of functional signals when more accurate localization is not possible. As an example application of this atlas, we have included a functional localizer for the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus in three macaques using a visual flickering checkerboard stimulus, identifying and quantifying significant fMRI activation in this atlas region. The SARM has been made openly available to the neuroimaging community and can easily be used with common MRI data processing software, such as AFNI, where the atlas has been embedded into the software alongside cortical macaque atlases.",Segmentation; Anatomy; Subcortex; Cerebellum; Thalamus; Brainstem; BRAIN ATLAS; MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; MRI; AMYGDALA; NORMALIZATION; STIMULATION; PROJECTIONS; TEMPLATE; MIDBRAIN

However, it is not clear whether the neural connections of the posteroventral part differ from those of the rest of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Here, we describe the thalamic connections of the posteroventral part of monkey area 23b (pv-area 23b), the main component of the posteroventral posterior cingulate gyrus. We compare these thalamic connections with those of the more dorsal area 23b (d-area 23b) and of adjoining retrosplenial areas 29 and 30. Thalamocortical projections to pv-area 23b originate mainly from the anterior nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. In contrast, projections to d-area 23b originate from the nucleus lateralis posterior, medial pulvinar, nucleus centralis latocellularis, mediodorsal nucleus and nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis and weakly from the anterior nuclei. Projections to retrosplenial areas 29 and 30 originate from the anterior nuclei. Corticothalamic projections from pv-area 23b terminate in the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. Projections from d-area 23b terminate in these nuclei as well as the nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis. Projections from area 30 terminate mainly in the anterior nuclei and, to a lesser extent, in the medial pulvinar. These results show that the connections of pv-area 23b differ from those of d-area 23b or areas 29 and 30. This suggests that pv-area 23b may play distinct functional roles in memory processes, such as spatial and auditory memory.",anterior thalamic nuclei; area 23b; medial pulvinar; nucleus lateralis posterior; retrosplenial cortex; RHESUS-MONKEY; RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; TETRAMETHYL BENZIDINE; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AFFERENTS; MEMORY; ANTERIOR; AMNESIA; SENSITIVITY; PROJECTIONS

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

In order to determine the origin and extent of corticocortical and thalamocortical projections to layer I of the frontal/premotor area M2 of the rat neocortex, we have used fluorescent anatomical tracing methods to determine the precise sources of cortical and thalamic input to the rostral and caudal aspects of layer I of M2. Retrograde tracer diamidino yellow (DY), applied directly to the pial surface on rostral or caudal areas of rat M2 (RM2 and CM2, respectively) labeled cells ipsilaterally throughout layers II/III, V, and VII of the adjacent primary motor area and the parietal areas (SI and SH). In addition, retrograde transport labeled contralateral CM2 or RM2 in layers II/III and V at sites homotopic to either CM2 or RM2 application sites. Contralateral layer VII was retrogradely labeled by the application to layer I of CM2, but not by the RM2 application. Retrograde DY transport from layer I of RM2 or CM2 of was seen in the ventral medial (VM), ventral lateral (VL), and posterior (Po) thalamic nuclei. However layer I transport from CM2 additionally labeled the thalamic central medial (CM) nucleus, while the RM2 labeled the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. Upon determination that thalamic nuclei VM and VL were of primary interest in this study, due to their dense retrograde labeling, injections of anterograde tracer rhodamine dextranamine (RDA) into VM or VL were performed in order to study the projection patterns of these nuclei to layer I of the frontal cortex. RDA injections into VM labeled fibers extending through layer I of both RM2 and CM2 and throughout the cingulate cortex. Injections of RDA into VL consistently labeled dense fibers in layer I of both CM2 and RM2, although labeling was sharply decreased anterior to CM2. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that projections to layer I from all sources of cortical input make a significant contribution to integration throughout the neocortex.

However, little is known about protein expression patterns in other areas of the brain. In situ hybridization studies have shown high ErbB4 mRNA levels in various subcortical areas, suggesting that ErbB4 is also expressed in cell types other than cortical interneurons. Here, using highly-specific monoclonal antibodies, we provide the first extensive report of ErbB4 protein expression throughout the cerebrum of primates. We show that ErbB4 immunoreactivity is high in association cortices, intermediate in sensory cortices, and relatively low in motor cortices. The overall immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation is intermediate, but is high in a subset of interneurons. We detected the highest overall immunoreactivity in distinct locations of the ventral hypothalamus, medial habenula, intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and structures of the ventral forebrain, such as the islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum, and medium expression in the reticular thalamic nucleus. While this pattern is generally consistent with ErbB4 mRNA expression data, further investigations are needed to identify the exact cellular and subcellular sources of mRNA and protein expression in these areas. In contrast to in situ hybridization in rodents, we detected only low levels of ErbB4-immunoreactivity in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei but a diffuse pattern of immunofluorescence that was medium in the dorsal striatum and high in the ventral forebrain, suggesting that most ErbB4 protein in dopaminergic neurons could be transported to axons. We conclude that the NRG-ErbB4 signaling pathway can potentially influence many functional systems throughout the brain of primates, and suggest that major sites of action are areas of the corticolimbic network. This interpretation is functionally consistent with the genetic association of NRG1 and ERBB4 with schizophrenia.",nan; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PARVALBUMIN-POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TYROSINE KINASE; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS

However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AROUSAL REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-STIMULI; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE; AFFERENTS

Nonhuman primate studies have highlighted the crucial role of the cerebellum for saccade adaptation, but its neural substrates in humans are poorly understood. Recent physiological experiments suggest that, in addition to cerebellar structures, cortical areas may be involved as well. We have therefore hypothesized that saccade adaptation may rely on a cerebello-cerebral network, in which the cerebellar thalamus may link cerebellar and cerebral structures. To test this hypothesis, we studied saccade adaptation in a group of four patients with a thalamic lesion, with (n=2) or without (n=2) involvement of the cerebellar thalamus. Compared to healthy subjects, saccade adaptation was reduced in patients with associated cerebellar syndrome, but normal in patients without cerebellar syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cerebello-thalamic pathways contribute to saccade adaptation in humans and suggest that the thalamus relays adaptation-related information from the cerebellum to cerebral cortical oculomotor areas.",adaptation; human; oculomotor system; saccade; thalamus; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ATAXIC HEMIPARESIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; OCULOMOTOR REGION; GAIN ADAPTATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; DENTATE NUCLEUS

Methods: Nissl-stained sections were examined to determine the boundaries of, and the distribution of neuronal sizes within, the medial pulvinar, In addition, Golgi-impregnated neurons were examined and drawn for analysis, Only rhesus monkey specimens were used, and the material had been prepared previously for other studies. Results: Projection neurons have round to oval somata and moderate numbers of primary dendrites that extend for short distances before branching into many secondary branches, Two variations of projection neurons (P1 and P2) were distinguished on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic tree, Both varieties have short dendrites that radiate in all directions, They differ in that P2 cells have longer second tier dendrites than P1 cells, Three types of local circuit neurons, tufted, radiating and varicose, were distinguished on the basis of their dendritic morphology, Four types of afferent fibers were identified. Type 1 afferents form cone-shape terminal arbors. Type 2 afferents are similar to those reported for retinal or cortical terminals, Type 3 afferents are of medium thickness and of an unknown origin, Type 4 afferents are thin and have small varicosities consistent with previously described cortical afferents, Afferent fibers are predominantly oriented along the mediolateral axis of the nucleus. We observed putative contacts between some afferents and local circuit neurons and between local circuit neurons and projection neurons, Conclusions: Medial pulvinar neurons are generally smaller and rounder than those found in the adjacent pulvinar nuclei, These results provide additional evidence for structural distinctions between thalamic nuclei having different functions, However, the observed differences are subtle, In addition, the data in this report provide morphological evidence that cortical signals are likely to be integrated by means of the circuitry located within the nucleus.

This study investigated the morphology of single axons of entopeduncular neurons projecting to the motor thalamus by placing small injections of dextran biotin into the EP and reconstructing drawings of single axone from serial sections. There were two populations of entopeduncular-thalamic projection axone: those that projected only to the motor thalamus (VL and VM) and those that projected to both the motor thalamus and other nuclei (e.g., the habenula). The neurochemistry of EP neurons projecting to the thalamus was investigated by injecting the retrograde tracer FluoroCold into the VL and VM thalamic nuclei to retrogradely fill entopeduncular projection neurons. These were subsequently immunohistochemically labeled for choline acetyl transferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Consistent with previous studies, significant proportions of these neurons were GABA immunoreactive. In addition, approximately half of the entopeduncular-thalamic projecting neurons were found to be cholinergic. This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula.

Data we obtained in one patient after a limited left thalamic infarct bring some new insights into this debate. This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch. vibration. joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities. He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior media (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely. the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological Studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission. while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.

Fractional anisotropy reflects the integrity of white matter fibers. Fractional anisotropy of a young adult brain is low in gray matter, high in white matter, and highest in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Thus, we selected the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, head of the caudate nucleus, semioval center, thalamus, and corpus callosum (splenium and genu) as regions of interest when using diffusion-tensor imaging to observe fractional anisotropy of major white matter fiber tracts and the deep gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys aged 4-8 years. Results showed no laterality differences in fractional anisotropy values. Fractional anisotropy values were low in the head of caudate nucleus and thalamus in gray matter. Fractional anisotropy values were highest in the splenium of corpus callosum in the white matter, followed by genu of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy values were lowest in the semioval center and posterior limb of internal capsule. These results suggest that fractional anisotropy values in major white matter fibers and the deep gray matter of 4-8-year-old rhesus monkeys are similar to those of healthy young people.",neural regeneration; neuroimaging; rhesus monkey; fractional anisotropy; brain; white matter; gray matter; MRI; diffusion-tensor imaging; grants-supported paper; neuroregeneration; WHITE-MATTER; ANISOTROPY; INJURY; TRACTOGRAPHY; MRI; DTI; MICROSTRUCTURE; GENDER; TIME

Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 mu m(2)) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 mu m(2)), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 mu m(2)) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 mu m(2) and 1.6 mu m(2), respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 mu m of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest.

Axons were labeled from the thalamus by a fluorescent carbocyanine dye in fixed tissue or by transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin from the eye. Thalamic axons first reached the cortex 2 weeks after birth and grew into the developing cortical plate without a waiting period in the subplate. The first thalamocortical synapses were detected 2 weeks later solely throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate, where layer 6 cells previously have been shown to reside. As the thickness of the cortex increased with age, thalamocortical synapses were increasingly prevalent in the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. With the appearance of layer 4, thalamocortical synapses were found there as well as in the marginal zone and layer 6. There was no evidence for an early population of thalamocortical synapses in the subplate. The first synapses made by thalamic axons were in a region containing layer 6 cells, one of their normal targets in the mature cortex.",electron microscopy; marsupial; waiting period; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; EARLY INGROWTH; RAT; SUBPLATE; CONNECTIONS; PATHWAY; NEURONS

Each injection resulted in anterograde labeling in the three subdivisions of the ventral anterior nucleus (pars parvicellularis, VApc; pars densicellularis, VAdc; and pars magnocellularis, VAmc) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VL). NRT fibers had beaded shapes and coursed in a posterior direction giving rise to relatively diffuse terminal plexuses. The average size of the beads (0.7 mu m(2)) and their density per 100 mu m of fiber length (23.7-25.7) were similar between the nuclei studied. At the electron microscopic level, anterogradely labeled boutons displayed positive immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and formed relatively long (similar to 0.4 mu m) symmetric synaptic contacts. Usually, a single terminal formed synapses on more than one postsynaptic structure. Synaptic contacts were on projection and local circuit neurons and targeted mainly their distal dendrites. In the VAmc, synapses on local circuit neurons composed 48% of the total sample, in the VAdc/VApc and in the VL the proportion was higher, 65% and 62%, respectively. The results suggest that the input from the anterior pole of the monkey reticular nucleus to the motor-related thalamic nuclei is organized differently from what is known on the organization of connections of NRT with sensory thalamic nuclei in other species in that the terminal fields of individual fibers are diffuse rather than focal and that at least 50% of synapses are established on GABAergic local circuit neurons.

The animals had to choose correctly between pairs of stimuli drawn from a population of 16. Four of these stimuli were associated with 0 reward pellets, four with 1 pellet, four with 2 pellets and four with 4 pellets. Mediodorsal thalamic lesions including the medial part of the mediodorsal nucleus, similar to those which are frequently seen in Korsakoff amnesia, produced a severe impairment in this task. The impairment was seen both in memory for the quantity of reward, as expressed in choices between 1-pellet and 2-pellet stimuli or choices between 2-pellet and 4-pellet stimuli, and also in memory for the qualitative absence or presence of reward, as expressed in choices between 0-pellet and 1-pellet stimuli. The deficit in this task establishes that mediodorsal thalamic lesions in monkeys can impair long-term memory tasks, in addition to their known effects on several short-term memory tasks. The contrast between the present results and those of previous experiments on visual long-term memory in the monkey following mediodorsal thalamic lesions can be related to similar contrasts in studies of lesions in the amygdala, suggesting that the functions of these two structures are related.",CYNOMOLGUS; AMNESIA; VISUAL LEARNING; MONKEYS; NUCLEUS; CORTEX

Multiple injections of combinations of two dyes (diamidino yellow dihydrochloride, Evans blue, fast blue, granular blue) were made into either the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri or into the medial and lateral regions of the anterior sigmoid gyrus in the anesthetized dog. We found that the thalamic afferents of areas 4 and 6 arise from topographically organized bands of cells that traverse several thalamic nuclei and extend throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the thalamus. The most medial band included area 6-projecting neurons in the anterior nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus, the ventral anterior nucleus (VA), ventromedial nucleus (VM) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Within this band, cells projecting to medial area 6a alpha tended to be more numerous in the anterior nuclei, anterior parts of VA and VM and anterior and caudal parts of MD. Fewer cells in MD but more cells in caudal parts of VA and VM projected to lateral area 6a beta. Lateral bands of cells in central through lateral parts of VA and VL projected topographically to lateral area 4 on the anterior sigmoid gyrus and lateral through medial parts of postcruciate area 4. The most lateral band of cells in VL continued ventrally into the zona incerta. Area 4 also received input from VM and the central lateral (CL) and centrum medianum (CM) nuclei. Within regions of VA, VL and VM, cells from one band interspersed with cells from another, but there were very few double-labeled cells projecting to two cortical sites.

Actively detecting a vibrotactile stimulus and reporting its perception elicited a sustained poststimulus beta power increase in VPL and an alpha power decrease in S1, in both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent trials. These oscillatory dynamics in the somatosensory thalamocortical network depended on the behavioral context: they were stronger for the active detection condition than for a passive stimulation condition. Furthermore, contrasting stimulus-present vs. stimulus-absent responses, we found that poststimulus theta power increased in both VPL and S1, and alpha/beta power decreased in S1, reflecting the monkey's perceptual decision but not the motor response per se. Additionally, higher prestimulus alpha power in S1 correlated with an increased probability of the monkey reporting a stimulus, regardless of the actual presence of a stimulus. Thus, we found task-related modulations in oscillatory activity, not only in the neocortex but also in the thalamus, depending on behavioral context. Furthermore, oscillatory modulations reflected the perceptual decision process and subsequent behavioral response. We conclude that these early sensory regions, in addition to their primary sensory functions, may be actively involved in perceptual decision making.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL THALAMUS

Lesions of the basal ganglia typically result in poverty of movement (e.g., akinesia) or excessive movement (e.g., hyperkinesia), and lesions of the cerebellum result in incoordination of movement (e.g., ataxia). However, recent research has revealed that in addition to the primary motor cortex, the basal ganglia and cerebellum also demonstrate projection zones to the premotor cortex, frontal eye field , and prefrontal, inferotemporal, and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting a supplementary role for these structures (i.e., basal ganglia and cerebellum) in the regulation of cognitive processes. Subcortical cognitive deficits paralleling motor impairments such as difficulty in shifting attentional set and difficulty in coordinating mental activity have been described in the neuropsychological literature. However, correlates relative to hypolinguistic or dysmetric language processes are yet to be adequately defined. Aims: The aim of the current research, therefore, was to compare and contrast the language profiles of individuals with thalamic versus cerebellar lesions. Methods & Procedures: Two cases with surgically induced lesions of the left ventral intermediate thalamus, and two cases with spontaneous vascular infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere, served as experimental subjects in this research. General and high-level language profiles were compiled for each subject and performance compared to a roup of 16 non-neurologically impaired controls (NC). The criterion for anomalous performance was established as >= 2 SD below the NC group mean. Outcomes & Results : Evident deficits were largely restricted to complex language functions, irrespective of lesion type. Of note, however, was that thalamic lesions were associated with a higher overall proportion of significantly reduced test scores, as well as greater magnitudes of decline from normal when compared to cerebellar lesions. Conclusions: These results lend support to working theories of subcortical participation in language that promote a superordinate role for the thalamus in the regulation of higher-level lexical-semantic processes. Further more , the present findings also highlight the need to consider a novel role for the left cerebellar hemisphere in coordinating cognitive-linguistic systems.",nan; RHESUS-MONKEY; LANGUAGE; LESIONS; ORGANIZATION; DIASCHISIS; DEFICITS; THOUGHT

Neurons convergent for baroreceptor and nociceptive input have also been identified in the homologous anterior insula of the primate. Whether similar convergent cells exist in the ventrobasal thalamus was investigated in 30 urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Six classes of cells were identified in the right ventrobasal thalamus: (a) 83/159 (52%) baroreceptive and nociceptive convergent units; (b) 2/159 (1%) convergent cells responding to baroreceptor activation and light touch; (c) 44/159 (28%) purely nociceptive units; (d)10/159 (6%) purely baroreceptive units; (e) 1/159 (0.6%) cells responding to brush alone and (f) 19/159 (12%) unresponsive units. Of the viscerosomatic convergent cells, 66/85 (78%) were situated in the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPL), 6/85 (7%) in the ventroposterolateral parvicellular nucleus (VPLpc), and 13/85 (15%) in the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM). Fifteen right ventrobasal thalamic units were antidromically activated and 34 units orthodromically activated by right posterior insular microstimulation. Cobalt injection into the right ventrobasal thalamus blocked the right insular response to baroreceptor activation by > 70%. These data indicate: (a) baroreceptive and somatosensory nociceptive convergent units exist in the ventrobasal thalamus; (b) thalamic convergent neurons project directly to the ipsilateral posterior insula and receive reciprocal insulothalamic projections; and (c) a significant proportion of baroreceptor input relays to the posterior insula through the ipsilateral ventrobasal thalamus.

The thalamus receives extensive feedback from the cortex and this influences the firing pattern, synchronization and sensory response mode of relay cells. A crucial question concerns the extent to which the feedback simply controls the state and transmission mode of relay cells and the extent to which the feedback participates in the specific processing of sensory information. Using examples from experiments examining the influence of feedback from the visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we argue that thalamic mechanisms are selectively focused by visually driven feedback to optimize the thalamic contribution to segmentation and global integration. This involves effects on both the temporal and spatial parameters characterizing the responses of LGN cells and includes, for example, motion-driven feedback effects from MT (middle temporal visual area) relayed via layer 6 of V1 (primary visual cortex).",lateral geniculate nucleus; corticofugal feedback; primary visual cortex; middle temporal visual area; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; LAYER-VI; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; DYNAMIC PROPERTIES; SPATIAL SUMMATION; AREAS V1; CAT

In the earliest period analyzed, from 5-6 weeks of gestation, dorsal and ventral parts of the human thalamus were poorly differentiated structures forming the sides of the third ventricle. At 6 g.w., the prospective thalamic anlage consisted of the ventricular (VZ), the intermediate (IZ) and the marginal zones (MZ). The neurons in the VZ were bipolar and radially arranged to the ventricular surface. From 6-8 gestational weeks detached bipolar or branched bipolar cells with horizontal or oblique orientation were encountered in the IZ and occasionally in the MZ. In the period between 10-14 weeks of gestation, segregation of neurons into different thalamic nuclei began. The lateral geniculate nucleus, centrum medianum and mediodorsal nucleus were the first to be distinguished. In comparison with the previous period, the neurons throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the thalamus were more differentiated, with a higher number of primary dendrites that were often bifurcated. This resulted in various shapes of immature neurons: simple uni- and bipolar (type 1), branched uni- and bipolar (type 2) and young multipolar (type 3). In addition, the first spines were frequently observed on dendrites at 12 weeks of gestation. At 14-16 weeks of gestation, segregation of the neurons into thalamic nuclei continued. The neurons exhibited further dendritic differentiation that followed the caudo rostral gradient. For the first time, multipolar neurons, especially in the caudal part, could be sub-divided into two classes: multipolar with a 'bushy' appearance, the result of many primary dendrites with several bifurcations and 'simpler' multipolar neurons with fewer and less branched primary dendrites. Neuronal differentiation was further expressed by an increase in the total dendritic length and somatic surface, up to six and three times, respectively, from the earliest period analyzed to 16 weeks of gestation. Dendritic length increased initially by the formation of new primary branches and their elongation and secondly by formation of higher branch orders. At 16 g.w., a group of immature cells were observed dorsally, on the frontal sections through the rostral thalamus.

While both subcortical structures process information in basically segregated loops that primarily interact in the neocortex, direct subcortical interaction has been recently confirmed by neuroanatomical studies using viral transneuronal tracers in non-human primate brains. The thalamus is thought to be the main relay station of both projection systems. Yet, our understanding of subcortical basal ganglia and cerebellar interconnectivity within the human thalamus is rather sparse, primarily due to limitation in the acquisition of in vivo tracing. Consequently, we strive to characterize projections of both systems and their potential overlap within the human thalamus by diffusion MRI and tractography. Our analysis revealed a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient for pallido-thalamic connections in: (1) the ventral-anterior thalamus, (2) the intralaminar nuclei, and (3) midline regions. Conversely, we found a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient for dentato-thalamic projections predominantly in: (1) the ventral-lateral and posterior nucleus; (2) dorsal parts of the intralaminar nuclei and the subparafascicular nucleus, and (3) the medioventral and lateral mediodorsal nucleus. A considerable overlap of connectivity pattern was apparent in intralaminar nuclei and midline regions. Notably, pallidal and cerebellar projections were both hemispherically lateralized to the left thalamus. While strikingly consistent with findings from transneuronal studies in non-human primates as well as with pre-existing anatomical studies on developmentally expressed markers or pathological human brains, our assessment provides distinctive connectional fingerprints that illustrate the anatomical substrate of integrated functional networks between basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Thereby, our findings furnish useful implications for cerebellar contributions to the clinical symptomatology of movement disorders.",Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; Connectivity; Diffusion MRI; Hemispheric lateralization; CENTROMEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACACA-MULATTA; MOTOR CORTEX; NUCLEUS; CONNECTIONS

The inferior pulvinar (PI) complex consisted of multiple subdivisions and encompassed the classic PI, and adjacent ventral parts of the lateral and medial pulvinar (PL and Phl, respectively). In keeping with nomenclature suggested previously for macaques, the PI subdivisions were termed the posterior, medial, central, lateral, and lateral-shell (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S). In both species, PIP was intense for calbindin, light for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and very light for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) histochemistry. The PIM was calbindin poor, AChE rich, and moderate for WFA. The PIC was calbindin intense, lighter for AChE, and exhibited little WFA binding. PIL and PIL-S contained populations of large calbindin or WFA cells that were more numerous in PIL-S. Although staining with the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 differed between macaques and squirrel monkeys, the same subdivisions were displayed, Moderately dense, patchy Cat-301 stain was found in PIM of macaques, whereas in squirrel monkeys PIM was Light. Connections of the rostral dorsolateral (DLr) and middle temporal (MT) areas of visual cortex in squirrel monkeys were compared with PI subdivisions revealed by the neu er histochemical methods in the same cases. The major connections of DLr were with PIC and of MT were with PIM.

We studied the responsiveness of neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) to electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), and the ventral subnucleus of the thalamus (VPLo) with chronically implanted electrodes. 2. All neurons examined in this study were characterized by their relation to a motor task performed by the animals. They responded to stimulation of the cortical or thalamic area with excitation from one area alone (n = 128) or from multiple areas (n = 84) of all combinations. In a majority of neurons, response latencies to both cortical and thalamic stimulation were within 5 ms. 3. A vast majority of neurons (80%) that were active during a preparatory period for forthcoming reaching movements were activated by SMA stimulation. They were activated only infrequently by SI or thalamic stimulation. 4. Movement-related neurons(active immediately before and during reaching movements) were activated by thalamic, SI, or SMA stimulation or by any combination of those stimuli. More than half of the movement-related neurons activated exclusively by either thalamic or SMA stimulation exhibited activity onset times earlier than those observed in the earliest muscles. By contrast, most movement-related neurons that responded only to SI stimulation were late in their activity onset. 5. These findings suggest that the SMA input to MI is important in developing a preparatory type of activity in MI, whereas the thalamus (VPLo) provides substantial inputs in movement execution. The roles played by inputs from SI and SMA in relation to motor execution an debatable and are discussed here with reference to previous reports.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PROXIMAL FORELIMB MOVEMENTS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACACA-MULATTA; THALAMIC INPUT

Thalamic infarcts in paramedian artery territory are seen fairly frequently owing to certain peculiarities of the vascularization of the thalamus. However, clinical diagnosis is usually difficult because of the many varieties and peculiarities of the symptomatology. Material and Methods. We present a review of twelve cases of bilateral paramedian infarcts of the thalamus seen in our Department of Neurology and in a private surgery. We analyze the symptoms and their relationship to the neuro-radiological findings. Finally we compare our observations with the descriptions published by other authors and seek an anatomo-functional relationship for each of the symptoms and signs observed. Results. The usual clinical outline in our patients included disorders of consciousness, different types of oculomotor disorders and cerebellar symptoms, mainly of gait. Other less common findings were memory disorders and abnormal movements. In no case were there sensory changes and pyramidal signs were rare in the absence of significant extra-thalamic lesions. Conclusions. Our findings, although generally comparable to those described in the literature consulted, were somewhat different with regard to cerebellar symptoms arm the absence of sensory and pyramidal signs. We also emphasize the marked differences seen between the individual patients in our series. A good knowledge of the possible clinical variants of these lesions is necessary for a correct initial diagnostic approach in the study of these patients [REVNEUROL 1997, 25. 1353-62].",amnesia; ataxia; disorder of consciousness; eye movement; ictus; infarct; paramedian artery; thalamus; FRONTAL-LOBE; COMMUNICATING ARTERY; DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEY; MIDBRAIN; MEMORY; DISORDERS; LESIONS; NUCLEUS

Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the ventral parts of dentate nuclei. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the VL were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the thalamus. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the VL either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different VL locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the thalamus. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the VL that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.

Brain tissue from macaques was immunoreacted by means of antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to histamine and processed for light and electron microscopy. A dense plexus of thin, highly branched ChAT-immunoreactive axons laden with varicosities was found in all layers of the dLGN including the koniocellular laminae and in the pregeniculate nucleus. ChAT label was more dense in magnocellular layers 1 and 2 than in parvocellular layers 3-6 and relatively sparse in the interlaminar zones. Varicosities associated with the cholinergic axons had an average of three conventional asymmetric synapses per varicosity, and these appeared to contact dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons. Histamine-immunoreactive axons were distributed homogeneously throughout all laminar and interlaminar zones of the dLGN, but mere denser in the pregeniculate nucleus than in the dLGN. Histaminergic axons branched infrequently and were typically larger in caliber than cholinergic axons. The overwhelming majority of varicosities were found en passant and rarely displayed conventional synapses, despite the abundance of synaptic vesicles, and were not associated preferentially with specific cellular structures. The innervation of the macaque dLGN complex by cholinergic and histaminergic systems is consistent with their proposed role in state dependent modulation of thalamic activity. The dense and highly synaptic innervation by cholinergic axons supports the proposal of additional involvement of these axons in functions related to eye movements. Anat Rec 255:295-305, 1999.

Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.",Anterior intraparietal area; area 5; area 7; lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; pulvinar; VENTRAL PREMOTOR AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VISUAL GUIDANCE; NEW-WORLD; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX

Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.

Although CYPIBI protein is known to metabolize estradiol to catecholestrogens in the uterus. its localization and function in brain have not yet been described. To better understand CYPIBI distribution, we have combined in situ hybridization (ISH) for its mRNA with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CYPIBI protein in selected brain regions of male and female adult rhesus monkey mulatta).

Results indicated widespread distribution of CYPIBI mRNA in both male and female monkey frontal cortex, hippocampus. thalamus, and amygdala. In contrast, although CYPIBI protein was co-localized with its mRNA in the female brains, it was primarily restricted to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the male brains.

To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness.

In order to compare these with histologically demonstrated connections of the PPN in monkeys, and thus to Support the use of PDT in humans, we have carried out PDT in a fixed rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) brain. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was carried out in a fixed post-mortem rhesus monkey brain using diffusion data acquired at 3T MRI (60 directions x 5 averages, b = 3000 s/mm(2), matrix size = 104 x 132 x 96, 720 x 720 x 720 mu m voxels). We identified the major connections of the PPN from single seed voxels that could be confidently located within the nucleus on the diffusion images. The organisation of these connections within a 3 x 3 x 3 voxel (similar to 10 mm(3)) region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. PDT confirmed that the rhesus monkey PPN connections with the basal ganglia and motor cortical areas matched those previously demonstrated using conventional anatomical tracing techniques. Furthermore, although the Organisation Of subcortical connections within the PPN has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, we show here in a rhesus monkey that there are clearly separated connections of the PPN with the thalamus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Thus, in addition to increasing confidence in the accuracy of PDT for tracing PPN connections and determining the Organisation of these connections within the PPN in vivo, our observations suggest that diffusion tractography will be a useful new technique to rapidly identify connections in animal brains pre-mortem and post-mortem.

However, mapping the neuronal projections with individual-axon resolution in the large and complex primate brain is still challenging. Herein, we describe a highly efficient pipeline for three-dimensional mapping of the entire macaque brain with subcellular resolution. The pipeline includes a novel poly-N-acryloyl glycinamide (PNAGA)based embedding method for long-term structure and fluorescence preservation, high-resolution and rapid whole-brain optical imaging, and image post-processing. The cytoarchitectonic information of the entire macaque brain was acquired with a voxel size of 0.32 gm x 0.32 gm x 10 gm, showing its anatomical structure with cell distribution, density, and shape. Furthermore, thanks to viral labeling, individual long-distance projection axons from the frontal cortex were for the first time reconstructed across the entire brain hemisphere with a voxel size of 0.65 gm x 0.65 gm x 3 gm. Our results show that individual cortical axons originating from the prefrontal cortex simultaneously target multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain. This pipeline provides an efficient method for cellular and circuitry investigation of the whole macaque brain with individual-axon resolution, and can shed light on brain function and disorders.

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2-3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b-4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.
